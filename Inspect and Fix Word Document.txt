It crucial to ensure that documents are accessible to people with disabilities. Checking and fixing accessibility issues in documents promotes inclusivity compliance with accessibility standards and grants equal access of information to users. It improves readability, usability, and navigation, benefiting all users. It will enhance user experience and facilitates understanding of content, fostering inclusivity, diversity, and equal opportunities for all to obtain information.
How to find and use the "Check Accessibility" tool
The "Check Accessibility" is a tool that performs a full and thorough check for whether the document conforms to accessibility standards. It finds any issues such as the missing use of alternative text on images, presence of complex tables, missing document language, and hardto read fonts' colors to be corrected. By following these steps, it'll enable the checker to identify and address the accessibility issues in the document:
Finding the Accessibility Checker

Fixing Common Accessibility Issues in Microsoft Word
Some of the issues that we will be covering are:
• Missing Object Description: Missing alternative text on an image.
• Use of Merged or Spilt Cells: Creation of a complex table.
• Hard-to-Read Text Contrast: Light or faint contrast between text and document background.
These are the most common issues to be found in a Word document. Going over these common issues in this guide by inspecting and fixing the errors so that the document can become compliant. 
Fixing Accessibility Issue: Missing Object Description
Missing Object Description is crucial for individuals who are blind or visually impaired, as screen readers rely on alternative text, also known as alt text, to convey the meaning of images. Alt text allows these users to understand the context and purpose of the images making the document more accessible and inclusive. Additionally, alt text is useful in situations where the image cannot be displayed due to technical issues or when the document is being accessed by devices with limited visual capabilities. By providing accurate and descriptive alt text, it ensures that the document can be understood by a wider range of users.
Giving Alternative Text to Images, Pictures, and Clip Art.
It helps screen and document reading tools describe images to visually impaired readers. Giving alternative text when an image, picture or clip art does not have one or has a generated crated one can be done in a few steps:  There are two ways to give an images alternative text.
First Way to Give an Image Alternative Text
1. Right click on the image.

2. Select "View Alt Text" Option.

3. The "Alt Text" box will appear to the right of the document.

4. In the input text box give a description of the image unless the image is decorative and does not need to be read out - in that case proceed to step 5. In this case the image does need alternative text. Write "Great Seal of Nevada" in the Alt Text input box to describe the image.

Now the image has meaningful alternative text.
5. *If an image is of no importance such as it a decorative image or line(s) to divide page or repeating logos/images that does not need to be read, then it can be marked as decorative instead. This will cause the screen reader to overlook the image. *Below the input text box where the description of the image is given. Select the check box called "Mark as decorative" to checkmark it. The rest of Alt Text box will be greyed out/ inaccessible to use after check marking the Mark as decorative check box.

                          Now the image will no longer be read out. Second Way to Give Alternative Text to an Image
By using the Accessibility Inspection Results / Accessibility Assistant box to the right of the document.
1. Go to the Accessibility Assistant on the right side of the screen.

2. Click on the error Missing alt text. It'll open the specific cause(s) of the error.

3. The Accessibility Assistant, Missing Alt Text dialog box will appear. Enter the description into the input field. In this case write "Great Seal of Nevada" to describe the image. "Then click the approve button to return to the main Accessibility Assistant dialog box.

4. Repeat steps 1 through 3 for each image missing alt text.
Now that all the images have been given alternative text or marked as decorative the Missing alt text error in the Accessibility Assistant box will disappear, as there are no more erros  of this kind that needs to be fixed. 
 Fixing Accessibility Issue: Use of Merge or Spilt Cells
 Removing Merged or Spilt Cells from Tables
Merged and Spilt cells should not be used in a table. This is because that can cause confusion to the reading order making the information in the table difficult for screen and document readers to follow. People using screen readers will read one cell at a time and expect one row or column header for each cell in the table so that it doesn't lose content. Follow these steps to create a simple table structure for data only. There are two ways to correct this problem:
First Option to Fix the Table: Manually
1. Go to the table that has the merged or spilt cells 
Merged Cells
a. Select the cell(s) that have been merged cell in the table.

b. Then when it is highlighted grey, right-click inside the selected cell and select the Split Cells option from the drop-down menu.

Split Cells
a. Select the cell(s) that have been spilt cell in the table.

b. Then when it is highlighted grey, right-click inside the selected cell and select the Merged Cells option from the drop-down menu.

Now the Merged or Spilt Cell errors have been resolved and a simple table structure has been created.

Second Option to Fix the Table: Using the Accessibility Inspection Results/
Accessibility Assistant
1. Go to the Accessibility Assistant Results to the right of the document.

2. Select the error "Use of merged or spilt cells." It'll open the specific cause of the error.

3. Click on the issue called "Merge Cells" and Word will automatically merge the split cells.

4. Or click the issue called "Split Cells".

5. And the Split Cell dialog box will appear. Enter the appropriate number columns or rows the selection should be split into.

6. Click ok.

Now that the Merged or Splits Cells error(s) from the table has been fixed, this'll cause the error to disappear from the Accessibility Assistant Results box. Screen readers will now easily be able to follow and read the information from the table.
Fixing Accessibility Issues of Hard-to-Read Contrast
WCAG Color Contrast Requirements
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.4.3 establishes the color contrast standards for the visual display of text and text-based images. It's essential to ensure that all text elements have adequate contrast between the foreground text and the background color, even if the text is part of an image.
Large text is defined as 18 points (24 CSS pixels) or 14 points bold (19 CSS pixels). Small text is defined as as any text that is smaller than 18 points (24 CSS pixels) or 14 points bold (19 CSS pixels). This distinction is important for determining the necessary contrast ratios to ensure readability and visual clarity for users, particularly those with visual impairments. For WCAG AA compliance, a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 is required for normal (small) text and 3:1 for large text. 
For WCAG AAA compliance, the required contrast ratio is at least 7:1 for normal (small) text and 4.5:1 for large text.
Setting a Compliant Color Contrast Ratio
Text is more readable when there is adequate contrast between the text and the document background. Good contrast is essential for effective design, benefiting all users, particularly those with low vision. Text that is difficult to read typically has poor contrast or an elaborate font style, which makes the document challenging for both high- and low-vision readers. By following these steps, you can achieve good contrast in your document:
Foreground (Text) Color
1. In Microsoft Word, go to the Accessibility Assistant Results box to the right of the document and under Color and Contrast, click on "Hard-to-read text contrast".

2. The Hard-to-read text contrast box will open. Click on one of the colors under "Try one of these colors to resolve". Word will highlight the problem words or sentence in the document and will change the font color to what you selected.

a. Note: If you don't like any of the recommended colors, click on "More Font Colors" and choose another color. 
  
b. If that doesn't provide the results you are looking for, you can click on Page Background and change the color of the background to correct the color contrast issue. However, this is not recommended as this will change the background color of all pages in the document, not just the area you are trying to fix the color contrast on.

3. Once you've chosen a color with enough contrast to meet ADA requirements, the Accessibility Assistant will show the issue in a lighter gray text with a check mark to the right indicating the issue has been resolved.

webaIM contrast checker 
what does webaIM check for?
WCAG AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.  
WCAG AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.
Web AIM Contrast Checker can check the color contrast of a document. Using it to check the text color and the background against different sizes of text will show if the contrast passes the required WCAG of both A and AA. It is recommended to pass AAA, when possible. If the contrast does not meet the above requirements, changes can be made by changing and/or adjusting the color contrast of the document's content and background to make it easier to read the information and comply with ADA color contrast requirements.
usIng the webaIM contrast checker
Text is easier to read when there is a sufficient contrast between the page background and the text or other elements on the page. If unsure what would be an acceptable color for a good color contrast ratio, then changing to a darker version of the font color may help. For a more accurate contrast choice you can use a color contrast checker.
A good resource is to use Web AIM Contrast Checker Website Resource, an online checker to verify WCAG AA and WCAG AAA compliancy from normal to large size text.
Foreground (Text) Color
1. Once the website has opened the Contrast Checker can be used.

2. Go to the document and click on the Home Tab.

3. Select the words/sentences with the contrast error. 

4. Find the "Font Color" tool and select the arrow next to the tool. A drop-down menu will appear with color options. 

5. Select the "More Colors." 

6. The "Colors" box will appear.

7. Select the "Custom Tab."

8. Find where it says "Hex," in its input box that is the hexadecimal number of the font color that is causing the error to the document.

9. Copy the hexadecimal number of the font color.

10. Once the hexadecimal number is copied go back to the Web AIM Contrast Checker website.
11. In the Contrast Checker website find the "Foreground Color input box and copy the hexadecimal number copied in Step 9 into the input box."

12. Then press the "tab" key on the keyboard. Now the text color from the document will appear.

Background (Page) Color
If the background color of the document you are checking for color contrast is white, you can skip checking the background color (skip to Step 18 below) as WebAIM Color Contrast Checker defaults to white. If a background color has been applied, follow the steps below:
1. Enter page color in the search bar at the top of the word document

2. Then choose Page color from the drop-down menu

3. Then choose More Colors at the bottom of the Theme Colors drop-down menu.

4. Locate the Hex field input box, and copy the Hexadecimal code in the input box.
5. Open the WebAIM Color Contrast Checker and paste the hexadecimal code you copied into the background Hex Value input field. The color picker under the hex value will show the background color.

6. Check to see if the Contrast Checker passed the color of the document. Scroll down the website to see if it passes WCAG standards in "Normal," "Large" and "Graphical Objects and User Interface Components with a minimum of AA." If it does not go the top of the webpage, back to Foreground Color.

7. Under the hexadecimal number input box there is a tool called "Lightness."

8. In the Lightness tool there is a sliding bar tool. It is used to change the color that is in the hexadecimal input box. It makes the color darker or lighter depending on where the slide tool is positioned. The hexadecimal number will change depending on the position of the slide tool.

9. Once you've found a contrast ratio color that has passed the WCAG's standards, the Checker will provide you with a pass for all WCAG AA normal text, large text and  graphical objects and user interface components. It is recommended to pass AAA, whenever possible.

10. Select the new hexadecimal color from the Contrast Checker and right-click and choose Copy from the drop-down menu.

11. Go back to the Microsoft Word document. Then go to the Colors box to the Custom tab. If the Colors box has been previously closed, follow the steps below to open the Colors box.
12. Select the text that is hard to read
13. Click the font icon drop-down button

14. When the Theme Color dialog box opens, choose the "More Colors" option.

15. Be in the Custom tab of the Colors box.

16. Find where it says "Hex" and paste the new hexadecimal number from the Contrast Checker. Then press the "Tab" button on the keyboard.

17. To the right of the Hex input box there is a box with two colors. The top that says New is the color from the contrast checker pasted in, the other is the color that is currently being used and is causing the problem for the document.

18. Click on the OK button.

19. Now the selected words/sentence with the contrast error has changed color to the one from the contrast checker and meets ADA Color Contrast requirements. 

20. Now there are no more Hard-to-Read Text Contrast errors. The error has now disappeared from the Accessibility Inspection Results.
