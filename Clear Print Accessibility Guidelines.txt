Clear Print Accessibility Guidelines


[]

CNIB’s goal is to create a better Canada – a barrier-free Canada – where every individual, regardless of vision loss, is able to fully participate in the world around them.

Creating this barrier-free Canada means not only ensuring buildings and roadways are safe and accessible for all citizens to enjoy; it also means ensuring that the way we communicate with each other is just as accessible – things like signs, ads, books, websites, brochures, product packages and so many other communication materials we absorb in everyday life.

How do we do that? By making the print we produce as clear and readable as possible.

Type Colour

Printed material is most readable in black and white. If using coloured text, restrict it to things like titles, headlines or highlighted material.

Paper finish

Use a matte or non-glossy finish to cut down on glare. Reduce distractions by not using watermarks or complicated background designs.
