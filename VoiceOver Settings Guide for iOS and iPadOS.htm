<p>for iOS and iPadOS 18.5</p>
<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
<p>VoiceOver is Apple’s screen reader, which can be found across all
Apple platforms, from iPhones, iPads, Macs, iPods, etc. This guide will
document how each setting in VoiceOver’s settings on iOS and iPadOS
affects the way VoiceOver behaves, as well as what the options do.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, May 2025, the release of iOS 19 and
associated operating systems is really closed to being released in beta.
Once they release to the public, this guide will be updated to reflect
new changes, features, and settings.</p>
<h3 id="main-voiceover-settings-screen">Main VoiceOver settings
screen</h3>
<p>The main VoiceOver settings screen gives you quick access to learn
about VoiceOver gestures, try a VoiceOver tutorial, and launch VoiceOver
practice, as well as customization options to further customize
VoiceOver to your liking.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>VoiceOver toggle switch</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Use this toggle to turn VoiceOver on or off. When turning off
VoiceOver, you may get an alert asking if you are sure you want to
disable VoiceOver.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Information on basic gestures, as well as a link to learn more.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Basic gestures listed include selecting an item under your finger
and activating the selected item. Other VoiceOver gestures can be found
by clicking the learn more link.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>A “What’s new in VoiceOver” link which will show you everything that
is new in VoiceOver for the current major release, such as iOS 18.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>iOS 18 is currently the only release to have this link, but as new
versions of iOS come out, they should hopefully have this link as
well.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>VoiceOver practice:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Brings up a screen to practice VoiceOver gestures and allows you to
perform any gesture on the screen to have VoiceOver read it back to you,
and what it does, such as notifying you that the swipe right gesture
moves to the next item.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>VoiceOver Tutorial</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Brings up an interactive tutorial to teach you how to use VoiceOver
from the very beginning.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>SPEAKING RATE</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to adjust the speaking rate of the current voice (how
fast or slow VoiceOver talks).</li>
</ul>
<p>The remainder of the VoiceOver settings screen is devoted to
customizing VoiceOver, such as the voice, braille options, verbosity
options, etc.</p>
<h3 id="speech">Speech</h3>
<p>The speech options allow you to change the primary voice, add voices
to the voice rotor, adjust pronunciations, and more.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Primary Voice</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Here is where you can control the primary voice to be used with
VoiceOver. If you have not added any other voices to your voice rotor,
this will be the voice that VoiceOver uses by default when speaking text
in your native language. If you have not customized this before, this
will be set to Samantha if your language is English US. The default
voice is different based on the language of your device.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>ADDITIONAL VOICES</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Add voices to the voice rotor, and they will show up in this
section. You can tap on the voice to customize it.</li>
<li>At the bottom of this section will be an option to add a voice.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Pitch Change</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This controls if VoiceOver should change pitch. This is a global
setting. This will not affect the pitch you have selected per
voice.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Detect Languages</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Toggles whether VoiceOver should read text in other languages in
that language, or try to process it in your native language.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Pronunciations</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to adjust how VoiceOver speaks certain words. For
example, you could change the way VoiceOver says VO from “Voe” to “V O”.
#### Adding a voice When you press the add voice button, you will be
presented with a list of languages. After selecting a language, you will
be shown a list of voices in that language. This list can range from
just 1 or 2 voices to hundreds depending on your language. I will list
the supported languages and voices at the end of this guide.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="voice-customization-options">Voice customization options</h4>
<p>Depending on the voice you have selected, the customization options
may vary. ##### General customizations For all voices, the following
options will be available to you: (The options in this screen only
affect the voice you are currently editing and do not affect other
voices.)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Voice – Option to change the voice (only appears for the primary
voice. Delete and re-add a voice from the rotor if you added the wrong
voice).</li>
<li>RATE</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>allows you to adjust the rate for the current voice.</li>
<li>This adjusts the rate per voice. Adjusting the speaking rate slider
in the main VoiceOver settings controls the speaking rate of the primary
voice.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>PITCH</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to adjust how high or low the voice talks for normal
speech.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>SPEECH VOLUME</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>adjusts how loud or quiet the voice is (does not adjust system
volume).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Voice specific customization options</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>shows customization options per voice (see below).</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>audio effects</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>As of iOS 18, the only audio effect is the equalizer, which will
allow you to adjust particular frequencies to make them louder or
quieter. Each band of the EQ can be adjusted plus or negative 20 DB,
with 0 being the default.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Reset Voice Settings</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>resets all of your settings for the particular voice to the
default.</li>
<li>This option does not warn you before resetting your options to
default.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="voice-specific-customization-options">Voice specific
customization options</h5>
<p>Each TTS (Text To Speech) engine has its own customization option,
and will be listed below. These options can be found when editing a
voice as described above.</p>
<h6 id="macintalk-alex-fred-etc.">MacinTalk (Alex, Fred, etc).</h6>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pitch Range</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Adjusts the inflection of the voice.</li>
<li>0 is no inflection, where the voice sounds almost like a robot, with
200 being the max. The default is 100.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>WPM Minimum</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>adjusts how slow the voice speaks when the rate is at 0%. This can
go from 50 to 175 words per minute.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>WPM Maximum</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Adjusts the fastest the voice can speak. 500 is the default, but
this can be adjusted up to 900 words per minute.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="vocalizer-includes-nicky-english-u.s..">Vocalizer (includes
Nicky, English U.S.).</h6>
<ol type="1">
<li>Timbre</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Adjusts the formants and slightly adjusts the pitch of the voice.
The lower the number, the more the voice sounds deeper and bigger. When
the number is above 100, the voice will sound more like a small child or
chipmunk. 100 is the default.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Sentence Pause</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>adjusts how long VoiceOver should wait after speaking a sentence
before going on to the next one.</li>
<li>This does not apply to reading back controls, such as “Search,
button”, or “VoiceOver, heading”. This applies to reading full
sentences, such as “Hello. The weather is nice today.”</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="eloquence">Eloquence</h6>
<ol type="1">
<li>Rate Multiplier</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Adjusts the speed that Eloquence speaks at a current rate. The
default is 100, but this control can be adjusted from 50 to 200.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Head Size</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>similar to tamber for vocalizer voices, but does not adjust
pitch.</li>
<li>Drag the slider down to make the head size smaller, and adjust it
upwards to make the head size bigger.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Pitch Base</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is like the pitch slider. You can adjust the pitch base in
hertz. The default is 65Hz, but the slider can go from 40 to 422Hz.
Note: if you adjust the pitch base to the lowest or highest setting, it
may be slightly harder to set it back to 65Hz. You can double tap and
hold, and then drag left and right to find 65Hz. Alternatively, reset
the voice back to its defaults.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Pitch Range</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Just like MacinTalk voices, it adjusts the inflection of the voice.
The default is 30, but this value can go from 0 to 100.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Breathiness</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It adds a breathiness to the voice. At 100, the voice is a whisper.
The default is 0.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Roughness</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It adds a roughness to the voice which makes it sound deeper without
changing the pitch. The effect is hard to explain, so I would recommend
you try it out yourself.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Higher Sample Rate</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This adjusts the sample rate of Eloquence. This changes the way the
voice sounds. Experiment with this to see which option you like
better.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Phrase Prediction</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Phrase Prediction attempts to add a pause, such as for a comma if
none exists in the content that is being read.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Abbreviation Dictionary</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It attempts to change the way the speech synthesizer pronounces
abbreviations.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>Community Dictionary</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>It attempts to fix the pronunciations of some words that the speech
synthesizer gets wrong.</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="siri-english-us-only">Siri (English US only)</h6>
<p>For the English US Siri voices, you can change the speaking style of
the voice. This is available for all 5 Siri voices.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Default</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This is the default speaking style of the voice.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Even Inflection</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This evens out the inflection of the voice, almost like reducing the
pitch range with other voices.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Faster Pace</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Uses basically the default inflection but makes the voice speak
faster.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Even Inflection &amp; Faster Pace</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Allows you to use even inflection while making the voice speak
faster.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Narration</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This allows you to make the voice sound more like it is narrating
something. This changes the speaking style more than the other
presets.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all other Siri voices, there are no customization options beyond
the default ones available for all voices.</p>
<h4 id="pronunciations">Pronunciations</h4>
<p>This screen allows you to manually adjust the pronunciations of words
and phrases you add.</p>
<ol type="1">

<h3 id="voiceover-recognition">VoiceOver Recognition</h3>
<p>VoiceOver recognition allows you to get image descriptions from
controls, as well as screen recognition, which makes apps more
accessible.</p>
<h4 id="live-recognition">Live Recognition</h4>
<p>This option is used to determine which live recognition options
appear in the live recognition rotor or when you invoke live recognition
with a four-finger triple tap or a custom gesture. The ordering may
vary, but the available options are as follows: (Options requiring the
LightR sensor will not display on iPhones or iPads without this sensor.)
1. People: Detects people that enter the view of your camera. 2. Doors:
Detects doors and lets you know any information on the door and how to
open it. 3. Scenes: Gives you image descriptions like in apps or
websites but from your camera. 4. Point and Speak: Allows you to point
your camera at text and have text under your finger read back to you,
such as a microwave or stove control panel. 5. Text: Reads text in the
view of your camera, similar to Seeing AI’s Short Text Channel. 6.
Furniture: Speaks any furniture shown in your camera such as a bed or
couch.</p>
<h4 id="image-descriptions">Image Descriptions</h4>
<p>Allows VoiceOver to read back image descriptions from apps and
websites. 1. Image Descriptions: Toggle this switch to turn the feature
on/off. 2. Download information: Displays the amount of storage used for
offline use, or shows that a download is required. 3. SENSITIVE CONTENT
OUTPUT: Determines how VoiceOver outputs potentially sensitive content
in images. - Speak: Speaks that sensitive content exists. - Play Sound:
Plays a sound whenever sensitive content is detected. - Do Nothing: Does
not announce or play a sound when sensitive content is displayed in an
image. 3. Additional Languages: Allows you to add languages for images
to be described in. 4. Apply to Apps: Gives you a list to automatically
describe images in. Select an app to have VoiceOver describe images
automatically in that app. Deselect it to not have image descriptions
read back to you automatically. You can always use a custom gesture to
describe an image. #### Screen Recognition Screen Recognition allows for
apps to be more accessible when enabled in the rotor. 1. Screen
Recognition: Use this switch to disable or enable screen recognition. 2.
Download information: Shows if a download is required or how much space
is used. 3. Apply to Apps: Allows you to select apps for screen
recognition to work in. - Note: If screen recognition is enabled in an
app and you can’t disable it, you can focus on the app in the app
switcher and turn screen recognition off from the rotor. #### Text
Recognition Automatically describe text in apps and websites. This can
work even if image descriptions are turned off. #### Feedback Style
Determines how image descriptions are output. 1. Speak: Speaks the image
and possible text. 2. Play Sound: Plays a sound whenever a description
is read. VoiceOver will read text in an image without first saying
“possible text”. 3. Do Nothing: Behaves the same as playing a sound
where VoiceOver will not announce “possible text”. Images and text will
still be read. ### Verbosity The verbosity options control how VoiceOver
outputs certain types of controls/events.</p>

index finger or your thumb and third finger.</p>
<p>Another way people use to activate the rotor is to put two fingers on
the screen and move one up while moving the other one down.
Alternatively, you can put 2 fingers on the screen and move one left and
the other one right. If you are doing this, make sure that your fingers
are on top of each other but not touching if moving horizontally, or
right next to each other if using the vertical method described. You can
move your fingers in both directions as long as they are moving opposite
each other to change the rotor to the next/previous item.</p>
<p>To adjust the rotor item, use a one-finger swipe up/down.</p>
