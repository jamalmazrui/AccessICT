<p>Preface</p>
<p>Purpose and Intended Audience</p>
<p>This user guide provides guidance on accessing Portable Document
Format (PDF) documents for blind and visually impaired users of screen
reading technology. The goal is to enable a better understanding of the
issues that affect the accessibility of PDF documents by discussing
specific examples, highlighting important principles, illustrating
common problems, and presenting suggested solutions.</p>
<p>Techniques for opening scanned, untagged, and tagged documents will
be presented, along with guidance for working with PDF files that
contain tables, headings, images, and basic form controls.</p>
<p>Specific instructions in this document refer to menu and command
names in Adobe® Reader® 8.0 software. More generally, however, the
procedures and features described also apply to reading PDF documents in
Adobe Acrobat® 8.0 Professional and Adobe Acrobat 8.0 Standard – though
the specific menu and command names may differ.</p>
<p>While this guide is intended for entry-level end users, it assumes
that the users have already learned the basics of using their particular
screen reader for accomplishing basic tasks such as using a word
processor and browsing the Internet.</p>
<p>Contents</p>
<p>Following this preface, this guide begins with the three sections
that apply to all screen reader users:</p>
<p>• Accessible PDF documents – Introduces the Portable Document Format
(PDF) and characteristics</p>
<p>of accessible PDFs</p>
<p>• Adobe Reader accessibility features – Describes features in Adobe
Reader relevant to</p>
<p>users of assistive technology</p>
<p>• Types of PDF files – Describes four common types of PDF documents
and relevant</p>
<p>accessibility issues for each.</p>
<p>These sections are followed by detailed information on using specific
screen readers. Two Windows-based screen reading applications are
covered:</p>
<p>• JAWS</p>
<p>• Window-Eyes</p>
<p>The final section describes how to perform common tasks with a screen
reader, and provides guidance on installing Adobe Reader, navigating PDF
documents, and using the Adobe Reader Help system.</p>

Documents and Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>Portable Document Format (PDF) is an electronic file format developed
by Adobe Systems Inc. PDF is one of the most popular file formats used
on the Internet. The free Adobe Reader software -- available for
Microsoft Windows, Apple Macintosh, and UNIX -- allows a PDF document’s
visual integrity to hold true regardless of the computer used to view
it.</p>
<p>Because PDF is used for such wide-ranging documents as product
manuals, financial and legal documents, government related forms, and
educational materials, it is critically important that people using
screen readers have proper access to this format. PDF is an electronic
format, giving it an advantage over paper documents because PDF
documents can be accessed via synthetic speech or refreshable
Braille.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, PDF and screen readers do not always interact as users
would like. The main barrier to accessibility is that PDF documents are
not always designed by their authors to be compatible with screen
readers. These issues, caused by lack of planning for accessibility,
mirror Internet accessibility issues that occur when a Web designer
fails to follow the accessibility guidelines of the World Wide Web
Consortium’s Web Accessibility Initiative. Adobe has developed a number
of tools and resources to make it easier for</p>
<p>authors to create accessible PDF documents; these are available a<a
href="http://www.adobe.com/accessibility">t
http://www.adobe.com/accessibility</a>.</p>
<p>Characteristics of an accessible PDF document</p>
<p>All accessible PDF documents have the following five
characteristics:</p>
<p>A logical structure and reading order</p>
<p>For screen readers to read a PDF document effectively, the document
must have an underlying logical structure and reading order. This
logical structure and reading order use behind-the-scenes elements
called tags, which a PDF author adds to the document. Tags define the
intended reading order of the content on each page. Screen readers rely
on these tags to present text in a way that makes sense when someone is
hearing the text read out loud. The tags allow a screen reader to
interpret page elements such as headings, sidebars, tables, and
multi-column text.</p>
<p><span id="Adobe_Reader_Accessibility_Featu"
class="anchor"></span>Adobe Reader Accessibility Features</p>
<p><strong>Alternate text descriptions for figures, form fields, and
links</strong> Authors of accessible PDF documents add descriptive
alternate text to page elements that are typically presented not as text
but only as visual elements, such as graphics, figures, form fields, and
links. When screen readers encounter alternate text, they can interpret
the element and read its alternate text description aloud.</p>
<p>Navigational aids</p>
<p>Similar to accessible Web pages, accessible PDF documents also
include navigational aids, such as links, bookmarks, a table of
contents, and an optimized tab order for forms and embedded links. These
navigational aids enable a user to go directly to a particular point in
a document, instead of reading it through page by page.</p>
<p><strong>Security that doesn’t interfere with assistive
technology</strong> When creating PDF documents, some authors add
restrictions to prevent users from printing, copying, extracting,
commenting, or editing text. These restrictions can interfere with a
screen reader’s ability to convert the on-screen text to speech. The
content of an <em>accessible</em> PDF document is available to screen
readers, regardless of the security restrictions in place.</p>
<p>Fonts that allow characters to be extracted to text</p>
<p>The fonts used in an accessible PDF document contain enough
information for Adobe Reader to correctly extract all of the characters
to text for purposes other than displaying text on the screen. For
example, Adobe Reader extracts characters to text any time you listen to
text by using a screen reader; print; copy and paste; or save text to a
file. If the font’s underlying information is sufficient, Adobe Reader
can extract each character correctly each time you perform one of these
tasks. If the information is insufficient, Adobe Reader cannot
substitute characters correctly, and the output will be incomplete. For
instance, the screen reader may omit words or characters, or you may see
question marks, black rectangles, or similar marks when you print, copy
and paste, or save a PDF document as text. If a PDF document contains
one or more fonts that do not contain enough information for Adobe
Reader to correctly extract all characters to text, the document is
considered inaccessible. <strong>Adobe Reader Accessibility
Features</strong></p>
<p>Adobe Reader is compatible with assistive technology, including
screen readers, and it offers several tools and features to enhance your
reading and viewing experience.</p>
<p>Using the Accessibility Setup Assistant</p>
<p>You can use the Accessibility Setup Assistant to control how Adobe
Reader displays documents and interacts with assistive technology,
including screen readers and screen magnifiers. The Accessibility Setup
Assistant automatically opens the first time that you run Adobe Reader
while a screen reader is running. Alternatively, you can start the
assistant by choosing Document &gt; Accessibility &gt; Setup Assistant
from the Adobe Reader menu, or by pressing Alt+D then T. The assistant
is a series of dialog boxes that you navigate as you would any standard
Windows dialog box, using the Arrow, Tab, Spacebar, and Enter keys.
Screen reader users will likely be familiar with the various
controls</p>
<p>Adobe Reader Accessibility Features</p>
<p>used, including radio buttons, check boxes, combo boxes, and buttons
labeled “Previous”, “Next”, and “Cancel”. The assistant also includes
static text that describes the controls and explains what they do.</p>
<p>Accessibility Setup Assistant, Screen 1 of 5</p>
<p>On the assistant’s first screen, you can choose whether you want to
set the options for screen readers, screen magnifiers, or both. There is
also a button on this screen labeled “Use recommended settings and skip
setup.” Select this option to use Adobe’s recommended settings for
accessibility.</p>
<p><img src="media/index-7_1.png" style="width:6.5in;height:6.45833in"

<p>Figure 1: Accessibility Setup Assistant First Screen</p>
<p>Adobe Reader Accessibility Features</p>
<p>If you choose instead to set your own screen reader preferences, the
following guidelines can help you select options tailored to your
specific needs.</p>
<p>Accessibility Setup Assistant, Screen 2 of 5</p>
<p>This screen is used to set preferences for text colors, text
smoothing, and other options not central to screen reader technology.
Click Next to proceed to screen 3.</p>
<p>Accessibility Setup Assistant, Screen 3 of 5</p>
<p>Use the third screen to choose the reading order for documents that
are not tagged. The following options are supported:</p>
<p>• Infer Reading Order From Document (Recommended). When this option
is selected, Adobe</p>
<p>Reader determines the reading order of untagged documents using an
advanced method of layout analysis. This option is recommended because
it is most likely to provide the most accurate results. It does,
however, require more analysis and therefore may be slower than the
other two options.</p>
<p>• Left-To-Right, Top-To-Bottom Reading Order. When this option is
selected,</p>
<p>Adobe Reader interprets the reading order of untagged documents
starting from left to right on the page and moving from top to
bottom.</p>
<p>• Use Reading Order In Raw Print Stream. When this option is
selected, Adobe Reader</p>
<p>interprets the reading order of untagged documents based on the raw
code in the PDF document – essentially, the order text was recorded in
the print stream.</p>
<p>When you choose either of the last two options, Adobe Reader does not
include form fields in the content, and it does not recognize
tables.</p>
<p>Depending on the complexity of the PDF document, on-the-fly tagging
may not adequately capture the intended reading order of the document.
Many PDF documents have multiple columns or complex page designs that
can affect how well Adobe Reader interprets the content. If you are
having trouble reading a particular PDF document, you can experiment
with the various Reading Order options to see if one works better than
the others.</p>
<p>The next control on this screen is a check box labeled “Override the
Reading Order in Tagged Documents.” While the Reading Order options
above apply to untagged documents by default, this option causes Adobe
Reader to use the reading order you selected (instead of using the
reading order specified by the tag structure) for tagged documents as
well. This option is useful if you receive PDF documents that are poorly
tagged. The final control on this screen is a check box labeled “Confirm
before Adding Tags to Document.” When you select this option, Adobe
Reader asks you to confirm its tagging options before it prepares an
untagged document for reading by your assistive technology. Tagging can
be a time-consuming procedure, particularly in larger documents, and
this option alerts screen reader users when that procedure is about to
begin.</p>
<p>Accessibility Setup Assistant, Screen 4 of 5</p>
<p>On the next screen, there is a set of three radio buttons used to
select the delivery method of pages for assistive technology. When Adobe
Reader delivers information to a screen reader, it loads</p>
<p>Adobe Reader Accessibility Features</p>
<p>information into a memory buffer that is directly available to the
assistive technology. The amount of information that is delivered to the
memory buffer can affect how quickly Adobe Reader performs tasks, such
as opening the document, turning pages, changing views, and carrying out
commands. The following options control how much information is
delivered at one time to your screen reader:</p>
<p>• Only Read the Currently Visible Pages. Select this option to load
information about</p>
<p>one page or a few pages at a time into the memory buffer of a screen
reader.</p>
<p>• Read The Entire Document At Once. Select this option to load the
entire document at one</p>
<p>time into the memory buffer of a screen reader. This is the best
option when you are using a screen reader to access short documents, but
it may take longer to open large documents.</p>
<p>• For Large Documents, Only Read the Currently Visible Pages. Choose
this option to have</p>
<p>Adobe Reader selectively switch between loading an entire document at
once into the memory buffer of a screen reader and loading one page at a
time into the buffer if the document exceeds a certain number of pages.
This is usually the best option if you are using a screen reader and you
have very long or complex PDF documents. It is the default setting for
Adobe Reader.</p>
<p>When you choose this third option, you can use the next edit field,
labeled “Minimum Number of Pages in a Large Document,” to set the page
number limit at which you want Adobe Reader to stop loading an entire
PDF document into the memory buffer for a screen reader. The default is
50 pages.</p>
<p>The next two controls are used to control how documents are
displayed, either one page at a time or able to scroll continuously.
Select the check box labeled “Override Page Layout Style” to have Adobe
Reader use the style selected in the combo box labeled “Page Layout”.
This setting controls how scrolling and Page Up and Page Down keystrokes
work. The recommended setting for screen readers is “Single Page.” The
final two controls on this screen are used to control the document zoom.
When the check box labeled “Override Document Zoom” is checked, Adobe
Reader overrides the zoom factor of the original document and uses the
one chosen in the combo box labeled Document Zoom. The “Fit Page” option
scales the page so that the entire page is visible in the window and
usually works best for screen readers.</p>
<p>Accessibility Setup Assistant, Screen 5 of 5</p>
<p>The first check box on the final Accessibility Setup Assistant screen
is labeled “Disable document auto-save.” Select this option to disable
the auto-save function. Each time a PDF document is auto-saved, the
screen reader or magnifier must reload the document. This box is checked
by default for better screen reader performance.</p>
<p>The next check box is labeled “Reopen documents to the last viewed
page.” When this box is checked, Adobe Reader will open a document to
the last page you were reading when it was last open, instead of the
first page of the document.</p>
<p>The final check box is labeled “Display PDF documents in the web
browser.” This option controls whether documents from the Internet open
in the web browser or in a separate Adobe Reader window. Screen reader
users will likely want to deselect this check box, which will cause
documents accessed via a web browser to be opened in a separate Adobe
Reader window. This provides greater control because not all screen
readers support reading PDF documents from within the browser.</p>
<p><span id="Adobe_Reader_Accessibility_Featu_4"
class="anchor"></span>Adobe Reader Accessibility Features</p>
<p>Note: The Accessibility Setup Assistant defaults are optimized for
your assistive</p>
<p>technology. When you run it while using your assistive technology for
the first time, and you select Use Recommended Settings and Skip Setup,
Adobe Reader is configured with the settings that are most appropriate
for use with that assistive technology. If, however, you select Cancel
at any time while the assistant runs for the first time alongside your
assistive technology, Adobe Reader uses the Adobe Reader defaults.
Because these defaults are not as fine-tuned for a specific screen
reader as those that the Accessibility Setup Assistant selects,
selecting Cancel during the first assistant run is not recommended.</p>
<p>If you start the Accessibility Setup Assistant manually from the
Document menu, the assistant uses the current values from the
Preferences dialog box as its defaults. These values also may not always
be optimal for your specific assistive technology. When running the
Accessibility Setup Assistant from manually, you should therefore review
the values and descriptions carefully and, if needed, change these
values to meet your specific needs.</p>
<p><strong>Changing accessibility settings with the Preferences dialog
box</strong> The settings found in the Accessibility Setup Assistant can
also be found in the Preferences dialog box, although some of these
settings have slightly different names. In addition to the assistant’s
settings that are most relevant to screen readers and magnifiers, the
Preferences dialog box also has accessibility preferences that assist
people with other disabilities. When you use the assistant or the
Preferences dialog box to adjust a setting, the changes you make
override any changes made previously with either assistant or the
Preferences dialog box.</p>
<p>There are accessibility settings in the Preferences dialog that are
not found in the Accessibility Setup Assistant. Multimedia preference
settings, for example control how a media player presents any subtitles,
audio dubbing, or other accessibility features that are part of any
audio or video files attached to Adobe PDF document. Of particular
interest to screen reader users is a check box labeled “Show audio
description (or video description, or descriptive video) when
available”. When this option is selected, your multimedia player will
play any audio or video descriptions that the author may have included
in the multimedia presentation.</p>
<p>Adobe Reader Accessibility Features</p>
<p>You can access the Preferences dialog box by choosing Edit &gt;
Preferences. Press Alt+E and then N, or use the shortcut Ctrl+K. The
dialog box is divided into two sections. The section on the left is a
list of categories of preferences. The section on the right is a panel
that contains the options that you can modify for the selected category.
The first time that you open the Preferences dialog box, focus is on the
Accessibility category. Thereafter, focus is on the category that you
most recently selected. To select a category, you can use the Up Arrow
and Down Arrow keys, or press the letter key that corresponds to the
first letter of the category name.</p>
<p><img src="media/index-11_1.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.33333in"
alt="index-11_1.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: Accessibility Preferences Dialog</p>
<p>Use the following tips for navigating the Preferences dialog with the
keyboard:</p>
<p>• To move focus from the category list to the panel of options, press
Tab.</p>
<p>• To move focus to the next option in the panel, press Tab.</p>
<p>• To move focus to the previous option in the panel, press
Shift+Tab.</p>
<p><span id="Adobe_Reader_Accessibility_Featu_6"
class="anchor"></span>Adobe Reader Accessibility Features</p>
<p>• To bring focus to items in sublists, use the Up Arrow, Down Arrow,
Right Arrow, and Left Arrow keys. • To select or deselect an option that
has focus, press the Spacebar.</p>
<p>The following Preferences categories are useful to screen reader
users:</p>
<p>• Accessibility — for setting tab order to follow the document’s
structure • General — for disabling the auto-save function to speed
performance • Internet — for controlling how Adobe Reader opens in a
browser • Multimedia — for controlling how multimedia players play
back</p>
<p>accessibility information that is embedded in audio and video</p>
<p>• Page Display — for setting default zoom levels and setting default
page layout displays • Reading — for choosing the delivery method of
pages that are sent to a screen reader • Startup — for reopening
documents to the last-viewed page</p>
<p>Note: The Reading category contains three sections labeled “Reading
Order</p>
<p>Options”, “Screen Reader Options”, and “Read Out Loud Options.” While
the first two sections are relevant to screen readers, the last section
is not. The settings in “Read Out Loud Options” control the Read Aloud
feature of Adobe Reader. This feature reads aloud the text of a PDF
document, but does not provide the same level of reading functionality
as an advanced screen reader. Although it is not intended to replace
screen reader technology, it can be helpful when no screen reader is
available. It is also a valuable tool for people with dyslexia or
another print disability.</p>
<p>Saving an Adobe PDF document as text</p>
<p>Adobe Reader provides the ability to extract the text of an Adobe PDF
document and save it as a text file. This is useful if you want to read
the document on a note-taker or emboss the file with a Braille printer.
A text version of a PDF document contains no images or multimedia
objects, but it does contain alternate descriptions for images if the
author provided them. To access the “Save as text” dialog box, choose
File &gt; Save as text or press Alt+F and then press V.</p>
<p>For best results when saving text for use with alternative
translation technologies, first choose the Reading Order preference that
best reflects the appropriate reading order of the document.</p>
<p>For instructions, se<a href="#Adobe_Reader_Accessibility_Featu">e
“Using the Accessibility Setup Assistant” e</a>arlier in this guide.</p>
<p>Note: If your screen reader does not read the saved text file in the
most logical</p>
<p>order, the PDF document may not be adequately tagged and
structured.</p>
<p><strong>Navigating PDF documents with keyboard alternatives to mouse
actions</strong> Nearly all actions that can be performed with a mouse
in Adobe Reader can also be performed using keystrokes. The Adobe Reader
interface should be familiar to anyone who has experience working with
standard Windows applications, such as word processors or web browsers.
The menu bar is accessed by pressing the Alt key,</p>
<p><span id="Types_of_PDF_Documents" class="anchor"></span>Types of PDF
Documents</p>
<p>and there are keyboard shortcuts for many actions. Each of the
sections on JAWS and Window-Eyes in this guide provides information on
keystrokes specific to that screen reader. More information on Adobe
Reader</p>
<p>keyboard shortcuts is available a<a
href="http://www.adobe.com/enterprise/accessibility/reader/appx_a.html">t
http://www.adobe.com/enterprise/accessibility/reader/appx_a.html.</a></p>
<p>The following keystrokes are helpful for getting started with PDF
documents:</p>
<p>• Ctrl+Page Down or Ctrl+Page Up -- Go to the next or previous
page</p>
<p>• Shift+Ctrl+Page Down or Shift+Ctrl+Page Up -- Go to the bottom or
top of the document</p>
<p>• Ctrl+K -- Open the Preferences dialog box</p>
<p>• Ctrl+D -- Display document properties, including security</p>
<p>settings and tagged status that affect accessibility</p>
<p>• Shift+Ctrl+6 -- Start Accessibility Quick Check</p>
<p>• ALT + F and then V -- Save to text</p>
<p>• ALT-D and then T -- Start Accessibility Setup Assistant</p>
<p>• F5 -- Place focus on document</p>
<p>Automatically tagging untagged documents</p>
<p>When you open a PDF document that is not tagged, Adobe Reader
analyzes the document and automatically adds tags to improve the reading
order. These tags are only temporary, and must be added each time the
PDF document is opened. When you open an untagged PDF, Adobe Reader asks
you to choose one of three reading order options. This dialog box
explains that your screen reader will not be able to interact with Adobe
Reader during the tagging process, and it provides the number of pages
in the document to give you an idea of how long the tagging will take.
<strong>Types of PDF Documents</strong></p>
<p>Though PDF is a standard, the content and structure of PDF documents
vary widely. This section describes how accessibility is affected by
four types of PDF documents: image only files, untagged documents,
tagged documents, and electronic forms.</p>
<p>Image only files</p>
<p>Image only PDF files present significant accessibility barriers for
screen reader users. These files are inaccessible because they contain
only graphic images representing each page instead of actual text
characters. Although text may appear on the screen, it is only a picture
of text without the underlying characters needed by a screen reader
Image only PDF files are created when a user scans a paper document,
producing an image of the document. The scanning process is similar to
how a blind person uses a scanner along with optical character
recognition (OCR) software to read print materials. However, because OCR
has not been performed on the document, the result is an image only
file. Although authors can use Adobe Acrobat to perform OCR when
creating PDF documents, many skip the OCR process because it takes more
time than simply distributing the document as it appears in the document
window. Another reason that authors may skip OCR is that, depending on
the quality of the image, the resulting text can contain recognition
errors, which require manual proofreading to resolve.</p>
<p><span id="Types_of_PDF_Documents_1" class="anchor"></span>Types of
PDF Documents</p>
<p>Before your screen reader can access an image only PDF document, you
need to convert the image into accessible text. You can use any
application with built-in OCR functionality, including Adobe Acrobat.
You can also use certain third party OCR software applications, which
have built-in tools to recognize PDF files. Even with the best OCR
technology available, the result may not be perfect. If none of these
tools are available, or if you cannot prevail upon the original author
to correct the situation, you may need to obtain sighted assistance to
have the document read to you.</p>
<p>Untagged documents</p>
<p>PDF documents often contain page layouts with multiple columns,
sidebars, and captions for photos. As a result, even when a PDF contains
actual text instead of images only, it may be inaccessible because of
problems in determining the most appropriate reading order. A screen
reader might not be able to extract words, sentences and paragraphs in a
coherent order. Instead, they may be mixed together in disconnected,
confusing ways. For example, when the text of a PDF file is arranged in
columns like in a newspaper, the structure of the document is apparent
visually, because extra spacing or border lines indicates where one
column of text ends and another begins. Screen readers, however, cannot
always detect these visual cues. In these cases, information about the
document structure must be included in the PDF file for a screen reader
to present a document in an intelligible manner. Without structural
information that groups and separates regions of the page, the document
may be inaccessible to screen reader users.</p>
<p>PDF <em>tags</em> are used to address such accessibility problems.
PDF tags are similar to tags used in HTML to make Web pages more
accessible. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) did pioneering work with
HTML tags to incorporate the document structure that was needed for
accessibility as the HTML standard evolved. For example, a phrase may be
tagged as the heading of a section, the caption of an image, or a cell
within a table. Some tags are necessary for proper visual display in a
web browser, but other tags are recommended specifically to aid
accessibility. Accessibility tags may include an indication of the row
and column labels of a table, which enables a screen reader to tell the
user about the context of each cell. The cell information may be useless
or confusing without knowing the associated row and column labels. When
authors fail to use tags to indicate the internal structure of the
document, the PDF documents they create are <em>untagged</em>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you will likely encounter many untagged PDF documents,
making it difficult for your screen reader to make sense of the
document.</p>
<p>Automatic tagging helps alleviate the problems caused by untagged PDF
documents. Adobe Reader can analyze an untagged PDF file and add
temporary tags to optimize its reading order for screen readers.</p>
<p>When you open an untagged PDF, Adobe Reader presents a dialog box
that allows you to choose the type of tagging you want it to perform on
the document. The tagging process can take a few minutes for large
files, so your screen reader will alert you that the document is being
processed while it is being tagged. When the tagging is complete, your
screen reader will begin reading the document. The file is only tagged
temporarily -- because the tags are not saved, the process will have to
be repeated if you open the document again.</p>

PDF Documents</p>

<p>Figure 3: Reading Untagged Document Dialog</p>
<p>Assistive technology such as JAWS and Window-Eyes screen readers
interpret the PDF tags in files viewed in Adobe Reader (or Acrobat). As
a result these screen readers can render more accessible output in
speech or Braille.</p>
<p>Tagged documents</p>
<p>Tagged documents provide the best reading experience for screen
reader users.</p>
<p>Like tags in HTML that improve accessibility of Web pages, PDF tags
convey a suggested reading order, allowing a screen reader to present
the document in an intelligible manner. Tags mark portions of PDF
content and are organized in sequence. When a PDF document has been
properly tagged by</p>
<p><span id="Using_Adobe_Reader_with_JAWS" class="anchor"></span>Using
Adobe Reader with JAWS</p>
<p>its author, screen readers do a better job of interpreting the
document’s structure, which also makes it easier to use your screen
reader’s keystroke commands to navigate and read the document.</p>
<p>Adobe Acrobat is the most popular software for creating PDF
documents; and it includes a feature that analyzes the accessibility of
a PDF file. It reports potential problems, including ambiguous structure
and unlabeled pictures. Acrobat can also automatically add tags when the
document’s content makes it clear which tags are appropriate. Some
tagging, however, must be done manually. You can use Acrobat to produce
an accessibility report that identifies potential problems, and then
correct these problems by selecting a portion of the document and
selecting a tag to indicate its purpose. For example, Adobe Acrobat
cannot tell what a picture contains, so you need to enter a caption tag
for the picture manually. The manual tagging process can take some time,
depending on the complexity of the document. For more online resources
that make it easier to design accessible</p>

<p>Electronic forms</p>
<p>Electronic forms are an increasingly popular use of PDF. Although
some PDF forms are simply documents that are to be printed and filled
out by hand, many can be filled out electronically using your computer
and screen reader. These forms are similar to HTML forms you may
encounter on the Internet, and they have many of the same accessibility
issues. A simple PDF form may ask for basic information such as your
name and address. More complex PDF forms can gather significantly more
information. You can use an IRS form, for example, to enter income, tax
withholdings, marital status, and the number of children you have.</p>
<p>Like any PDF document, forms must have a logical structure with
proper tagging to be accessible for screen readers. In addition to
establishing a proper read order, PDF forms must have a logical tab
order defined. When filling out these forms, users move from one entry
field to another by pressing the Tab key. If the fields are tagged with
improper labels, it is nearly impossible for a screen reader user to
know what to enter in each field. <strong>Using Adobe Reader with
JAWS</strong></p>
<p>JAWS for Windows, made by Freedom Scientific, works with Adobe Reader
to read PDF documents. JAWS can also read other types of documents in a
word processor or on the Internet. Typically, you read PDF documents
using the virtual PC cursor, just as you would when using Internet
Explorer. This user guide was written for JAWS version 7.0 and
above.</p>
<p>Overview of JAWS support for Adobe Reader</p>
<p>The JAWS built-in Help system provides extensive guidance for using
Adobe Reader, including a short overview, links to other resources, and
the following topics:</p>
<p>• JAWS Commands for using Reader</p>
<p>• Reader Getting Started</p>
<p>• Helpful Hints</p>
<p>You can access this information in two ways.</p>
<p>1. If you are using Adobe Reader, you can simply hold down the Insert
key and press F1 twice rapidly. This</p>
<p>will open the tree view of JAWS Help Topics with your cursor
positioned on the Adobe Acrobat and Reader topic. Press Enter, and then
F6, to open a page with all the JAWS Adobe Help information and

<p>With JAWS, use the PC cursor to access the various controls used in
the Accessibility Setup Assistant, including radio buttons, check boxes,
combo boxes and buttons. Each screen also includes static text that
describes the controls and explains what they do. JAWS reads that static
text as each screen opens, and you can use the JAWS cursor to reread the
information.</p>
<p>Accessibility Setup Assistant notes for Window-Eyes users</p>
<p>The Window-Eyes cursor can access the various controls used in the
Accessibility Setup Assistant, including radio buttons, check boxes,
combo boxes and buttons. Each screen also includes static text that
describes the controls and explains what they do. Window-Eyes does not
automatically read this static text, but you can use the Mouse cursor to
read it.</p>
<p>The Preferences dialog box</p>
<p>The settings found in the Accessibility Setup Assistant can also be
found in the Preferences dialog box (although some settings are under
slightly different names). To access the Preferences dialog box, choose
Edit &gt; Preferences or press Alt+E and then N. You can also use the
shortcut Ctrl+K. For more information on setting options using</p>
<p>the Preferences dialog box se<a
href="#Adobe_Reader_Accessibility_Featu_4">e “Changing accessibility
settings with the Preferences dialog box</a>” earlier in this guide.</p>
<p>Opening PDF documents</p>
<p>Opening a PDF document is no different than opening other types of
documents you may encounter using a PC. With Adobe Reader, choose File
&gt; Open or press Alt+F and then O. You can use the shortcut Ctrl+O as
well. You can also open PDF documents by navigating to them with Windows
Explorer and pressing the Enter key when your PC cursor is on the
desired document.</p>
<p>The remainder of this section describes how to use your screen reader
to read and interact with four common types of PDF documents: image only
files, untagged documents, tagged documents, and electronic</p>
<p>forms. For more detailed information on these types se<a
href="#Types_of_PDF_Documents">e “Types of PDF Documents” e</a>arlier in
this guide.</p>
<p>The Accessibility Setup Assistant</p>
<p>Opening image only documents</p>
<p>Most image only documents are created by authors who placed a printed
page through a scanner and saved the resulting image as a PDF document.
Although text may appear on the screen, it is only a picture of text
without the underlying characters needed by JAWS.</p>
<p>When you open an image only file, Adobe Reader treats it as an
untagged document, and presents the dialog to start the tagging process.
Even after tagging the file will still be inaccessible to screen
readers.</p>
<p><strong>Note for JAWS and Window-Eyes users regarding image only
documents:</strong> When Adobe Reader completes the tagging process, the
image of the file appears, and JAWS and Window-Eyes will report, “Alert,
empty document.” Your screen reader will not be able to read anything in
the file, and all keystroke navigation attempts will result in the same
message, “Alert, empty document.”</p>
<p>If you need access to the information in an image only PDF, you can
use the PDF recognition features found in certain brands of Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) software. You can also use the OCR features
of Adobe Acrobat Standard or Professional to convert an image file to
readable text. The quality of the results produced by any OCR tool will
vary depending on the complexity of the original document and the
clarity of the image. In some cases, you may need sighted assistance to
read image only documents.</p>
<p>Opening untagged documents</p>
<p>When you open an untagged PDF document using a screen reader, a
dialog box appears to notify you that the document is untagged and must
be prepared for reading. The notification includes a reminder that
assistive technology will not be able to interact while the document is
being analyzed and tagged. Additionally, the number of pages in the
document is provided, so you can estimate the relative duration of the
tagging process. After this introductory information, your screen reader
will inform you that you are in a combo box for choosing the reading
order, and that you are on the first of three choices. The recommended
option, labeled “Infer reading order from document,” works best for most
documents. For some documents, however, you may find that one of the
other choices works better. The other choices are “Left-to-right,
top-to-bottom reading order”, and “Use reading order in raw print
stream”. You can use the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys to select one of
these options.</p>
<p>The Accessibility Setup Assistant</p>
<p>The next set of options, labeled “Reading Mode Options”, controls how
much information is delivered at once to your screen reader. For large
documents, select the radio button labeled “Read the Currently Visible
Pages only.” This option loads information from a few pages at a time
into the memory buffer of the screen reader. The second option is
labeled “Read the Entire Document At Once”. This is usually the best
option when you are using a screen reader, but it may affect performance
when you read large documents.</p>
<p><img src="media/index-24_1.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.44444in"
alt="index-24_1.png" /></p>
<p>Figure 4: Specifying Reading the Currently Visible Pages</p>
<p>After choosing your settings, tab to the Start button, and press the
Enter key to begin the tagging process. The time required to tag a
document depends on the length and complexity of the document, but the
process often finishes within a few seconds.</p>
<p>Automatic tagging is designed to enable screen readers to better
interpret untagged PDF documents. Depending on the complexity of the PDF
document, however, this tagging may not fully capture the intended
reading order of the document. Many PDF documents have multiple columns,
sidebars, or</p>
<p>The Accessibility Setup Assistant</p>
<p>complex page designs that can affect how well Adobe Reader interprets
the content. If you are having trouble reading particular PDF documents,
you can experiment with the other Reading Order options.</p>
<p><strong>Note for JAWS users regarding untagged documents:</strong>
During the tagging process, JAWS periodically announces the percentage
of the process that has been completed. In addition, Adobe Reader
displays a dialog box, readable with the JAWS cursor, which shows the
number of pages that have been tagged along with the total number of
pages in the document.</p>
<p><strong>Note for Window-Eyes users regarding untagged
documents:</strong> During the tagging process, a dialog box appears
showing the number of pages that have been tagged along with the total
number of pages in the document. This dialog box is readable with the
Window-Eyes mouse cursor. To have Window-Eyes read the current status of
the process as reported by the progress bar, press Ctrl+Insert+B.</p>
<p>Opening tagged documents</p>
<p>When you open a tagged document you can begin reading immediately.
Because there is no need for Adobe Reader to tag the document itself, it
does not present the tagging dialog box. Properly tagged documents offer
the best reading experience for screen reader users, providing many ways
to access all of the elements in a PDF document.</p>
<p>Tagged documents that have not been tagged correctly might not be
read properly by screen readers. With these documents, it may help to
change the reading order. To do this, press Ctrl+K to bring up the
Preferences dialog box, and then press R to access the Reading controls.
Press tab to navigate the combo box labeled “Reading Order.” Use the Up
and Down Arrows to select on of the three reading order options, and
then press Enter.</p>
<p>Tagged documents enable better control for interacting with various
elements within PDF documents, including tables, headings, links, lists,
paragraphs, and graphics. You can use the following tips to work with
these elements:</p>
<p><strong>Tables</strong>: When a properly tagged PDF document includes
tables, you can use the same commands for navigating and reading tables
that are used with Microsoft Word documents and web pages in a browser.
All the row and column headings are accessible, and you can move quickly
from table to table by pressing T or Shift+T.</p>
<p>With Window-Eyes, enter “Table Mode” by pressing Ctrl+NUM PAD PLUS
and then use your Window-Eyes table navigation keys (Insert+Arrow) to
read the information in the table. Press Ctrl+NUM PAD MINUS to exit
Table Mode.</p>
<p><strong>Headings</strong>: When the headings for various sections of
a PDF are properly tagged, you can quickly move among the various
sections. Press H or Shift+H to move back or forward from heading to
heading.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong>: A PDF file may include links to other
sections of the document or to web pages on the Internet. JAWS and
Window-Eyes will read the names of links that have been properly tagged.
With JAWS, Press Insert+F7 to place all the links into a list that you
can navigate using Arrow keys. If you know the first letter of the link
you are looking for, you can press the first letter of the link to
quickly</p>
<p><span id="The_Accessibility_Setup_Assistan_4"
class="anchor"></span>The Accessibility Setup Assistant</p>
<p>move to links in the list that begin with that letter. After
selecting a link, press Enter to follow it. Press Tab and Shift+Tab to
move back and forth between the links in a document when using JAWS.</p>
<p>With Window-Eyes, press L or Shift+L to move back and forth between
the links in a document.</p>
<p><strong>Lists</strong>: With JAWS, press L or Shift+L to move between
tagged lists in a PDF document.</p>
<p>With Window-Eyes, you can move between the various lists by pressing
S or Shift+S. You can then use the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys to read
the various list items. Alternatively, you can also press I or Shift+I
to move back and forth between the list items.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraphs</strong>: To move between tagged paragraphs in a
PDF document press P or Shift+P. <strong>Graphics</strong>: JAWS and
Window-Eyes will read descriptions of all properly tagged images in a
PDF document.</p>
<p>With JAWS, press G or Shift+G to move between graphics.</p>
<p>The Window-Eyes Page Navigation Dialog Box</p>
<p>With Window-Eyes you can use the Page Navigation Dialog Box to
quickly find and move among many of the various elements of a properly
tagged PDF document. Press Insert+Tab to open this dialog. The focus is
in a list of one of the particular elements found in the document. Press
Shift+Tab to move focus to a group box control used to choose the type
of element you would like to find. For example, to navigate to a
particular link use the Arrow keys to select “Links”, and then press Tab
to move to the list of links that are in the PDF document. Then use the
Arrow keys to find the link you want. Alternatively, if you know the
name of the link, you can press the first letter of the link and move
directly to that link in the list. If there is more than one link
starting with that letter, you may have to press the letter more than
once to find the link you want. When you find your link, press Enter and
you will be taken to the target of that link in the body of the PDF
document. If you don’t want to activate the link, but simply want to
move to its location within the document, you can tab to the button
labeled “Move to”, which closes the dialog and places focus on the link.
You can also move to other elements, including headings, lists, forms,
and tables.</p>
<p>Note: You must use the Adobe Reader option “Read the Entire Document
At</p>
<p>Once” for all the elements to appear in this dialog box. If you have
set this option to “Read the Currently Visible Pages only,” then only
the elements in the currently visible page will appear. You can change
this setting with</p>
<p>the Adobe Reader Preferences dialog box <a
href="#Adobe_Reader_Accessibility_Featu_4">(see Changing accessibility
settings</a></p>
<p><a href="#Adobe_Reader_Accessibility_Featu_4">with the Preferences
dialog box</a> earlier is this guide).</p>
<p>Opening forms</p>
<p>Properly tagged electronic forms are accessible. Your screen reader
will speak all the information you need to successfully fill-out the
entire form.</p>
<p>For example, when you encounter a tagged edit box for entering your
name, your screen reader might say “Enter your first name,” so you know
what to type in the field. Other types of fields you may encounter in a
form include combo boxes, buttons, radio buttons, and check boxes. Press
Tab and Shift+Tab to move</p>
<p><span id="The_Accessibility_Setup_Assistan_5"
class="anchor"></span>The Accessibility Setup Assistant</p>
<p>back and forth between form fields. The Up and Down Arrow keys move
focus between combo box and radio button choices, and Enter activates
buttons. Press the Spacebar to select or deselect a check box.</p>
<p><strong>Notes for JAWS and Window-Eyes users regarding
forms:</strong> Press F to move to the next form in a document, and
press Enter to enter forms mode so you can begin filling out the
form.</p>
<p>Using Adobe Reader Help</p>
<p>To access help in Adobe Reader 8 Help, choose Help &gt; Adobe Reader
8 Help, or press Alt+H and then H. You can also simply press F1 to open
the Adobe Help Viewer window, which you navigate as you would an HTML
document. The Help Viewer has a navigation frame and a contents frame.
The information and links in the contents frame changes when you make
selections in the navigation frame. As with other help systems you may
be familiar with, there are three ways to find information in the Adobe
Help Viewer. There is a Contents page, an Index page, and a Search page.
Adobe Reader 8 Help opens by default to the Contents page; and there are
links at the top to select the Index or Search pages.</p>
<p>Note: the Contents page should not be confused with the contents
frame.</p>
<p>You can browse through the Contents page just as you would any HTML
page using standard HTML navigation techniques for your screen reader.
Use the navigation frame to find links of interest and press Enter when
you find one. With JAWS and Window-Eyes, you can then quickly move
through the information in the contents frame by pressing H for
headings.</p>
<p>The Index page presents individual Help topics that are available.
This page presents a list of all the letters of the alphabet in the
navigation frame, and you can press Enter on any letter to bring up the
topics that begin with that letter. The list of topics is presented in a
tree view. Visually, a plus sign indicates an item that is “expandable”,
and a minus sign indicates an item that has been expanded with its
subtopics below. An item without any sub-topics has no plus or minus
sign, indicating visually that it is an actual help topic.</p>
<p>The Search page of Adobe Reader 8 Help enables you to locate help
topics related to a word or phrase.</p>
<p>One of the main topics in Adobe Reader 8 Help is “Accessibility,
tags, and reflow.” This topics offers assistance on accessibility
features in Adobe Reader.</p>
<p>To access Adobe’s online Accessibility Resource Center choose Help
&gt; Online Support &gt; Accessibility Resource Center or press Alt+H,
followed by O and then R.</p>
<p>Adobe Reader help notes for JAWS users</p>
<p>For JAWS users, the tree view on the Index page presents a challenge,
because there is no easy way to distinguish a tree element with a plus
or minus sign (indicating subtopics below) from a tree element that
represents an actual help topic.</p>
<p><span id="The_Accessibility_Setup_Assistan_6"
class="anchor"></span>The Accessibility Setup Assistant</p>
<p>When you press Enter on a topic with a plus sign, the list of
subtopics is expanded beneath it. When you press Enter on a topic with a
minus sign, the list contracts. When you press enter on a topic with no
plus or minus sign, the help topic is displayed in the contents
frame.</p>
<p>You can use this workaround: press Enter on an item in the tree view;
if its related Help information does not appear in the contents frame,
then you will that this item has subtopics, and you should now find its
subtopics below it in the tree view.</p>
<p>The Search page is accessible using JAWS. To search for help on a
particular topic on the Search page, press F to navigate to the Search
edit field. Press Enter to start “forms mode” and then type in a search
term. Press Enter again to exit “forms mode”. A list of links will
appear in the navigation frame that relate to your search term.</p>
<p>Although most JAWS HTML navigation techniques work in the Adobe
Reader Help system, you cannot use the Ctrl+F JAWS Find command to
locate specific strings of text. JAWS will report that the string was
not found, even when the string does actually appear on the page. To
find specific strings of text in the Adobe Help Viewer use the JAWS
virtual Find command, Insert+Ctrl+F. Pressing the H key to move to the
next heading is a useful technique when using the Adobe Help Viewer. You
can press H to jump to the first heading in the contents frame where you
can read the currently displayed Help information.</p>
<p>Adobe Reader help notes for Window-Eyes users</p>
<p>Pressing the H key to move to the next heading is a useful technique
when using the Adobe Help Viewer. Press H to jump to the first heading
in the contents frame where you can read the currently displayed Help
information. The Insert+Tab command to place all the links in a list can
also be helpful.</p>
<p>When you select a link on the contents page, the dynamic contents of
the Adobe help system can cause a problem as Window-Eyes updates pages.
After selecting a link, if you try to read the new page, you may find
that the page has not changed, or you may hear “Loading Page.” In either
of these situations occurs, you can ask Window-Eyes to redraw the screen
by pressing Insert+Backslash. This command will usually correct the
problem and allow you to read the information on the new page. It may be
necessary to issue this command each time you follow a link.</p>
<p>Window-Eyes does not read the help text when on the index page. When
you choose a link after choosing a letter, the help text associated with
that topic is ignored by Window-Eyes. The contents frame often appears
empty. Because of this issue, you may want to avoid using the index
page. On the search page, you may find it necessary to have Window-Eyes
redraw the search screen. To do this, press Insert+Backslash.</p>
<p>Saving a PDF document as text</p>
<p>Adobe Reader provides the ability to extract the text of an Adobe PDF
document and save it as a text file. This feature is particularly useful
when you want to read the document on a note-taker or emboss</p>
<p><span id="The_Accessibility_Setup_Assistan_7"
class="anchor"></span>The Accessibility Setup Assistant</p>
<p>the file with a Braille printer. A text version of a PDF document
contains no images or multimedia objects, but it will contain alternate
descriptions for images if the author provided them. To save a file as
text, choose File &gt; Save as Text or press Alt+F and then V. This
brings up a standard Windows “Save As” dialog, and you can use Tab and
Shift+Tab to move back and forth between the various controls. You use
this dialog to name the file and specify where you want to save the file
on your computer.</p>
<p>For best results when saving text for use with alternative
translation technologies, first choose the Reading Order preference that
best reflects the appropriate reading order of the document. For
instructions on changing</p>
<p>the reading order, se<a href="#Adobe_Reader_Accessibility_Featu_4">e
“Changing accessibility settings with the Preferences dialog box”
e</a>arlier in this guide.</p>
<p>Note: If the text file that has been saved does not read in the most
logical order,</p>
<p>the PDF document may not be adequately tagged and structured.</p>
<p>Using the Adobe Reader Find and Search tools</p>
<p>Often, you want to find a specific piece of information in a PDF
document rather than reading it straight through from beginning to end.
To facilitate this, Adobe Reader provides a Find tool and a Search tool
to search for specific strings of text in a PDF document. Ctrl+F is the
shortcut to access the Adobe Find tool. Alternatively, you can select
Edit &gt; Find or press Alt+E and then F. The cursor is now in an edit
field and you are ready to type the string of text you want to find.
After you have finished typing your text string press the Enter key, and
then press F6 to return focus to the PDF document. The document will be
positioned to the page on which the first occurrence of your text string
appears. Depending on how the document was tagged, the cursor may not be
placed exactly on the actual text string. The Adobe Find tool places the
cursor in the tagged element (for example, the page, paragraph, table,
or heading) in which the text string was found, so you may need to
scroll to find your actual text string. Sometimes, especially with
untagged or poorly tagged documents, an element might be an entire page,
and it can take some time to find the text you want.</p>
<p>The Adobe Reader Search tool is a more powerful global search tool
that you can use to find text not only in the current document, but also
in all the PDF documents on your computer. The Search dialog has several
controls you can use to refine your search.</p>
<p>To access the search tool, choose Edit &gt; Search or press Alt+E and
then S. You can also press Shift+Ctrl+F to bring up the Adobe Search
dialog box. To search in the current PDF document only, you simply type
in the word or phrase you are searching for and press the Enter key. A
tree view will appear listing all <em>hits</em>, or occurrences of the
search string in the document. The text surrounding your search string
is included in the list. Use the Arrow keys to select the search hit you
want. When you press Enter the document will be positioned to the page
of that hit. However, as with the Adobe Find tool, you may need to
scroll on the page to find your search term. If the hit you chose was
not the one you wanted, you can press Alt+Tab to return to your list of
hits and try another one. When you are finished, press Alt+F4 to close
the Search window. If you want to search through several PDF documents
at once, press Tab after typing in your search terms. Select the radio
button labeled “All PDF Documents in” using the Arrow keys. Then, tab to
the next control to</p>
<p><span id="The_Accessibility_Setup_Assistan_8"
class="anchor"></span>The Accessibility Setup Assistant</p>
<p>choose a drive or folder on your computer in which to search. Then
press Shift+Tab three times to move back to the edit field, type your
search terms, and press Enter. It may take a while to display your hits,
depending on how many documents are located in the search. The tree view
that appears shows each document in which your search terms are found,
followed by each hit for each document. Although you can scroll through
all the various hits just like when searching through a single document,
your screen reader might not announce the names of the various
documents. As a result, you can choose from the various hits, but you
won’t know which document you are choosing until you actually press
Enter on the hit and open the document.</p>
<p>Adobe Reader find and search notes for JAWS users</p>
<p>In addition to the Adobe Reader Find and Search tools, the JAWS
Virtual Find feature can also be used to find text in a PDF
document.</p>
<p>You can use the JAWS Virtual Find tool after using the Adobe Find
tool. This tool finds text that appears on the current page only, and it
places your cursor on the exact text string it finds. Insert+Ctrl+F
brings up the JAWS Virtual Find tool and places the cursor in an edit
field. Type your search string and press Enter. The PC Cursor will be
place at the beginning of the next occurrence of that string on the
current page.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Reader find and search notes for Window-Eyes
users</strong> In addition to the Adobe Reader Find and Search tools,
the Window-Eyes Mouse Find tool can also be used to find text in a PDF
document.</p>
<p>You can use the Window-Eyes Mouse Find tool after using the Adobe
Find tool. This tool finds text that appears on the current page only,
and it places your cursor on the exact text string it finds.
Shift+Ctrl+F brings up the Window-Eyes Virtual Find tool and places the
cursor in an edit field. Type your search string and press Enter. The
cursor will be placed on the next occurrence of that string on the
current page.</p>
<p>To repeat the same search, press Insert+F. Window-Eyes will
automatically find the next occurrence of the text string you previously
searched for.</p>
<p>Shift+Ctrl+F is the shortcut to open the Adobe Search dialog box. If,
however, you are using the default Window-Eyes keyboard layout, this
keystroke is already in use. To access the dialog box you can either
issue the Window-Eyes bypass key (Insert+B) or you can choose Edit &gt;
Search (press Alt+E and then S).</p>
<p>The Go To Page dialog box</p>
<p>You can use the Adobe Reader Go To Page dialog box to determine the
current page and the total number of pages in the document. Choose View
&gt; Go To &gt; Page or press Shift+Ctrl+N.</p>
