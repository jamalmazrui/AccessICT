A Guide to the Integrated Accessibility



Standards Regulation

Introduction

In 2005, the Ontario Government passed the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act to make Ontario accessible by 2025.

Accessibility standards have been created as part of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act. These standards are rules that businesses and organizations in Ontario need to follow to identify, remove and prevent barriers so that people with disabilities have more opportunities to participate in everyday life.

The Accessibility Standard for Customer Service was the first standard to become law.

The next four standards – Information and Communications, Employment, Transportation and Design of Public Spaces – have been combined under one regulation, the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation. This regulation is now law and the requirements currently in regulation are being phased in between 2011 and 2021.

Why Accessibility? It’s Just Good Business

 By 2031, over 6 million people in Ontario will be either living with a disability

or be 55 years of age and over, accounting for 40% of all income

 As boomers age, it is expected that they will drive society to meet their needs

and demands

 This is a huge demographic that cannot be ignored  By learning how to serve people with disabilities, businesses may attract

more customers, build customer loyalty and improve their services for

everyone

 With the aging population, consumers are increasingly represented by the

disability community

 Ontario businesses need to market to and develop products for people with

disabilities in order to compete and succeed

 But, beyond being good for business – it’s just the right thing to do Accessibility Benefits Everyone





Accessibility not only helps people with disabilities, it also benefits:  seniors



 families travelling with young children

 shoppers

 visitors with luggage

Affected Businesses and Organizations

The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation applies to all Ontario organizations that provide goods, services or facilities to the public or to other organizations and have at least one employee.

The regulation divides organizations into five categories.

 Government of Ontario and the Legislative Assembly  Large designated public sector organizations with 50+ employees  Small designated public sector organizations with 1- 49 employees  Large organizations (private and not-for-profit) with 50+ employees  Small organizations (private and not-for-profit) with 1-49 employees

An organization’s requirements and timelines for compliance depend on which of these classes it falls under.

How to Read this Guide

The guide is divided into several parts based on the parts of the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation.

 Part 1 General Requirements

 Part 2 Information and Communications Standard Requirements  Part 3 Employment Standard Requirements

 Part 4 Transportation Standard Requirements

 Part 4.1 Design of Public Spaces Standard Requirements

It is recommended that all organizations read Parts 1 (General Requirements), 2 (Information and Communications Standard), 3 (Employment Standard) and 4.1 (Design of Public Spaces Standard). Part 4 (Transportation Standard) only applies to organizations providing transportation services.



Each part is divided into sections matching the section number in the regulation. Each section is a requirement of the regulation. In some cases a section addresses an exemption to certain organizations (e.g., Part 1, section 8). In others it provides information relevant to the regulation (e.g., Part 1, section 1).



The guide also includes a Glossary (Appendix A).

This guide is intended to be read as a companion to, and in conjunction with, the

Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation (Ontario Regulation 191/11). [NOTE: updated link to IASR required]





Part 1 – General Requirements



Overview

The General Requirements are those regulatory requirements that apply across all standards in this regulation – Information and Communications, Employment, Transportation and Design of Public Spaces.

Part 1 includes eight sections:

1. Purpose and application of the regulation

2. Definitions

3. Establishment of accessibility policies

4. Accessibility plans

5. Procuring or acquiring goods, services or facilities

6. Self-service kiosks

7. Training

8. Exemption from filing accessibility reports



In addition to the definitions found in Section 2, a Glossary (Appendix A) is also provided that includes all definitions found in the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation, as well as other useful explanations and definitions of terms related to accessibility.

Accessibility benefits everyone. Planning ahead and making accessibility a part of the way organizations do their daily business may tap into opportunities to attract more customers, build customer loyalty and improve services.





Section 1



Purpose of the Regulation

Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation

The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation establishes accessibility standards and introduces requirements for Information and Communications, Employment, Transportation and the Design of Public Spaces. The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation also establishes the compliance framework for obligated organizations.

The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation applies to all public, private and not-for-profit organizations, with at least one employee.

Ontario Human Rights Code

Organizations have current and ongoing obligations under the Ontario Human Rights Code respecting non-discrimination. The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation does not replace or affect existing legal obligations under the Ontario Human Rights Code and other laws in respect to accommodation of people with disabilities. Organizations must comply with both pieces of legislation.

The Ontario Human Rights Code and the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) both deal with accessibility, but are two very different pieces of legislation. The Ontario Human Rights Code is an individual, complaints-based legislation that addresses discrimination. The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation, created under the AODA, applies to all organizations in Ontario and will increase accessibility for all.

The Ontario Human Rights Code requires organizations to accommodate people with disabilities to the point of undue hardship.

The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation does not replace or affect legal rights or obligations that arise under the Ontario Human Rights Code and other laws relating to the accommodation of people with disabilities. This means that the Ontario Human Rights Code or other applicable legislation may require additional accommodation measures that go beyond or are different from the standards established by the regulations of the AODA.





Section 2

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ January 1, 2014 employees

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 1-49 January 1, 2015 employees



Implementing the Requirement

Statement of Commitment

All public sector organizations, as well as private and not-for-profit organizations with 50 or more employees must develop a statement of commitment.

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to develop a statement of commitment.

A statement of commitment establishes the vision and the goals for an organization. It is an important first step in the development of accessibility policies as it gives an organization purpose, clarity and direction.

Organizations must make their statement of commitment publicly available. This can be done in a number of ways, including posting it on the premises, such as on a bulletin board in a public area, or on the company website.

Organizations must also provide their statement of commitment in an accessible format on request. For example, a person with low vision may request the statement of commitment in large print.

Accessibility Policies

A policy is a formal organizational rule or principle to guide decisions and to achieve outcomes. A policy does not normally address how this rule or principle will be achieved. Organizations must establish accessibility policies describing what they do, or intend to do, to meet the requirements of the regulation.





The statement of commitment described earlier establishes a goal for an organization to work towards. An accessibility policy states what rules or principles an organization will put in place to support achieving its accessibility goal(s).



Developing an Accessibility Policy

Customer Service Standard Principles

Under the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service, organizations are required to use reasonable efforts to make their policies consistent with the following principles:

 dignity

 independence

 integration, except when alternate measures are necessary to meet the

needs of people with disabilities

 equal opportunity

Organizations may consider these principles to guide them in developing policies under the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation and in fostering accessibility generally.

For more information on these principles, please see the Accessibility Standard

for Customer Service: Employer Handbook

Content and Format of Policies

Organizations have the flexibility to create accessibility policies that best fit their existing organizational culture and business practices. They may choose to have one policy or a series of policies on accessibility. They may also choose to integrate the accessibility policy or policies into existing policies.

Organizations are only required to develop policies on the requirements that apply to their business. For example, a grocery store or a print shop would not need to develop policies required under the Transportation Standard since they are not a transportation service provider.





Documentation of Policies



Public sector, as well as private and not-for-profit organizations with 50 or more employees must document their policies in writing.

Private and not-for-profit sector organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to put their policies in writing.

If an organization has existing written policies or codes of practice, a best practice may be to integrate their accessibility requirements within these existing documents for consistency purposes.

For example, an organization may already have in place human resources policies on recruitment or performance management. Instead of developing separate policies on accessible recruitment and performance management, principles of accessibility can be incorporated into existing policies.

Availability of Policies

Public sector organizations, as well as private and not-for-profit organizations with 50 or more employees must make their accessibility policies available to the public.

 Organizations have the flexibility to meet this requirement in a way that

considers their existing business practices. For example, organizations may

post information about their accessibility policies on their premises, such as

on a bulletin board in a public area, on their website or through other

reasonable methods so that the public is aware the information is available.

 Organizations must also provide a copy of their policies to any person who

requests one. As well, the copy must be provided in an accessible format, if

required.

 Organizations must provide accessible formats of their accessibility policies to

their employees. Organizations have the flexibility to determine how best to

provide this information to an employee.





Maintaining Accessibility Policies



All obligated organizations must develop, implement and maintain their accessibility policies. Policies are living documents and should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect current practices of the organization.





Section 4



Accessibility Plans

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

4 (1) The Government of Ontario, Legislative Assembly, designated public sector organizations and large organizations shall,

a) establish, implement, maintain and document a multi-year accessibility plan, which outlines the organization’s strategy to prevent and remove barriers and meet its requirements under this Regulation;

b) post the accessibility plan on their website, if any, and provide the plan in an accessible format upon request; and

c) review and update the accessibility plan at least once every five years.

(2) The Government of Ontario, Legislative Assembly and designated public sector organizations shall establish, review and update their accessibility plans in consultation with persons with disabilities and, if they have established an accessibility advisory committee, they shall consult with the committee.

(3) The Government of Ontario, Legislative Assembly and designated public sector organizations shall,

a) prepare an annual status report on the progress of measures taken to implement the strategy referenced in clause (1)(a), including steps taken to comply with this Regulation; and

b) post the status report on their website, if any, and provide the report in an accessible format upon request.

(3.1) An upper-tier municipality and any lower-tier municipalities that form part of it for municipal purposes may prepare a joint accessibility plan and a joint annual status report.

(3.2) A joint accessibility plan and a joint annual status report prepared in accordance with subsection (3.1) are deemed to be the accessibility plan and annual status report of each municipality to which they apply and subsections (2) and (3) apply, with necessary modifications, where municipalities prepare a joint accessibility plan and a joint annual status report.





Intent of this Requirement



The intent of this requirement is that obligated organizations develop a multi-year accessibility plan, outlining their strategies to prevent and remove barriers to accessibility. Once developed, organizations must maintain their accessibility plan.

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to prepare multi-year accessibility plans.

Implementing the Requirement

Accessibility Plans

An accessibility plan describes the actions an organization will take to prevent and remove barriers, and when it will do so.

An accessibility plan creates a road map for an organization to increase accessibility. It puts into action an organization’s commitment to accessibility

(refer to the statement of commitment), and its accessibility policies.





Developing a Multi-year Accessibility Plan



Assessing the Organization

An assessment will help an organization determine where it currently stands with respect to accessibility for people with disabilities. An assessment will help determine what specific steps the organization needs to take to increase accessibility and how it can reach the goals in its accessibility policy.

The assessment will help an organization to better understand its readiness to meet its accessibility requirements. Further, an assessment will assist in developing an effective plan to prevent and remove barriers to accessibility.

An assessment could include a variety of existing organizational practices, such as business, operational, human resources, customer service, and others.

In order to get a broad perspective of existing barriers to accessibility within their organization, organizations could seek feedback from employees, clients, customers and people with disabilities.

Drafting a Multi-Year Accessibility Plan

The requirements under the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation are being phased-in over several years to allow organizations the time they need to incorporate accessibility into their regular business practices.

In their multi-year accessibility plan, organizations can document the short and long-term requirements they need to meet.

The multi-year accessibility plan lays out how organizations will accomplish the following:

 meet their accessibility requirements within required timelines specified in the

Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation

 address any current accessibility barriers

 prevent and remove future barriers

As well, when the accessibility plan is updated, organizations can highlight what they have accomplished and how they have successfully met the requirements in the regulation.





Making an Accessibility Plan Public



Organizations that are required to develop an accessibility plan must post a copy on their website, if they have one, and/or provide a copy to any person who requests one. Posting accessibility plans publicly gives organizations the opportunity to communicate their strategy for meeting accessibility, and sets expectations for the public.

Organizations must provide the plan in an accessible format, if requested.

Reviewing and Updating the Accessibility Plan

Accessibility plans are living documents. Organizations must review and update their plan every five years.

By updating their plan every five years, organizations can determine if they are on-track for meeting their requirements, highlight accomplishments that have been made, and make any adjustments needed in order to meet the timelines under the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation.

Organizations have five years from their compliance dates to review and update their plan. For example, designated public sector organizations with 50 or more employees must have their initial plans developed by January 1, 2013, and review and update their plans by January 1, 2018.

Additional Requirements for Transportation Service Providers

Conventional transportation service providers and specialized transportation service providers have additional accessibility plan requirements outlined under

the Accessible Transportation Standard.

Additional Requirements for Designated Public Sector Organizations

Consulting with People with Disabilities

In developing, reviewing and updating their accessibility plans, all designated public sector organizations must consult with people with disabilities.

If the organization has an accessibility advisory committee, this committee must also be included in the consultation process. Consultations provide people with disabilities with an opportunity to participate and provide valuable feedback that should help organizations maintain an awareness of people’s accessibility needs.





Preparing an Annual Public Status Update



All designated public sector organizations must prepare annual public status updates on the progress of the measures they have taken to implement the strategies referred to in their accessibility plans.

These updates are not required to be submitted to government. They are distinct from the accessibility compliance reports that obligated organizations are required to file to indicate their compliance with the regulation.

In these updates, organizations can announce measures that they have put in place to reduce barriers to accessibility and to keep the public informed of their progress.

All designated public sector organizations must make their annual status update available to the public by posting it on their website, if they have one, and

providing the update in accessible format, upon request.

Joint Accessibility Plans for Upper and Lower Tier Municipalities

The ability to submit joint accessibility plans currently exists within the Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2001. This amendment allows those organizations with a pre-established administrative relationship (such as upper and lower-tier municipalities) to submit plans jointly.

Organizations still have the ability to determine who within their organization is obligated to meet the accessibility standards. For example, if there is an agency within a municipality that is considered an obligated organization, municipalities can decide to include them in their joint accessibility plans.

Section 5

Procuring or Acquiring Goods, Services or Facilities

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

5(1) The Government of Ontario, Legislative Assembly and designated public sector organizations shall incorporate accessibility design, criteria and features when procuring or acquiring goods, services or facilities, except where it is not practicable to do so.





(2) If the Government of Ontario, Legislative Assembly or a designated public sector organization determines that it is not practicable to incorporate accessibility design, criteria and features when procuring or acquiring goods, services or facilities, it shall provide, upon request, an explanation.



Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that all designated public sector organizations incorporate accessibility design, criteria and features into their procurement practices so that goods, services, and facilities are more accessible to people with disabilities, unless it is not practicable to do so.

Designated public sector organizations with 50+ January 1, 2013 employees

Designated public sector organizations with 1-49 January 1, 2014 employees

This requirement only applies to the Government of Ontario, the Legislative Assembly and designated public sector organizations

Implementing the Requirement

Accessibility Design, Features and Criteria

Accessibility design, features and criteria must be considered and incorporated, where possible.

Features

Accessibility features include technical features (e.g., software), and structural features (e.g., physical design, including hardware or product specifications).





Design and Criteria



Organizations make decisions on what goods, services, or facilities they procure based on different design considerations and criteria.

For example, they may consider quality, cost and delivery terms. Additionally, some organizations may consider environmental or manufacturing criteria, i.e., more value is placed on products that meet green initiatives or are made-in-

Ontario products. Another criterion that could be included is accessibility

training. This may be important for organizations when hiring another organization to provide services for them.

Accessibility must be incorporated into an organization’s process for procuring or acquiring goods, services or facilities except when it is not practical to do so.

The enactment of the Design of Public Spaces Standard may be helpful in determining accessibility features in public spaces, such as outdoor play space equipment or accessible tables in outdoor eating areas.

Incorporating the Design of Public Spaces Standard requirements into multi-year accessibility plans and accessible procurement practices will help organizations plan and budget for the implementation of the standard before it comes into effect.

Determining Practicability

Factors relevant to practicability may include:

 availability of accessible goods, services or facilities  technological compatibility between older products and newer ones being

procured

When requested, an organization must provide an explanation as to why it did not incorporate accessibility design, criteria and features when procuring goods, services, or facilities. The explanation must be provided in an accessible format or with appropriate communications supports, if necessary.

For more detailed information go to the Information and Communications

Standard, Section 12 “Accessible Formats and Communications Supports”.





Section 6



Self-Service Kiosks

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

6(1) Without limiting the generality of section 5, the Government of Ontario, Legislative Assembly and designated public sector organizations shall incorporate accessibility features when designing, procuring or acquiring self-service kiosks.

(2) Large organizations and small organizations shall have regard to the accessibility for persons with disabilities when designing, procuring or acquiring self-service kiosks.

(3) The Government of Ontario, Legislative Assembly and designated public sector organizations shall meet the requirements of this section in accordance with the schedule set out in subsection 5 (3).

(4) Large organizations shall meet the requirements under subsection (2) as of January 1, 2014 and small organizations shall meet the requirements as of January 1, 2015.

(5) In this section, “kiosk” means an interactive electronic terminal, including a point-sale device, intended for public use that allows users to access one or more services or products or both.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that all organizations that offer services and/or products through self-service kiosks take steps to make them accessible, on a go forward-basis, to people with disabilities so they can be used independently and securely.





Table 4 - When do Organizations have to Comply



Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 1-49 employees January 1, 2015

The requirements are different for designated public sector organizations and private and not-for-profit organizations (see “Implementing the Requirement” below)

Implementing the Requirement

About Self-Service Kiosks

In this requirement, kiosk is used to describe an interactive electronic terminal including a point-of-sale device that the public can use to access one or more services or products, or both.

People use self-service kiosks for various purposes including paying for fares and parking, as well as for validating tickets and checking prices. Kiosks are also used as self-service checkouts in many retail stores today.

Most self-service kiosks allow people to complete transactions through point-of-sale devices using a debit, credit or other electronic funds card.

Example: A self-serve kiosk that uses touch-screen technology may be difficult, or impossible, to use for people who are blind or have low-vision unless an alternate (non-visual) mode of operation, such as an accessible tactile keyboard, is made available.





Self-Service Kiosks Accessibility Features



When determining what accessibility features can be included in the design or purchase of a kiosk, organizations may consider technical features, structural features, and the access path to the kiosk.

Technical features – includes the colour contrast on the display screen and the options to increase font size, as well as allowing for extra time to complete tasks. Other technical features include voice activating equipment and visual and non-visual modes of operation, etc.

Structural features – includes the height and stability of the kiosk, headset jacks with volume control, and specialized keypads or keyboards, etc.

Access path – includes reach ranges for people using mobility aids, the proximity of the kiosk to other objects, etc.

Regulatory Requirement for Designated Public Sector Organizations

The Ontario Government, Legislative Assembly, and all designated public sector organizations are required to incorporate accessibility features into their kiosks.

Under this requirement, “to incorporate” means that organizations must implement accessibility features into the kiosks. While the requirement does not specify what features should be built-into the design or purchase requirements for the kiosk, public sector organizations should consider the needs of all their customers and clients to make them accessible to the widest range of users.

Regulatory Requirement for Private and Not-for-Profit Organizations

All private and not-for profit organizations are required to have regard to accessibility features for their kiosks.

Under this requirement, “have regard to” means that organizations must consider what accessibility features they could build-into their kiosks to best meet the needs of their customers and clients. Organizations should strive to include accessibility features where possible, and consider the accessibility needs, preferences and abilities of the widest range of users.





Section 7



Training

Requirement as Stated in Regulation

7(1) Every obligated organization shall ensure that training is provided on the requirements of the accessibility standards referred to in this Regulation and on the Human Rights Code as it pertains to persons with disabilities to,

(a) all employees, and volunteers;

(b) all persons who participate in developing the organization’s policies; and

(c) all other persons who provide goods, services or facilities on behalf of the

organization.

(2) The training on the requirements of the accessibility standards and on the Human Rights Code referred to in subsection (1) shall be appropriate to the duties of the employees, volunteers and other persons.

(3) Every person referred to in subsection (1) shall be trained as soon as practicable.

(4) Every obligated organization shall provide training in respect of any changes to the policies described in section 3 on an ongoing basis.

(5) The Government of Ontario, the Legislative Assembly, every designated public sector organization and every large organization shall keep a record of the training provided under this section, including the dates on which the training is provided and the number of individuals to whom it is provided.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that all organizations train employees, volunteers, all those who participate in developing the organization’s policies, and all others who provide goods or services on behalf of the organization, about the requirements in the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation, as well as the Ontario Human Rights Code as it relates to people with disabilities. Table 5 - When do Organizations have to Comply





Affected Organizations Compliance Date



Ontario Government and Legislative Assembly January 1, 2013

Designated public sector organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2014

Designated public sector organizations with 1-49 January 1, 2015

employees

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2015

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 1-49 employees January 1, 2016



Implementing the Requirement

Organizations must provide training on the requirements in the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation and on the disability-related obligations under the Ontario Human Rights Code (the Code).

The training should include information about achieving accessibility by 2025 and highlight the requirements of the standards – Information and Communication, Employment, Transportation and Design of Public Spaces – in the regulation as they apply to the organization’s business.

As well, organizations must understand their requirements under the Code and the differences between the Code and Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation, and provide training accordingly.

Please follow this link to more information about the Code as it relates to people with disabilities.

Who Should Receive theTraining

The training must be provided to:

 All employees and volunteers, including paid and unpaid positions  Anyone who participates in developing the organization’s policies, which





might include managers, senior leaders, boards of directors, business owners



and independent operating regulated professionals

 Anyone who provides goods, services or facilities on behalf of the

organization, which might include outsourced services, such as payroll,

facilities management and contact centres

Training Based on Duties

Individuals should to be trained as needed to perform the duties of their jobs. It is therefore important to assess the requirements in the regulation against the roles or duties of the person or people within the organization.

Job descriptions, if used, are a good place to start when determining what information a person should receive in a training session, considering at the same time what the person does in practice on a regular basis.

Organizations have flexibility to determine how best to provide the training. An organization may determine one training session is appropriate for various employees even though they perform different duties, e.g., hostess, busser, server, and bartender. In other situations, the training may vary. For example, a human resources manager will need different training than a cashier in the same organization.

Training Formats and Methods

Organizations have the flexibility to determine the best training method for their organization.

Training can be provided in a variety of ways. It can be a separate training program or included as part of an orientation session or a larger training program.

The training can also be delivered in different formats such as handouts or PowerPoint presentations at orientation sessions, or staff meetings, or as on-line training modules.





Timing of Training



In addition to meeting the initial timelines requirement, organizations are required to provide training on an ongoing basis, such as when new employees join organizations, or when their accessibility policies change.

For example, some organizations have standardized training schedules. This allows them to build accessibility training into their regular training schedules, and train within existing business practices.

Record of Training

All organizations, with the exception of private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees, must keep records of the number of individuals who were trained, and the dates that the training was provided.

Information for Educators and Transportation Service Providers

In addition to the general training requirement set out in this section, educators and transportation service providers have additional training requirements.

For more information on accessibility training for educators, please see

Information and Communications Standard, Section 16, “Training to Educators”.

For more information on accessibility training for transportation service providers,

please see Transportation Standard, Section 36, “Accessibility Training”.





Section 8



Exemption from Filing Accessibility Reports

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

8(1) Small organizations are exempted from the requirement to file accessibility reports under section 14 of the Act with respect to the accessibility standards in this Regulation.

(2) The following are the reasons for the exemption:

1. It is consistent with a phased approach to implementing the Act.

2. It allows the exempted obligated organizations to focus their efforts and

resources on complying with the accessibility standards.

Intent of this Requirement

Organizations with fewer than 49 employees are exempt from the requirement to file accessibility reports.

This exemption reduces the regulatory burden for small organizations and allows them to focus their efforts and resources on complying with the accessibility standards and achieving results.

When do Organizations Have to Comply

This exemption applies to private and not-for profit organizations with 1-49 employees.

Implementing the Requirement

All organizations with one or more employees must comply with requirements in the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation under the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.

Under section 14 of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, organizations are required to file annual accessibility reports outlining the organizations’ progress towards becoming accessible for people with disabilities. This regulation exempts small organizations, those with 1 – 49 employees, from filing accessibility reports.



These organizations, however, may be required to submit compliance-related information or other reports, and they may be subjected to compliance audits or inspections.



The government will continue to help small organizations comply with the regulation and become accessible by providing tools, resources and education materials.





Part 2 - Information and Communications



Standard

Overview

The Information and Communications Standard outlines requirements for organizations to create, provide and receive information and communications in ways that are accessible for people with disabilities. This should help people with disabilities access sources of information and communications that many of us rely on every day.

For example, it will help people with vision loss access more websites using their screen readers, expand large print and digital collections in public libraries and provide students with course information and learning materials in accessible formats.

Accessibility benefits everyone. Making accessibility a part of the way organizations send and receive information and communications will help business tap into opportunities to attract more customers, build customer loyalty and improve services. Reaching out to customers with disabilities may enable business to tap into $9.6 billion more in revenue.

Ontario Human Rights Code

The Ontario Human Rights Code requires organizations to accommodate people with disabilities to the point of undue hardship.

The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation does not replace or affect legal rights or obligations that arise under the Ontario Human Rights Code and other laws relating to the accommodation of people with disabilities. This means that the Ontario Human Rights Code or other applicable legislation may require additional accommodation measures that go beyond or are different from the standards established by the regulations of the AODA.

Section 9



Definitions and Exceptions

The terms and exceptions identified below are intended to provide assistance in understanding and implementing the requirements outlined in the Information and Communications Standard.

Definitions

communications – the term communications as it used in the Information and Communications Standard refers to the interaction between two or more people or entities when information is provided, sent or received.

conversion ready – refers to an electronic or digital format that assists conversion into an accessible format such as Braille, large print, audio cassettes, CDs, DVDs, etc.

information – the term information as it is used in the Information and Communications Standard refers to knowledge, data and facts that convey meaning and that exist in any format such as text, audio, digital or images.

Exceptions

These exceptions apply to all requirements within the Information and Communications Standard.

The Information and Communications Standard does not apply to the following:

1. Products and product labels, except as specifically provided by this Part.

2. Unconvertible information or communications.

3. Information that the obligated organization does not control directly or

indirectly through a contractual relationship, except as required under

sections 15 and 18.

If an obligated organization determines that information or communications are unconvertible, the organization must provide the person requesting the information or communication with:  an explanation as to why the information or communications are





unconvertible; and



 a summary of the unconvertible information or communications.

For the purposes of the Information and Communications Standard, information or communications are unconvertible if,

 it is not technically feasible to convert the information or communications; or  the technology to convert the information or communications is not readily

available.

Application of Exception

The Information and Communications Standard requires people and organizations to provide accessible information and communications about the goods, services or facilities offered to customers, clients and others.

It is not about making products, e.g., cold medicine, DVDs, etc. and/or labels on the packaging of these products, accessible.

In the examples of cold medicine or DVDs, a drugstore would have to find accessible ways to inform customers about the cold medicine available on the shelves and how to safely use it. A video store would have to find accessible ways to inform customers about their DVD selection.

Education and training institutions (as defined in the regulation) and their libraries, as well as producers of education and training materials and public libraries need to refer to their specific parts of the regulation (sections 15, 17, 18 and 19) to understand their obligations in terms of products.

The standard applies to information or communications an organization can directly control, meaning information an organization creates, owns or where a contractual relationship with a third party provider allows for modification. If an organization has control over the information or communications, they would have to convert it into an accessible format or provide it with appropriate communication supports, upon request.

For more information on accessible formats and communication supports, please

see Information and Communications Standard, Section 12, “Accessible Formats

and Communication Supports”.





Section 10



Application

Under the Information and Communications Standard, the following sections apply to all obligated organizations:

9. Definitions and exceptions

11. Feedback

12. Accessible formats and communication supports

13. Emergency procedure, plans or public safety information





Section 11



Feedback

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

11(1) Every obligated organization that has processes for receiving and responding to feedback shall ensure that the processes are accessible to persons with disabilities by providing or arranging for accessible formats and communications supports, upon request.

(2) Nothing in this section detracts from the obligations imposed under section 7 of Ontario Regulation 429/07 (Accessibility Standards for Customer Service) made under the Act.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that all organizations with a process(es) for receiving and responding to feedback make them available to people with disabilities in accessible formats or with appropriate communication supports, on request.

Note: The regulation only applies to organizations that have processes for receiving and responding to feedback. Organizations that do not have processes are not required to create such processes.

Implementing the Requirement

Receiving and Responding to Feedback

Many organizations have external and/or internal processes in place to receive and respond to feedback from their clients, customers or employees. Those organizations that have processes in place to receive and respond to feedback must make them accessible to individuals with disabilities, on request.

Note: The regulation does not require organizations to create feedback processes if they do not currently use one.

Here are some of the ways organizations receive and respond to feedback.

Feedback from the Public

There are many different ways for organizations to get feedback from the public, including the following methods:

 Follow-up phone surveys, e.g., after customers purchase new vehicles, the

dealership calls them to ask if they are satisfied with their purchase.

 On-line questionnaires, e.g., a retail store sends its customers a survey

asking them about their shopping habits and the types of stores they

frequently visit.

 Cards to complete, e.g., after finishing their meals at a restaurant, customers

are given comment cards to rate the quality of their experience.

Feedback from Employees

Many organizations have established feedback processes for employees to comment on their experience in the workplace. Larger organizations may use web-based surveys or emails to collect feedback, while smaller organizations may choose to meet and talk with their employees or provide them printed evaluation forms to complete.





Customer Service Standard Feedback Requirement



Under the Customer Service Standard, obligated organizations must establish a customer service feedback process for receiving and responding to feedback specifically about the manner in which they provide accessible goods or services to people with disabilities.

Obligated organizations must also make the information about their feedback processes available to the public. The processes must allow for feedback in a variety of ways including in person, by telephone, by writing or via email. The processes must also specify the actions that the organizations are required to take when complaints are received.

Obligated organizations need to comply with this requirement within the timelines

specified in the Accessibility Standards for Customer Service.

Creating an Accessible Feedback Process

Providing accessible feedback processes may mean that instead of only one method for feedback, such as hand-written letters, organizations will need to be prepared to receive feedback in other ways such as over the telephone or by email, if requested.

When organizations provide customers with questionnaires or comment cards, they will also be required to provide the information in accessible formats or with the appropriate communication supports, on request.

Example: Some stores and workplaces have comment cards on which customers and employees can leave comments. These may be inaccessible to some people. If an individual requests an accessible way to offer feedback, the organization will have to develop another acceptable method such as verbal (over the telephone) or electronic (email) feedback.

Note: Lessons learned from implementing the accessible Customer Service feedback process may be applicable to increasing accessibility in all feedback processes the organization may have. Accessible Formats and Communication Supports





When making their feedback processes accessible, organizations are required to



meet the requirements of Information and Communications Standard, Section 12

– “Accessible Formats and Communications Supports”. This section includes a list of accessible formats and communication supports.





Section 12



Accessible Formats and Communication Supports

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

12(1) Except as otherwise provided, every obligated organization shall upon request provide or arrange for the provision of accessible formats and communication supports for persons with disabilities,

a) in a timely manner that takes into account the person’s accessibility needs due to disability; and

b) at a cost that is no more than the regular cost charged to other persons.

(2) The obligated organization shall consult with the person making the request in determining the suitability of an accessible format or communication support.

(3) Every obligated organization shall notify the public about the availability of accessible formats and communication supports.

(4) Every obligated organization that is required to provide accessible formats or accessible formats and communication supports by section 3, 4, 11, 13, 19, 26, 28, 34, 37, 44 or 64 shall meet the requirements of subsections (1) and (2) but shall do so in accordance with the schedule set out in the referenced section and shall do so only to the extent that the requirements in subsections (1) and (2) are applicable to the requirements set out in the referenced section.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that all organizations provide information and communicate in an accessible manner about their goods, services or facilities to people with disabilities, on request.

The information must be provided in a timely manner and at a cost that is no more than the regular price charged to others.

Organizations are not required to make products and/or product labels

accessible. Please refer to Section 9 – “Application of Exception” for more information.

About Accessible Formats and Communication Supports

Some people use methods other than standard print to access information. Some communicate in ways other than the spoken word.

Alternatives to standard print are often referred to as “accessible formats”, and methods to assist communication are referred to as “communication supports”.

To be accessible to people with disabilities, organizations must be able to provide and to receive information and communications in an accessible manner.

There are many ways to do this, here are some examples:

 accessible electronic formats such as HTML and MS Word  Braille

 accessible audio formats

 large print





 text transcripts of visual and audio information



 reading the written information aloud to the person directly  exchanging hand-written notes (or providing a note taker or communication

assistant)

 1 captioning or audio description

 assistive listening systems

 augmentative and alternative communication methods and strategies such as

the use of letter, word or picture boards, and devices that speak out

messages

 sign language interpretation and intervenor services  repeating, clarifying, or restating information

The requirement only applies to information and communications that an organization controls directly or indirectly through contractual relationships. The requirement does not apply to information one organization may be sharing on behalf of another organization.

Example: A hotel has information about its own facilities and also displays pamphlets on behalf of other organizations, such as local restaurants, in its lobby. The hotel is required to provide information about its own facilities in accessible formats. It is not required to provide the information about the restaurants (or the information from any other organization over which it does not have direct or indirect control of) in accessible formats.

Note: In the example above, the organization has obligations under the Customer Service Regulation to provide accessible customer service. For example, the hotel might ask staff to tell people with visual disabilities about the information contained in the pamphlets.

Consulting with the Person Making the Request

When an individual requests an accessible format or communication support, organizations are required to consult with the person to determine their accessibility needs. Consultation is important to make sure the appropriate support is provided, for example not all persons who are blind use Braille.

Once this is established, the regulation gives organizations the flexibility to

1 Note: Live captioning and audio description are excluded from Accessible Web

Requirements – see section 14 for more information.





decide on the most appropriate accessible format or communication supports, given the needs of the person and the organizations’ capability to deliver.



Example: A customer with a visual disability is unable to read a small retail store’s written return policy. The store is required to work with the customer to determine an acceptable way of providing this information, based on the individual’s needs and the capacity of the store to deliver certain formats and supports. In this situation, it may be acceptable for a store clerk to read out the store’s return policy to the customer with a visual disability.

Unconvertible Information

Some forms of information may be difficult or impossible to convert into an accessible format. For example, the visual information in an x-ray or architectural blue-print may be lost in the conversion processes, or an organization may not have access to the technologies that convert documents into accessible formats.

Organizations will need to determine, in consultation with the person requesting the information or communications, if it is possible to provide it in an accessible format or with appropriate communication supports.

If an organization determines they are unable to convert the information or communications into an accessible format, they will need to explain to the person why they are unable to do so and provide a summary of the content.

Example: A customer with a disability has requested that a document containing complex charts is provided in an accessible format. The organization can convert the text in the document into an accessible format and provide it to the person; however they are unable to convert the information contained in the charts. The organization must let the person know why the charts couldn’t be converted into an accessible format and then provide a summary of the information in the charts.

Meeting Requests in a Timely Manner

Organizations are not required to have all types of formats or supports on hand or in stock. However, organizations must provide formats and supports in a timely manner.

In some cases, organizations will be able to provide the information or communications quickly. In other cases organizations may need more time for a variety of reasons, such as the availability of the format requested, the complexity and amount of information being provided, and the resources and internal capacity of the organization.





The regulation does not specify how quickly an organization should provide accessible formats or communication supports; however being prepared, where possible, will better enable organizations to respond to requests. Organizations have the flexibility to determine “timely manner” based on their ability to deliver the requested accessible format or communication support.



For example, when organizations have documents available in accessible electronic formats such as HTML or MS Word, it is easier to convert these documents to other formats such as Braille. These accessible electronic formats are also compatible with screen reading software. This means organizations can likely respond to requests quickly by emailing the documents to individuals with disabilities to use with their own assistive technology.

Providing Information at No Additional Cost

If an organization charges the public fees for the documents, it cannot charge higher fees for the same documents provided in accessible formats. Similarly, if an organization does not charge fees for documents, then it cannot charge fees for accessible formats of the documents.

Public Notification

Organizations are required to notify the public about the availability of accessible formats and communication supports. The information can be posted on their premises, such as on bulletin boards in public areas, on their website, or through other reasonable methods.





Section 13



Emergency Procedures, Plans or Public Safety Information

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

13(1) In addition to its obligations under section 12, if an obligated organization prepares emergency procedures, plans or public safety information and makes the information available to the public, the obligated organization shall provide the information in an accessible format or with appropriate communication supports, as soon as practicable, upon request.

(2) Obligated organizations that prepare emergency procedures, plans or public safety information and make the information available to the public shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2012.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that publicly available emergency and public safety information is provided in an accessible format or with appropriate communication supports, on request.

Organizations are not required to develop or create new emergency or public safety information. Further, organizations are not required to convert this information into accessible formats or provide communication supports if they do not share the information publicly. Some organizations have confidential internal plans, such as those for security lockdowns that are not shared publicly.

However, organizations may have requirements under the Accessible Employment Standard to provide individualized emergency information to its employees. For more detailed information, go to the Employment Standard,

Section 27 “Workplace Emergency Response Information”.

This requirement applies to all organizations that prepare public emergency procedures, plans or public safety information and that make them available to the public.

Implementing this Requirement

Providing emergency and public safety plans in accessible formats or with communications supports, should enable people with disabilities to be prepared in case there is an emergency situation.

What is Emergency and Public Safety Information?

Prepared emergency and public safety information refers to the emergency plans and procedures that organizations develop before an emergency occurs.

This may include evacuation procedures and floor plans, information about alarms or information about other incidents that may threaten life, property, operations or the environment. It does not include real-time emergency or real-time public safety information, e.g., a fire evacuation, or an emergency at a large public gathering.





Note: The Fire Code, a regulation made under the Fire Protection and Prevention Act, requires that evacuation procedures include provisions for people requiring assistance.



What is “As Soon As Practicable?”

As soon as practicable means as soon as possible given all of the circumstances after a person with a disability asks for the information in an accessible format or with communication supports.

Although organizations are not required to have accessible formats on hand, they should recognize the critical nature of emergency and public safety information.

Some people with a disability may need more time to plan for emergency situations; organizations should respond promptly to requests for this type of information.

For example: When booking rooms at a hotel, several individuals with disabilities ask for its fire evacuation procedures in accessible formats. The hotel consults with these individuals to learn what they need and provides the information when they arrive at the hotel. By doing so, the hotel gives its guests with disabilities the information in a timely manner and in formats that allow them to understand the evacuation procedures.

When providing emergency and public safety information in an accessible format or with appropriate communication supports, organizations are required to meet the requirements of the Information and Communications Standard, Section 12 “Accessible Formats and Communications Supports”.

For more information on accessible formats and communication supports, please

go to the Glossary, which gives a general description. For more detailed

information go to Information and Communications Standard, Section 12

“Accessible Formats and Communications Supports”.

Current Practices for Emergency Plans

Many organizations are legally required to share prepared emergency and public safety information with the public. For example, the Fire Code requires some property owners to post their procedures for fire related emergencies in public places. These procedures are based on the types of buildings and the number of occupants permitted in them.



Many public sector organizations are required, under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, to have publicly shared emergency plans for a variety of events such as outbreaks of influenza and severe weather such as tornadoes and ice storms.



In some situations, organizations may not be legally required to share emergency and/or public safety information with the public but may choose to do so. For example, organizations may develop and implement emergency plans for blackouts and share the information with their customers or clients. Others may prepare emergency plans for chemical spills or natural disasters, such as earthquakes or floods.

Furthermore, the role of some organizations includes sharing public safety information. Police and fire departments share strategies for public safety and fire prevention with members of their communities. Similarly, medical offices often share public health information with patients.

Implementing the Requirement

All obligated organizations’ websites, and the content on those websites, must conform with WCAG 2.0. This requirement applies to new websites first, and then over the next several years to all websites.

Many organizations control their websites and web content, including web-based applications, either directly or through a contractual relationship. That is, they may develop a website and web content in house or they may hire a consultant. In both cases, the organization has control of the functionality and the appearance of the website, as well as its content. Therefore, the organization has the responsibility and ability to incorporate accessibility.

Terminology

Understanding the terminology is the first step to implementing this requirement successfully.





Organizations should refer to the definitions in Section 14 (7) in the Regulation for more information.



The following is an easy reference list of definitions for other key terms used in this section of the regulation.

What is WCAG?

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 is an international standard for making websites and web content accessible to a broader range of users with disabilities.

WCAG was developed by a team of experts from around the world. The first version, WCAG 1.0, was released in 1999. WCAG 2.0 was released in 2008.

What does Level A and Level AA mean?

WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA refer to a series of technical checkpoints that make websites and their content increasingly accessible to a broader range of users with disabilities.

Level AA builds on Level A’s checkpoints.

What does new website and content mean?

A new website refers to a site with a new domain name — a brand new web address. The term does not refer to a new page or new link on an existing site.

The term also refers to a site with an existing domain name that is undergoing a significant “refresh”. There is not an industry standard definition for significant refresh. In this context, “significant refresh” could include, but is not limited to, the following elements:

 a new look and feel to the website

 a change in how users navigate around it

 a major update and change to the content of the website.

Content may include any information that may be found on a web page or web application, including text, images, forms and sounds.

What does practicable mean?

Organizations are required to meet their WCAG 2.0 requirements, unless it is not practicable to do so.





Under this requirement, practicability refers to the organization’s ability given all of the circumstances to modify their websites and web content.



Section 14(6) of the regulation states that when organizations are determining whether meeting the requirement is practicable, they may consider the following factors, among others:

 the availability of commercial software or tools

 the affect that the deadline would have on the implementation timelines for

projects that were planned or initiated before January 1, 2012.

Additionally, transactional applications may have significant refreshes that are on a different cycle than the rest of the website. Organizations may take this into account when considering what is practicable.

Website Information Posted Prior to 2012

Content published on a website before January 1, 2012 is not required to be compliant with WCAG 2.0. However, people with disabilities can still request

information to be provided in an accessible format under the Section 12,

“Accessible Formats and Communication Supports”.

Website Information Posted After 2012

Web content, including documents such as Word and PDFs, posted after January 1, 2012 will need to be accessible as per the regulation.

Availability of Commercial Software and Tools

Some organizations may have used software, web applications and other tools that pre-date WCAG 2.0 to develop their websites and web content. These tools may have varying ability to create websites and web content that will conform with WCAG 2.0 requirements. As a result, organizations have until 2021 to comply as this will allow them to take advantage of emerging software, web applications and tools to make existing websites and web content accessible.

Technological Capability

Some organizations may be limited by technological capability. For example, there may be technological software limitations in making online maps and complex diagrams accessible to people with visual disabilities. In such cases, an accessible alternate version can be provided if requested.





Projects Planned Prior to January 1, 2012



In determining practicability, the regulation allows organizations to consider projects planned before January 1, 2012 that may be significantly affected by implementing WCAG 2.0 requirements.

However, once updated, websites and web content would need to meet the WCAG 2.0 compliance dates set out in the regulation.

Some of the WCAG 2.0 requirements can improve the accessibility of an application and would not significantly delay implementation. Organizations are required to think about and take reasonable steps to overcome barriers that people with disabilities might encounter when using their websites.

Staggered Timelines for Compliance

The regulation has staggered timelines for designated public sector organizations, as well as private and not-for-profit organizations with 50 or more employees. These organizations must comply with WCAG 2.0, Level A and then with WCAG, 2.0 Level AA, excluding the requirements for live captioning and pre-recorded audio descriptions.

Staggered timelines allow organizations to build accessibility into their regular re-fresh cycles and to implement systematic approaches to increase their web accessibility and to meet the compliance dates. On average, organizations update their website every two or three years; the timelines will allow two or three opportunities for organizations to build accessibility into their regular website update.

By planning for accessibility in advance, organizations may be able to reduce their costs as well as to improve web-based experiences for people with disabilities.





Section 15



Educational and Training Resources and Materials

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

15(1) Every obligated organization that is an educational or training institution shall do the following, if notification of need is given:

1. Provide educational or training resources or materials in an accessible format that takes into account the accessibility needs due to a disability of the person with a disability to whom the material is to be provided by,

i. procuring through purchase or obtaining by other means an accessible or conversion ready electronic format of educational or training resources or materials, where available, or

ii. arranging for the provision of a comparable resource in an accessible or conversion ready electronic format, if educational or training resources or materials cannot be procured, obtained by other means or converted into an accessible format.

2. Provide student records and information on program requirements, availability and descriptions in an accessible format to persons with disabilities.

(2) For purposes of this section and sections 16, 17 and 18, an obligated organization is an educational or training institution if it falls into one of the following categories:

1. It is governed by the Education Act or the Private Career Colleges Act,

2005.

2. It offers all or part of a post-secondary program leading to a degree

pursuant to a consent granted under the Post-Secondary Education Choice and Excellence Act, 2000.

3. It is a designated public sector organization described in paragraph 3 or 4

of Schedule 1.

4. It is a public or private organization that provides courses or programs or

both that result in the acquisition by students of a diploma or certificate





named by the Minister of Education under paragraph 1 of subsection 8 (1) of the Education Act.



5. It is a private school within the meaning of the Education Act.

Intent of the Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that all educational and training institutions, as defined in the Integrated Accessibility Standard Regulation, will provide students who have disabilities with the following in an accessible format:

 educational and training materials and/or resources  student records

 course and program information.

For more detailed information, go to Information and Communications Standard,

Section 12, “Accessible Formats and Communication Supports”.

Implementing the Requirement

Notification of Need

Students can notify educational or training institutions of their need for information in accessible formats. In certain circumstances, parents or legal guardians can also notify the institutions.

It is important for educational and training institutions to be responsive once they know of a student’s need and to work towards providing the appropriate accessible or conversion ready formats in a timely manner.

Educational and training institutions that use Individualized Education Plans (IEP), or similar plans, should indicate what types of formats and/or supports the student requires. This would be considered another form of notification of need. Similar plans dealing with the needs of students with disabilities may also constitute a notification of need.

Resources and Materials

Institutions will need to provide materials or resources in accessible or conversion-ready formats that take into account the accessibility needs of the student, when notified. The institutions can buy this material in accessible or conversion ready formats, procure it by other means, or arrange for a comparable resource.

Ideally, institutions will be able to provide accessible or conversion-ready versions of the same materials and resources used in the classroom. When this is not possible, institutions are required to provide students with similar resources or materials that will, to the degree possible, allow for the same or a comparable learning opportunity.

Example: An accessible version of a globe for a person with a visual disability could be a tactile world map. Although a map is not the same resource as a globe, it would provide the student with a similar learning opportunity. In many cases, the resources and materials used by educational and training institutions are developed and published by other organizations.



In such cases, the institutions do not have control over the content of the information or how it was published. Nevertheless, they are still required to provide all information used in the classroom to students who have disabilities in accessible or conversion-ready formats.



When it is not technically feasible to provide the information in an accessible or a conversion-ready format, the institution is required to provide a comparable resource. If an institution decides that the materials requested are unconvertible, then it must explain why and provide a summary of the information.

Example: An institution is asked to convert a medical textbook to an accessible format. Although converting the text poses no problem, the technology does not exist to convert the complex medical images. In this case, the institution is required to convert the text into an accessible or conversion-ready format, and where the images were found, to provide summaries or descriptions of them.

Student Records and Program Information

When an educational or training institution is notified of an accessibility need, they are required to provide student records, program requirements, course descriptions, and information on the availability of courses in an accessible format. Institutions will need to be prepared for requests from current and former students, as well as potential students.

Educational and training institutions are required to work with the individual to determine which type of format will be provided. For example, a student with a visual disability may prefer accessible documents that can be used with their screen reader technology. In many cases, educational and training institutions will have the capacity in-house to provide this information in an accessible format.

There may be occasions when educational or training institutions are unable to create an accessible format of the student’s records in-house. This may be because of the complexity of the record or the format requested. If an institution hires an external company to convert this information, then it should put in place measures to protect the privacy of the student’s personal information.

Section 16



Training to Educators

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

16(1) In addition to the requirements under section 7, obligated organizations that are school boards or educational or training institutions shall provide educators with accessibility awareness training related to accessible program or course delivery and instruction.

(2) Obligated organizations that are school boards or educational or training institutions shall keep a record of the training provided under this section, including the dates on which the training is provided and the number of individuals to whom it is provided.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that educators receive accessibility awareness training so they can create inclusive environments in their classrooms and increase the opportunities for learning for students with disabilities.

Implementing the Requirement

School boards as well as education and training institutions are required to provide training to their educators. In the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation, the term ‘educator’ refers to any employee who is involved in designing, delivering or instructing courses. This includes teaching assistants, educational assistants, early childhood educators, and staff of school boards.

The requirement does not apply to parents who volunteer, students working in job placements, or other individuals who participate in classroom activities or act in a role of educator. However, when these persons are acting in an educator role, it may be helpful if the classroom educators passed on what they had learned during their accessibility training.

For example: A student teacher is developing a lesson plan. The classroom teacher can work with the student teacher to address the accessibility needs of students with disabilities in the plan.

Accessibility Awareness Training

The purpose of the training is to increase educators’ awareness of accessibility needs in program or course delivery and instruction. Increasing accessibility in classrooms is important for student success and involvement.

Aspects of accessibility awareness training may include:

 different types of disabilities

 needs often associated with different types of disabilities  barriers students with disabilities encounter in schools  techniques that improve the learning environment for students with

disabilities.

The training should encourage educators to consider a variety of learning resources and materials when developing their lesson plans and choosing their resources or materials.



Examples:



 Before using movies in classes, educators should consider if there are any

students who are hard of hearing or deaf. If the movie has closed-captioning,

then it may be suitable to use. When movies are not accessible to all of the

students, the educators should consider other resources.

 A student with a physical disability may not be able to participate in the

dissection component of a biology class. The school could provide the

student with a virtual program that would allow for a similar learning

opportunity.

The regulation does not state how the accessibility awareness training should be provided. It is up to the institutions or school boards to decide on the best training methods for their educators. For example, it could be part of a larger training program, or it could be an individual course completed independently by educators. School boards or institutions could offer the training using handouts, on-line learning modules, or one-day workshops.

Training Record

School boards and education and training institutions will need to keep records of the training. They must include the dates on which the training took place and the number of individuals who attended.

Relationship with General Training Requirement

School boards and educational and training institutions still have to comply with

the training requirements set out in Part 1 General Requirements, Section 7,

“Training”.





Section 17



Producers of Educational or Training Material

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

17(1) Every obligated organization that is a producer of educational or training textbooks for educational or training institutions shall upon request, make accessible or conversion ready versions of the textbooks available to the institutions.

(2) Every obligated organization that is a producer of print-based educational or training supplementary learning resources for educational or training institutions shall upon request, make accessible or conversion ready versions of the printed materials available to the institutions

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that producers of textbooks and print-based supplementary educational and training resources provide educational and training institutions with accessible or conversion-ready versions of these materials, when requested.

If producers make textbooks and print-based supplementary resources available in accessible and conversion-ready formats, then institutions will be able to provide them to students with disabilities in a timely manner.

Table 12 - When do Organizations have to Comply

Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

All organizations that produce textbooks January 1, 2015

All organizations that produce printed educational or January 1, 2020 training supplementary learning resources



Implementing the Requirement

In the context of the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation, producers are organizations that provide textbooks and other print-based supplementary learning resources to educational and training institutions. In Ontario, universities, university presses, private publishing companies, and school boards, among others, produce these materials.



For more information of the definition of educational and training institutions,



please go to Information and Communications Standard, Section 15,

“Educational and Training Resources and Materials”.

Unconvertible Information

In some cases, producers may be unable to convert part of the information in a textbook or supplementary learning resource to an accessible or conversion-ready format. If this happens, then the producer must explain the reason why and provide a summary of the information.

Example: A producer is asked to convert a medical textbook into an accessible format. Although converting the text poses no problem, the technology does not exist to convert the complex medical images. In this case, the producer is required to convert the text into an accessible or conversion-ready format, and where the images were found, to provide summaries or descriptions of them.

Producers should notify the requesting institution of any limitations that would slow them down or prevent them from providing conversion- ready or accessible formats. For example, the producer might not be able to convert a textbook because the organization does not control the content. If this happens, then the educational and training institutions are required to provide students with comparable learning resources or materials.

For more information on:

 accessible formats

 conversion-ready formats

 the term unconvertible

please go to the glossary, which gives a general description. For more detailed

information, go to Information and Communication Standard, Section 12,

“Accessible Formats and Communication Supports”.





Section 18



Libraries of Educational and Training Institutions

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

18(1) Subject to subsection (2) and where available, the libraries of educational and training institutions that are obligated organizations shall provide, procure or acquire by other means an accessible or conversion ready format of print, digital or multimedia resources or materials for a person with a disability, upon request.

(2) Special collections, archival materials, rare books and donations are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1).

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that, on request, libraries of educational and training institutions will provide accessible or conversion-ready formats of library materials when they are available. This requirement does not include rare books, special collections, archived materials, and donated books and other donated materials.

For more information about the definition of educational and training institutions,

digital or multimedia resources or

materials



Implementing the Requirement

When requested, and where available, libraries of educational and training institutions are required to provide accessible or conversion-ready formats of print, digital or multimedia resources or materials to students with disabilities.

Print resources can include, but are not limited to, books, magazines, posters, journals, newspapers and newspaper articles. Digital or multimedia resources are usually a combination of text and audio and include, but are not limited to, materials such as films, videos, CD-ROMS and DVDs.

Under the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation educational and training libraries are not required to provide accessible or conversion-ready formats of their special collections, archival materials, rare books and books or other materials that have been donated. However, these organizations do have

requirements to accommodate students with disabilities under the Ontario

Human Rights Code.

Availability of Information

Even if they do not control the information, libraries of educational and training institutions are required to provide accessible or conversion-ready formats of resources and materials, where available. In some cases, the libraries may need to take additional steps to find the requested materials in accessible or conversion ready formats including contacting the publishers or asking for inter-library loans. Example: A college library in a small city does not have a 19th century novel written in another language in an accessible or conversion-ready format. However, after a search, the librarians discover that a university library in another city does have the novel in a conversion-ready format, and they put in a request for an inter-library loan.



Unconvertible Information



There may be times when a library is unable to provide the material in accessible or conversion ready formats. If a library learns that the requested materials or resources are unconvertible, then it needs to explain the reason why and provide a summary of the information. The summary must take into account the accessibility needs of the person who made the request.

Example: A student who has a visual disability has requested a book on the history of art. After an extensive search, the librarians conclude that they cannot obtain the whole book in an accessible or conversion ready format. They can provide the student with an accessible version of the text; however it does not contain the images. In this case, the library is required to explain the reason why and to provide the student with a summary of the images which could include the artists’ names and time periods or a general description of the images.

For more information on conversion-ready formats and accessible formats,

please go to the glossary, which gives a general description. For more detailed

Section 19



Public Libraries

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

19. (1) Every obligated organization that is a library board shall provide access to or arrange for the provision of access to accessible materials where they exist.

(2) Obligated organizations that are library boards shall make information about the availability of accessible materials publicly available and shall provide the information in accessible format or with appropriate communication supports, upon request.

(3) Obligated organizations that are library boards may provide accessible formats for archival materials, special collections, rare books and donations.

(4) Obligated organizations that are library boards shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2013

(5) For the purposes of this section library board means a board as defined in the Public Libraries Act, a public library service established under the Northern Services Board Act or a county library established under the County of Lambton Act, 1944, being Chapter Pr31 of the Statutes of Ontario 1994, the County of Elgin Act, 1985, being chapter Pr16 of the Statutes of Ontario, 1985 of the County of Lennox and Addington Act, 1978, being chapter 126 of the Statutes of Ontario, 1978.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that, when requested, public libraries provide access to accessible library materials, where they exist.

When do Organizations have to Comply

All public library boards, as defined in the Integrated Accessibility Standards

Regulation, are required to meet this requirement by January 1, 2013.

In the context of this requirement, “accessible materials” includes all works of literary, musical, artistic, dramatic nature, in accessible formats such as, but not limited to, print, electronic, video, DVD, audio, braille, etc. Library boards are required to provide access to, or arrange for access to, accessible materials where they exist. Under the Public Libraries Act, library boards are already accountable to their community in terms of provision of service, including access to works in the collection.



Some library boards will have extensive collections of accessible materials, while other library systems may have smaller collections. In some cases, library systems may want to consider using document-sharing systems such as the inter-library loan system in Ontario to provide accessible materials to their users.



When procuring new library materials, library boards are required to consider the accessibility needs of their users so that their collections are accessible to the widest range of people.

Special Collections, Rare Books and Archival Materials

If possible, libraries may provide archival material, rare books and special collections in accessible formats.

Rare books, special collections and archival materials in public libraries are usually kept apart from the circulating collection. They may require special handling and treatment for conservation purposes, and may be in fragile condition and/or may be original works. The technology may not be available to convert some of these documents into accessible formats without damaging the documents or losing their meaning. In this case, libraries may choose to make the works accessible, if possible (e.g. technological solutions, or photocopying).

Notification

Library boards are required to tell the public about the availability of accessible materials within their library systems.

For example, the boards may choose to tell the public by posting the information on their websites, or on bulletin boards in their libraries, or in the boards’ publications that list events, classes and courses at the libraries.

When notifying the public, libraries may choose to explain what materials are available within the community’s public library system, including identifying accessible materials in the library’s on-line catalogue or what materials are available through the inter-library loan system. Library boards may also want to mention how long inter-library loans can take. They may also describe other materials that are available in accessible formats, e.g., information on community events.



Library boards are required to make sure that when they notify the public about the availability of accessible materials, they do so in accessible formats or with the appropriate communication supports, when requested.



This notification requirement only applies to information and communications that the library boards control directly or indirectly through a contractual relationship. This information includes pamphlets, newsletters, public library reports, etc.

For more information on accessible formats and communication supports please

go to the glossary, which gives a general description. For more detailed

information, go to Information and Communication Standard, Section 12,

“Accessible Formats and Communication Supports”.





Part 3 – Employment Standard



Overview

The Employment Standard, under the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation, requires employers to provide for accessibility across all stages of the employment life cycle.

By pro-actively removing barriers across the employment life cycle, employers can help to create workplaces that are accessible and which allow employees to reach their full potential.

The Employment Standard applies to paid employees. This includes, but is not limited to, full-time, part-time, paid apprenticeships and seasonal employment. As good business practice, employers may apply the Standard to unpaid staff, volunteers and other forms of unpaid work.

The Employment Standard is a framework for integrating accessibility into regular workplace processes.

Accessibility benefits everyone. Accessible employment processes mean that employers can access an untapped pool of talent. By providing accessible opportunities in the labour market, Ontario’s employment income may increase by $618 million.

Ontario Human Rights Code

The Ontario Human Rights Code requires organizations to accommodate people with disabilities to the point of undue hardship.

The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation does not replace or affect legal rights or obligations that arise under the Ontario Human Rights Code and other laws relating to the accommodation of people with disabilities. This means that the Ontario Human Rights Code or other applicable legislation may require additional accommodation measures that go beyond or are different from the standards established by the regulations of the AODA.





Requirements under the Employment Standard



The requirements covered in this section are:

 Recruitment, assessment and selection

 Accessible formats and communication supports for employees  Workplace emergency response information

 Documented individual accommodation plans

 Return to work process

Implementing the Requirement

On request, employers are required to consult with employees with disabilities to determine which accessible formats or communications supports they require. Not all accessible formats or communications supports are helpful to all persons who have disabilities. The accommodation need is as individual as the person is.

Once the employer and employee have determined what the needs are, then the organization must work out how to accommodate the person.

This requirement gives the employer the flexibility to decide on the most appropriate accessible formats or communications supports for the employee. That will depend on the needs of the employee with the disability and the capacity of the employer to provide the support.

For more information on accessible formats and communications supports,

please go to the glossary, which gives a general description. For more detailed

information, go to Information and Communication Standard, Section 12,

“Accessible Formats and Communications Supports”.

Workplace Information

This requirement applies to information that employees with disabilities need to perform their jobs effectively. For example, managers usually need to have a good working knowledge of their organizations’ human resources policies to hire, train and support staff.

The requirement also applies to information that is generally available in a workplace such as company newsletters, bulletins about company policies and fact sheets on health and safety information for workers. These may be provided in a variety of formats including the following:



 print



 email

 website

 staff notice boards

 verbally

Documenting Accessible Formats and Communications Supports

If an employee has an individual accommodation plan, then the accessible formats and/or communications supports that will be provided to the employee should be included in the plan.

For more information on individual accommodation plans, please go to

Employment Standard, Section 28, “Documented Individual Accommodation

Plans”.





Section 27



Workplace Emergency Response Information

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

27.(1) Every employer shall provide individualized workplace emergency response information to employees who have a disability, if the disability is such that the individualized information is necessary and the employer is aware of the need for accommodation due to the employee’s disability.

(2) If an employee who receives individualized workplace emergency response information requires assistance and with the employee’s consent, the employer shall provide the workplace emergency response information to the person designated by the employer to provide assistance to the employee.

(3) Employers shall provide the information required under this section as soon as practicable after the employer becomes aware of the need for accommodation due to the employee’s disability.

(4) Every employer shall review the individualized workplace emergency response information,

(a) when the employee moves to a different location in the

organization;

(b) when the employee’s overall accommodations needs or plans are

reviewed; and

(c) when the employer reviews its general emergency response

policies.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that all employers will prepare for the specific needs that employees with disabilities may have in emergency situations.

This requirement applies to all employers in Ontario with one or more employees.

Implementing the Requirement

Employers are required to prepare for emergency situations by providing employees with disabilities with individualized workplace emergency response information. This will help employees with disabilities, and the employers that they work for, to prepare for a range of potential emergencies including, but not limited to, the following:

 fire

 power outages

 severe weather

 natural disasters

 security incidents





When to Provide Individual Workplace Emergency Response Information



Employers are required to provide individualized workplace emergency response information under the following conditions.

 When the employee’s disability is such that the information is necessary; and  The employer is aware of the need for accommodation because of the

employee’s disability.

There are several ways that an employer may be made aware of the need to provide individualized workplace emergency response information:

 A new employee may have requested accommodations during the

recruitment process. For example, an applicant with a learning disability, such

as dyslexia, who requires more time to read interview questions.

 Existing employees tell their employers that they have a disability. For

example, an existing employee who develops vision loss and requests screen

reader software for his/her computer.

 An existing employee who develops a temporary disability such as a broken

leg.

Employers are not expected to provide individualized workplace emergency information for employees with disabilities of which they are unaware.

In most cases, employees with disabilities will tell their employers that they have a disability that requires accommodation. However, there may be other times where an employer may initiate a dialogue to offer assistance and accommodation to an employee who is clearly unwell or perceived to have a disability.

Developing Individual Workplace Emergency Response Information

It is important that employers recognize how an individual’s disability, as well as the physical nature of the workplace, may create unique challenges in emergency situations. For example:

 An employee who has a hearing disability may not hear an alarm and may

need to be notified by other means, such as a visual alarm with flashing

lights.  An employee with a visual disability may be unable to identify the escape



routes, or obstructions to the escape routes.



For these reasons and others, employers should consult with employees who have disabilities, so that the individualized workplace emergency response information meets the employees’ needs.

When an Employee Needs Assistance

Employees with disabilities may require assistance when evacuating the workplace in emergencies.

In these cases, and with the employees consent, the employer is required to provide the employees’ individualized workplace emergency response information to the designated individual(s).

Employers, however, need to respect their employees’ privacy. For co-workers to provide assistance, they do not need to know the details of the employees’ disabilities.

For example, an employee with limited mobility may need assistance walking down stairs. The person designated to help only needs to know the individual requires help walking down stairs. In other words, it is important to not include personal medical information in the individualized workplace emergency response information.

Reviewing Individualized Workplace Emergency Response Information

Employers are required to review the individualized workplace emergency response information to make sure it remains effective and up-to-date.

Employers must review this information under the following circumstances:

 When the employee moves to a different physical location in the organization.  When the employee’s overall accommodation needs or plans are reviewed.  When the employer reviews its general emergency response policies.

Employers may choose to review the information at other times. For instance, an employer may review the individualized workplace emergency response information if the existing response information was put to the test during an evacuation drill or a real emergency.



Documenting Individualized Workplace Emergency Response Information



If an employee has an individual accommodation plan, then the individualized workplace emergency response information provided to the employee should be included in the plan.

For more information on individual accommodation plans, please go to

Employment Standard, Section 28 “Documented Individual Accommodation

Plans”.





Section 28



Documented Individual Accommodation Plans

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

28.(1) Employers, other than employers that are small organizations, shall develop and have in place a written process for the development of documented individual accommodation plans for employees with disabilities.

(2) The process for the development of documented individual accommodation plans shall include the following elements:

1. The manner in which an employee requesting accommodation can

participate in the development of the individual accommodation plan.

2. The means by which the employee is assessed on an individual

basis.

3. The manner in which the employer can request an evaluation by an

outside medical or other expert, at the employer’s expense, to determine if and how accommodation can be achieved.

4. The manner in which the employee can request the participation of

a representative from their bargaining agent, where the employee is represented by a bargaining agent, or other representative from the workplace, where the employee is not represented by a bargaining agent, in the development of the accommodation plan.

5. The steps taken to protect the privacy of the employee’s personal

information.

6. The frequency with which the individual accommodation plan will be

Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

Government of Ontario and Legislative Assembly January 1, 2013

Designated public sector organizations with 50+ January 1, 2014 employees

Designated public sector organizations with 1-49 January 1, 2015 employees

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ January 1, 2016 employees

This requirement applies to employers, except small private and not-for-profit employers with 1-49 employees. Small private and not-for-profit employers are still required to accommodate the needs of employees with disabilities, to the point of undue hardship, under the Ontario Human Rights Code.



Implementing the Requirement



Under the Ontario Human Rights Code, employers are already required to accommodate the needs of employees with disabilities to the point of undue hardship. As a result, many employers may already have similar processes in place and can build on them to meet this requirement.

More information on accommodating employees with disabilities under the Ontario Human Rights Code can be found at:

http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/issues/employment

Under the Employment Standard, obligated employers are required to develop individual accommodation plans for employees with disabilities of which they have been made aware. In most cases, employees with disabilities will tell their employers that they have a disability that requires accommodation. However, there may be other times where an employer may initiate a dialogue to offer assistance and accommodation to an employee who is clearly unwell or perceived to have a disability.

Individual accommodation plans are a formal way of recording and reviewing the workplace-related accommodations that an employer will provide to an employee with a disability. Accommodation plans are living documents. They are reviewed and updated so that they remain effective and up-to-date.

This section requires obligated employers to develop a process to determine and document the accommodation needs of employees with disabilities.

By establishing a process for developing individual accommodation plans, employers should have in place a clear and consistent approach for accommodating employees with disabilities within their organization.

Under this requirement, employers have the flexibility to work with the employees in order for the employer to find appropriate accommodations.





Developing Individual Accommodation Plans



There are several steps to take when developing individual accommodation plans. These are a few of the key points to consider when developing them.

 How employees with disabilities can be involved in the development process

of their plans

 How employers can seek outside medical or other expert evaluation so that

they can provide effective supports

 What steps employers will take to protect the privacy of personal information  How frequently individual accommodation plans will be reviewed and

updated, and how this will be done

Important – Employers must remember that the information they collect to develop individual accommodation plans is private.

Why Reviews are Required

Reviewing individual accommodation plans will allow employers to consider what adjustments, if any, to the plans are required when changes occur. These changes could include the following:

 An employee changes jobs within the organization  An employee’s needs for accommodation change because of a recurring or

sporadic illness

 An employer’s policies and practices change

Additional Information for Individual Accommodation Plans

If applicable, individual accommodation plans must also include the employee’s workplace emergency response information and the accessible formats and communications supports that the employee requires. The plans must also include any other accommodations that the employee needs to do their job.

For more information on accessible formats or communications supports, please

go to the glossary, which gives a general description. For more detailed

information, Information and Communication Standard, Section 12, “Accessible

Formats and Communications Supports”.



For more information on workplace emergency response information, please go

Information”.





Section 29



Return to Work Process

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

29.(1) Every employer, other than an employer that is a small organization,

(a) shall develop and have in place a return to work process for its

employees who have been absent from work due to a disability and require disability-related accommodations in order to return to work; and

(b) shall document the process.

(2) The return to work process shall,

(a) outline the steps the employer will take to facilitate the return to

work of employees who were absent because their disability required them to be away from work; and

(b) use individual documented accommodation plans, as described in

section 28, as part of the process.

(3) The return to work process referenced in this section does not replace or override any other return to work process created by or under any other statute.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that employers will have in place a documented process for supporting employees who return to work after being away for reasons related to their disabilities.

If an individual’s illness or injury is covered by the return to work provisions of the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, then that Act’s return to work process would apply.

Small private and not-for-profit employers are still required to accommodate the needs of employees with disabilities, to the point of undue hardship, under the Ontario Human Rights Code.

Implementing the Requirement

Employers are required to develop return to work processes that document the steps they will take to help employees to return to work when:

 they have been absent because of their disability; and  they need some form of disability-related accommodation to return to work.

Return to work processes may be appropriate for employees who have permanent, recurring or temporary disabilities. For example, return to work accommodations may be appropriate when an employee:

 has a broken leg as a result a recreational accident  is undergoing treatment such a chemotherapy or radiation therapy  has episodes of mental illness  has a disease that results in an evolving or worsening disability, such as



multiple sclerosis



It is important is to determine whether some form of employment-related accommodation is required to allow the employee to effectively return to work.

Obligated employers are required to document their return-to-work processes so that they become part of their business practices and are applied consistently.

Employers have the flexibility to create return to work processes that best fit their existing organizational culture and business practices. For instance, some employers may already have return to work policies in place, which may meet this requirement or can be built upon to meet this requirement.

If an employee requires disability-related accommodation to effectively return to work, employers must develop an individual accommodation plan for that employee.

Employment Standard, Section 28, “Documented Individual Accommodation

Plans”.





Section 30



Performance Management

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

30.(1) An employer that uses performance management in respect of its employees shall take into account the accessibility needs of employees with disabilities, as well as individual accommodation plans, when using its performance management process in respect of employees with disabilities.

(2) In this section, “performance management” means activities related to assessing and improving employee performance, productivity and effectiveness, with the goal of facilitating employee success.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that all employers that use performance management processes will take into account the accessibility needs of employees with disabilities.

This requirement applies to employers with one or more employees that have performance management processes in place.



Implementing the Requirement



Employers that have performance management processes in place are required to consider the accessibility needs of employees with disabilities in these processes.

Performance management processes may be informal or formal and will vary from employer to employer. For instance, small employers may engage in informal conversations with employees about their performance on the job. Larger employers, however, may have human resource departments that develop and oversee formal performance management processes.

There are many ways in which employers can take into account the accessibility needs of employees with disabilities in their performance management processes. For example, employers can:

 Review an employee’s individual accommodation plan to understand the

employee’s accommodation needs and determine whether it needs adjusting

to improve his or her performance on the job.

 Have documents related to performance management, such as performance

plans, available in accessible formats, such as large print for individuals with

low vision.

 Provide informal and formal coaching and feedback in a manner that takes

into account an employee’s disability, such as using plain language for an

individual with a learning disability.

What is Performance Management?

Many employers have annual performance reviews or other performance management processes, which can result in an employee’s responsibilities changing. If the employee has a disability, then the employer must revisit the employee’s individual accommodation plan to see if any adjustments are required.

For more information on individual accommodation plans, please see,

Employment Standard, Section 28, “Documented Individual Accommodation

Plans”.





Section 31



Career Development and Advancement

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

31.(1) An employer that provides career development and advancement to its employees shall take into account the accessibility needs of its employees with disabilities as well as any individual accommodation plans, when providing career development and advancement to its employees with disabilities.

(2)In this section, “career development and advancement” includes providing additional responsibilities within an employee’s current position and the movement of an employee from one job to another in an organization that may be higher in pay, provide greater responsibility or be at a higher level in the organization or any combination of them and, for both additional responsibilities and employee movement, is usually based on merit or seniority, or a combination of them.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that employers that provide career development and advancement opportunities will take into account the accessibility needs of their employees who have disabilities. This may provide employees with disabilities with the opportunities to advance within their organizations.

This requirement applies to all employers with one or more employees that provide career development and advancement to their employees.

Implementing the Requirement

Although an employee with a disability may be accommodated to perform a specific role, the employer may have other opportunities for which the employee may be well-suited.

When providing career development and advancement opportunities, employers are required to take into account what accommodations employees with disabilities may need to succeed elsewhere in their organizations or to take on new responsibilities in their current position.

For example, an employee may receive a promotion, which includes new responsibilities. In this case, the employer and employee may review the individual accommodation plan to learn what adjustments may be needed for the new responsibilities.

Career Development and Advancement and Individual Accommodation Plans

When employers provide career development and advancement opportunities to their employees, they must take into account the individual accommodation plans that are in place for their employees with disabilities.

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

32.(1) An employer that uses redeployment shall take into account the accessibility needs of its employees with disabilities, as well as individual accommodation plans, when redeploying employees with disabilities.

(2) In this section, “redeployment” means the reassignment of employees to other departments or jobs within the organization as an alternative to layoff, when a particular job or department has been eliminated by the organization.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that all employers that use redeployment processes will consider the accessibility needs of employees with disabilities when moving them to other positions, so that employees can continue to have their accommodation needs met.

employees

This requirement applies to all employers in Ontario with one or more employees. Implementing the Requirement



Employers that use redeployment are required to take into account the accessibility needs of employees with disabilities. This includes reviewing individual accommodation plans when moving employees with disabilities to other jobs within their organizations.



Large employers that have restructured, downsized or merged with other employers often redeploy their employees to other jobs. Many of these employers have redeployment policies in place and human resources departments to oversee them.

The regulation does not require employers to create new processes for redeployment. It does require employers that redeploy employees to consider the accessibility needs of individuals with disabilities and, if required, adjust their supports to fit their new roles.

By considering the accessibility needs of individuals with disabilities when redeploying employees, employers may help these employees continue to contribute effectively.

For example, if an employee with a disability has a modified cubicle or special software on their computer, then these accommodations may follow the employee to the new position or are reassessed to determine if they still meet the employee’s disability-related needs.

Redeployment and Individual Accommodation Plans

When organizations redeploy employees, they must take into account the individual accommodation plans that are in place for their employees with disabilities, they should refer to their Individual Accommodation Plans and determine what modifications may be needed to accommodate them in their new jobs.

For more information on individual accommodation plans, please see,

Employment Standard, Section 28, “Documented Individual Accommodation

Plans”.





Part 4 – Transportation Standard



Overview

For example, the support person may help the person with a disability board the vehicle, pay the fare or provide personal care when travelling.



Demonstrating the Need for a Support Person



A person with a disability who requires a support person while travelling must demonstrate the need to the conventional transportation service provider or the specialized transportation service provider. How the person with a disability demonstrates this need is at the discretion of each provider.

Giving the Designation

The designation that allows a support person to travel without paying a fare is given to the person with a disability. It is not given to the support person.

This provision recognizes that a person with a disability has the need for a support person, not the need for a specific support person. Further, a person with a disability may use more than one support person for travelling over the course of a week, a month or a year.

Section 40



Transition — Existing Vehicles

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

40 (1) Conventional transportation service providers are not required to retrofit vehicles that are within their fleet as of July 1, 2011 in order to ensure that the vehicles meet the accessibility requirements of sections 53 to 62.

(2) If a conventional transportation service provider modifies a portion of a vehicle to which subsection (1) applies in a way that affects or could affect accessibility on or after July 1, 2011, the transportation service provider shall ensure that the modified portion meets the requirements of sections 53 to 62.

(3) Where subsection (2) applies and the modification is with respect to matters referred to in section 53, 55, 57 or 61 or subsection 62 (2), the conventional transportation service provider does not have to meet the requirements of those provisions if the modifications would impair the structural integrity of the vehicle or the mobility aid accessible rail car.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is to exempt conventional transportation service providers from retrofitting their fleet while ensuring that new acquisitions meet the technical requirements of this regulation.

When do Organizations have to Comply

This requirement applies to all conventional transportation service providers. It is a transitional requirement, and does not have a compliance date.

Implementing the Requirement

No Retrofit Requirement

Conventional transportation service providers are not required to retrofit the vehicles that are in their fleets as of July 1, 2011 to meet the technical requirements in the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation. The regulation applies on a go-forward basis to purchases of new and used vehicles. A vehicle is considered to be in the fleet of a transportation service provider if the vehicle was owned by the provider on or before June 30, 2011.



Requirements Regarding Modifications/Upgrades



On or after July 1, 2011, if a conventional transportation service provider modifies or upgrades a portion of a vehicle, the new features must meet the accessibility requirements outlined in the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation.

This requirement applies to any modifications or upgrades to the vehicles or their equipment that fall under the technical requirements of the regulation.

Example: In September 2011, a conventional transportation service provider decides to upgrade its bus fleet by replacing all the signage. These new signs must meet the requirements for signage outlined in the regulation. The conventional transportation service provider, however, is not required to retrofit other parts of the bus fleet such as the steps or lighting to meet the requirements of the regulation. Only those parts of the bus fleet that the provider changes have to meet the requirements.

Exemption

Structural Integrity

Conventional transportation service providers are not required to meet the technical requirements in the regulation under the following circumstances:

 When upgrades to the requirements in the regulation compromise or harm the

structural integrity of a vehicle.

 When upgrades to the requirements in the regulation compromise or harm the

structural integrity of a rail car that is accessible to people with disabilities who

use mobility aids.

Example: A conventional transportation service provider has decided to upgrade the grab bars, handholds, handrails and stanchions in all its commuter trains. The upgrade will replace the worn padding. The provider is not required to meet the accessibility requirements for the placement of handrails, grab bars, handholds and stanchions if doing so would harm the structural integrity of the vehicles.

There are five requirements that are eligible for the structural integrity exemption:  grab bars, handholds, handrails and stanchions



 allocated mobility aid spaces



 lighting features

 indicators and alarms

 mobility aid accessible washrooms on rail cars

For more information about these requirements, please go to Transportation,

Section 53, “Grab Bars, Handhold, Handrails, Stanchions”; Section 55, “Allocated

Mobility Aid Spaces”; Section 57, “Lighting Features”; Section 61, “Indicators and

Alarms”; and, Section 62, “Rail Cars”.





Section 41

When do Organizations Have to Comply

This requirement applies to conventional transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2013.





Implementing the Requirement



Customer Feedback

Conventional transportation service providers must identify their processes for managing, evaluating and acting on customer feedback.

Customer feedback gives the conventional transportation service providers the chance to learn about the concerns of people with disabilities and about the obstacles they face when using transportation services.

The feedback also allows people with disabilities to respond to advances and improvements in accessibility.

Determining customer satisfaction will help conventional transportation service providers to steadily improve their equipment and services for people with disabilities.

Public Meetings

Conventional transportation service providers must hold at least one annual public meeting that includes and involves people with disabilities.

These meetings will give conventional transportation service providers opportunities to receive customer feedback on their accessibility plans.

The meetings will also make sure that people with disabilities can participate in the annual reviews of accessibility plans.

There is no requirement that these meetings must be for the sole purpose of receiving feedback on accessibility plans. Conventional transportation service providers may also choose to seek feedback on other issues relating to accessibility during the meetings.

Providers of both Conventional and Specialized Services

If the conventional transportation service provider also provides specialized transportation services, then it must address both types of transportation services in its accessibility plan.

This recognizes that one accessibility plan for both types of services benefits staff members and people with disabilities. Other Accessibility Plan Requirements



Conventional transportation service providers have other accessibility plan requirements under the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation.



For more information on accessibility plans, go to General Requirements, Section

4, “Accessibility Plans”.





Section 42



Accessibility Plans — Specialized Transportation Services

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

42 (1) Specialized transportation service providers shall, in their accessibility plans,

(a) identify the process for estimating the demand for specialized transportation services; and

(b) develop steps to reduce wait times for specialized transportation services.

(2) Specialized transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2013.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that specialized transportation service providers will identify, in their accessibility plan, how they will estimate the demand for specialized transportation. They will also outline what steps they will take to reduce the waiting times for their services.

When do Organizations have to Comply

This requirement applies to specialized transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2013.

Implementing the Requirement

Estimating Demand

Within their multi-year accessibility plans, specialized transportation service providers must identify the processes they plan to use to estimate the demand for specialized transportation services in their jurisdictions.

Estimating demand will assist specialized transportation service providers to align their services to better match the demand.





Reducing Waiting Times



Within the multi-year accessibility plans, specialized transportation service providers must outline the steps they will take to reduce the wait times for their services. This is the time that people with disabilities spend waiting for scheduled pick-ups by specialized transportation vehicles. It does not refer to waiting times during the process to determine an individual’s eligibility for specialized transportation services.

Other Accessibility Plan Requirements

Specialized transportation service providers have other accessibility plan requirements under the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation.

For more information on accessibility plans, go to General Requirements, Section

4, “Accessibility Plans”.





Section 43

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that conventional transportation service providers will assist people with disabilities.

When do Organizations have to Comply

This requirement applies to conventional transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2012.



Implementing the Requirement



Conventional transportation service providers are required to assist people with disabilities in the following situations.

Using Ramps, Bridge Plates and Lifts

When requested, operators must deploy or put in place the ramps, portable bridge plates or lifting devices that are used to help people with disabilities board or deboard vehicles.

This requirement does not apply to those vehicles, such as subways, that do not have lifting devices, ramps or portable bridge plates.

Providing Adequate Time

Operators must provide enough time for people with disabilities to safely board and deboard the vehicles, as well as to secure mobility aids. Operators must also provide assistance for these activities, when requested.

For those vehicles with no securement devices, such as subway cars, the requirement to secure mobility aids does not apply.

Note: This requirement does not exempt operators from any other specific responsibilities required by conventional transportation service providers as outlined in other legislation or policies regarding safety.

Safe Storage of Mobility Aids and Mobility Assistive Devices

Operators must help safely store the mobility aids or mobility assistive devices used by people with disabilities.

This is required when storage space is available on the vehicle, and if the person with the disability does not require the mobility aid or the mobility assistive device while on the vehicle.

Mobility aids and mobility assistive devices are safely stored when they are secure and cannot move in such a way that they would be damaged or that they trip or harm other passengers.





Allowing Medical Aids



Operators must allow people with disabilities to travel with medical aids such as respirators and portable oxygen supplies.

Ensuring Safety

The requirements outlined in this section do not supersede the rights of operators regarding their personal safety or the safety of other passengers as outlined in the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

Providing Accessible Information

If requested, conventional transportation service providers must provide information about the responsibilities of their operators in accessible formats.

For more information on accessible formats, please go to the Glossary, which gives a general description. For more detailed information, go to Information and

Communications Standard, Section 12, “Accessible Formats and Communication

Supports”.





Section 45



Alternative Accessible Method of Transportation

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

45 (1) Except where not practicable to do so, a conventional transportation service provider that does not provide specialized transportation services shall ensure that any person with a disability who, because of his or her disability, is unable to use conventional transportation services is provided with an alternative accessible method of transportation.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply where specialized transportation services are provided by a specialized transportation service provider in the same jurisdiction where the conventional transportation service provider provides transportation services.

(3) Conventional transportation service providers shall comply with the requirements of this section by January 1, 2013.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that conventional transportation service providers offer people with disabilities an alternative accessible method of transportation if they cannot use conventional transportation services as a result of their disability, and if there is no specialized transportation service in the area.

When do Organizations have to Comply

This requirement applies to conventional transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2013.

Implementing the Requirement

Alternative Accessible Method of Transportation

Conventional transportation service providers that do not provide specialized transportation services must provide people with disabilities, who cannot use the conventional service, with an alternative accessible method of transportation. This requirement applies under the following circumstances:

 When there is no specialized transportation service available in the area.  The person with a disability cannot use the conventional service because of



his or her disability and not for other reasons, such as lack of adequate funds



or the schedules are inconvenient.

This requirement does not mean that conventional transportation service providers must create a separate and dedicated specialized service. The requirement means that people with disabilities are provided with alternative accessible transportation.

Exemptions

In some cases, there may be a specialized transportation service available in the municipality or region. In this situation, the conventional transportation service provider does not have to offer an alternate accessible method of transportation as an accessible service is available from another source or provider.

In other cases, it may not be practicable for conventional transportation service providers to provide alternative accessible transportation to people with disabilities. In these cases, the provider is not required to do so.

Example: A person with a disability is discharged from the hospital and requires transportation from the hospital to his home. His disability requires that he be transported on a gurney. In this situation, the conventional transportation service provider may not be required to provide an alternative accessible method of transportation as even a typical specialized transportation vehicle cannot be used to transport a person on a gurney.

What is being requested here is a special type of trip, not a comparable accessible alternative. In this case, it is the responsibility of the person with a disability to arrange transportation that accommodates his or her unique needs.





Section 46



Fares

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

46 (1) No conventional transportation service provider shall charge a higher fare to a person with a disability than the fare that is charged to a person without a disability where the person with a disability uses conventional transportation services, but a conventional transportation service provider may charge a lesser fare for a person with a disability.

(2) Conventional transportation service providers that do not provide specialized transportation services shall make available alternative fare payment options to persons with disabilities who cannot, because of their disability, use a fare payment option.

(3) Conventional transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of subsection (1) by July 1, 2011 and the requirements of subsection (2) by January 1, 2013.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that no conventional transportation service provider will charge people with disabilities more than people without disabilities for the same trip.

In addition, conventional transportation service providers must offer accessible fare payment options.

When do Organizations have to Comply

Conventional transportation service providers must comply with the fare portion of the requirement by July 1, 2011.

Conventional transportation service providers must comply with the requirement for accessible fare payment options by January 1, 2013.





Implementing the Requirement



Fares

A conventional transportation service provider cannot charge people with disabilities higher fares than it charges people without disabilities for the same trip.

Conventional transportation service providers, however, are allowed to charge people with disabilities lower fares than those charged to people without disabilities.

Accessible Fare Payment Options

Conventional transportation service providers that do not provide specialized transportation services must have alternative accessible options for paying fares for people with disabilities, who because of their disabilities cannot use the commonly used methods for paying fares.

Example: Some people with disabilities may have trouble placing coins or tokens into fare boxes, while others may have problems with the machines used for purchasing tickets. Conventional transportation service providers must remove these barriers to their services by offering accessible options for paying fares.





Section 47



Transit Stops

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

47(1) Conventional transportation service providers, in respect of transportation vehicles to which this section applies, shall ensure that persons with disabilities are able to board or deboard a transportation vehicle at the closest available safe location, as determined by the operator, that is not an official stop, if the official stop is not accessible and the safe location is along the same transit route.

(2) In determining where a safe location may be situated for the purposes of subsection (1), the conventional transportation service provider shall give consideration to the preferences of the person with a disability.

(3) Conventional transportation service providers shall ensure that operators of their transportation vehicles promptly report to an appropriate authority where a transit stop is temporarily inaccessible or where a temporary barrier exists.

(4) This section applies in respect of the following:

1. Transit buses.

2. Motor coaches.

3. Streetcars.

(5) Conventional transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2012.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that when official stops are not accessible, conventional transportation service providers will allow people with disabilities to board and deboard the vehicles at safe locations that are not official stops.





Table 26 - When do Organizations have to Comply





Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

Conventional transportation service providers. January 1, 2012

Applies to the following vehicles:

 transit buses

 motor coaches

 streetcars



Implementing the Requirement

Who Decides

When official transit stops have barriers or are not accessible, conventional transportation service providers must allow people with disabilities to board or deboard their vehicles at the closest safe location.

It is the operators of the vehicles who will decide what is the closest and safest place to stop, taking into consideration the preferences of the person with the disability.

Operators must also take into account two other factors:

 The unofficial stop must be on the same transit route.  The operators of the vehicles must be able to safely operate any accessibility

equipment required by people with disabilities to board or deboard the

vehicles.

What vehicles

This requirement only applies to conventional transportation service providers that operate transit buses, motor coaches, and streetcars. These vehicles, unlike subways, are not required to stop at every official transit stop. Streetcars, transit buses and motor coaches only stop when there are people waiting at the stops who want to board or people on the vehicles who want to get off.



Barriers



Conventional transportation service providers must make sure that their operators of transit buses, motor coaches and streetcars report transit stops that are temporarily inaccessible.

Operators must promptly report inaccessible transit stops, to the appropriate authority when they determine that there is a barrier at a stop. For example, they may call over the radio, or they may tell their supervisors at the end of their shifts or when they return to their stations. The appropriate authority could be, for example, the transportation service provider or the municipality.

Example: An operator of a transit bus notices a large crack in the sidewalk in front of the transit stop. The operator decides to stop the bus several metres away from the official transit stop so that people with disabilities can board and deboard safely.





Section 48



Storage of Mobility Aids And Mobility Assistive Devices

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

48(1) Every conventional transportation service provider shall, if safe storage is possible, ensure that mobility aids and mobility assistive devices are stored in the passenger compartments of its transportation vehicles within reach of the person with the disability who uses the aid or device.

(2) If safe storage of mobility aids and mobility assistive devices is not possible within the passenger compartment and the vehicle is equipped with a baggage compartment, a conventional transportation service provider shall ensure that mobility aids and mobility assistive devices are stored in the baggage compartment of the vehicle on which the person with the disability is travelling.

(3) Every conventional transportation service provider shall ensure that operators of its transportation vehicles secure and return mobility aids and mobility assistive devices in a manner that does not affect the safety of other passengers and does not cause damage to the aid or device, where the mobility aid or mobility assistive device is stored in the baggage compartment of the vehicle.

(4) No conventional transportation service provider shall charge a fee for the storage of a mobility aid or a mobility assistive device.

(5) This section applies in respect of the following:

1. Transit buses.

2. Motor coaches.

3. Streetcars.

4. Subways.

5. Light rail.

6. Commuter rail.

7. Inter-city rail. (6) Subject to subsection (7), conventional transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2012.



(7) Conventional transportation service providers shall comply with subsection (4) by July 1, 2011.



Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that conventional transportation service providers will store and return mobility aids and mobility assistive devices to people with disabilities who use them.

This requirement does not allow conventional transportation service providers to charge fees for storing mobility aids and mobility assistive devices.

Table 27 - When do Organizations have to Comply

 motor coaches

 street cars

 subways

 light rail

 commuter rail

 inter-city rail



Implementing this Requirement



Storage in Passenger Compartments

In some vehicles, the passenger compartments have areas where mobility aids and mobility assistive devices can be stored safely. If this is the case, then conventional transportation service providers must make sure that mobility aids and mobility assistive devices are stored within reach of the people with disabilities who use them. For example, a walker may be placed beside the passenger who uses it or at her feet.

Storing in Baggage Compartments

In other vehicles, the baggage compartments are the only places where mobility aids or mobility assistive devices can be stored safely.

In these cases, conventional transportation service providers must make sure that mobility aids and mobility assistive devices are stored on the same vehicles on which the people with disabilities are travelling.

When conventional transportation service providers use the baggage compartments to store mobility aids or mobility assistive devices, they must be safely secured. Further, they must be returned to the people with disabilities in a manner that does not affect the safety of the other passengers or damage the aids or devices.

Note: This requirement does not require a dedicated location for storage. Conventional transportation service providers are not required to have or to dedicate separate storage areas if the vehicles do not have them already. Safe storage could simply involve placing the devices beside people with disabilities or at their feet.

Charging Fees

Conventional transportation service providers cannot charge fees for storing mobility aids or mobility assistive devices.

This applies when mobility aids or mobility assistive devices are stored in passenger compartments or in baggage compartments.





Section 49



Courtesy Seating

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

49(1) Every conventional transportation service provider shall ensure that there is clearly marked courtesy seating for persons with disabilities on its transportation vehicles and that the courtesy seating meets the standards set out in this section.

(2) The courtesy seating for persons with disabilities shall be located as close as practicable to the entrance door of the vehicle.

(3) The courtesy seating for persons with disabilities shall be signed to indicate that passengers, other than persons with disabilities, must vacate the courtesy seating if its use is required by a person with a disability.

(4) Every conventional transportation service provider shall develop a communications strategy designed to inform the public about the purpose of courtesy seating.

(5) This section applies in respect of the following:

1. Transit buses.

2. Motor coaches.

3. Streetcars.

4. Subways.

5. Light rail.

6. Commuter rail.

7. Inter-city rail.

(6) Conventional transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2012.



Intent of this Requirement



The intent of this requirement is that conventional transportation service providers will have seats that are designated for people with disabilities and are located as close as practicable to the entrance door.

Further, conventional transportation service providers will develop communications strategies to inform the public about the purpose of these seats.

Table 28 - When do Organizations Have to Comply

Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

Conventional transportation service providers January 1, 2012.

Applies to following vehicles:

 transit buses

 motor coaches

 street cars

 subways

 light rail

 commuter rail

 inter-city rail





Implementing the Requirement



Clearly Marked Seating

Conventional transportation service providers must make sure that each of their vehicles has seating that is clearly marked as intended for people with disabilities.

The style or symbol used to mark the seating is up to the conventional transportation service provider. But, they must make sure that the signs for the seats tell people without disabilities that they have to leave these seats when they are needed by people with disabilities.

Operators are not required to ask people without disabilities to vacate seats for people with disabilities.

Note: Some conventional transportation service providers may have “courtesy” or “priority” seating for seniors, expectant mothers, or passengers with small children. These providers are not required to eliminate this seating for other passengers in need, but are required to have seating specifically designated for people with disabilities.

Location

Seating for people with disabilities must be accessible and located as close as practicable to the entrances of the vehicles.

If the closest seats to the entrance door are not accessible or would pose a barrier to people with disabilities then they — the seats — are not practical and should not be designated as seating for people with disabilities. Instead the conventional transportation service provider should designate seats which are accessible and as close as practicable to the entrance doors.

Communications Strategy

Conventional transportation service providers must develop a communications strategy to inform the public about the purpose of this seating for people with disabilities.





Section 50



Service Disruptions

Requirement as stated in the Regulation

50(1) Where a route or scheduled service is temporarily changed and the change is known in advance of the commencement of the trip, conventional transportation service providers shall,

(a) make available alternate accessible arrangements to transfer persons with disabilities to their route destination where alternate arrangements for persons without disabilities are inaccessible; and

(b) ensure information on alternate arrangements is communicated in a manner that takes into account the person’s disability.

(2) This section applies in respect of the following:

1. Transit buses.

2. Motor coaches.

3. Streetcars.

4. Subways.

5. Light rail.

6. Commuter rail.

7. Inter-city rail.

(3) Conventional transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by July 1, 2013.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that when conventional transportation service providers know of a service disruption in advance, they will make alternative arrangements for accessible transportation for people with disabilities. The providers will also make sure the arrangements are communicated to people with disabilities in an accessible format.



Table 29 - When do Organizations have to Comply



Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

Conventional transportation service providers July 1, 2013

Applies to the following vehicles:

 motor coaches

 street cars

 subways

 light rail

 commuter rail

 inter-city travel.



Implementing the Requirement

Route Changes Known in Advance

When conventional transportation service providers know of a route or scheduled service change in advance of the start of the trip, they are required to arrange for accessible transportation to get people with disabilities to their route destinations if the alternative arrangement for people without disabilities is not accessible.

The following are examples of temporary route or scheduled service changes that are known in advance.

 A bus detours because streets have been closed for a summer street festival.  Repairs at a subway station mean the subway will not stop there for a day.  The commuter train will arrive on Platform B instead of Platform A.



The following are examples of temporary route or scheduled service changes that are unexpected:



 A car accident means that buses must take a detour and miss four official

transit stops on the regular route.

 A flood from a water-main break requires the subways to run through a

station without stopping.

 Rail blockade requires commuter trains to stop and stay put on route.

In the event of a service disruption, this requirement does not guarantee that people with disabilities can get to a specific location at their intended destination.

For example, if a section of a road is closed down because of a police investigation, then the conventional transportation service provider cannot guarantee that a person with a disability will get to a bank that is located in the blocked off area.

Accessible Information

Conventional transportation service providers are required to make sure that the information on alternative arrangements is communicated in a manner that takes into account the person’s disability.

Verbal Requirements

Conventional transportation service providers must make sure that all destination points or stops are audibly announced on board their vehicles while they are travelling.

This requirement does not apply if the vehicle is empty or if the information is provided electronically through automated announcements.

Electronic Requirements

Conventional transportation service providers must make sure that all destination points or stops are electronically announced on board their vehicles while they are travelling.

The information must be announced over automated announcement systems, and legibly displayed electronically.

For example, the next stop of “Queen Street” must be audibly communicated through an electronic system, as well as legibly displayed on an electronic system. This means that passengers have the option of reading or hearing “Queen Street”.

Sections 53 – 62



Conventional Transportation Service Providers – Technical Requirements

Overview

The following 10 sections relate to the technical requirements for vehicles regulated under the Accessible Transportation Standard:

 section 53 grab bars, handholds, handrails and stanchions  section 54 floors and carpeted surfaces

 section 55 allocated mobility aid spaces

 section 56 stop requests and emergency response controls  section 57 lighting features

 section 58 signage

 section 59 lifting devices, ramps, or portable bridge plates  section 60 steps

 section 61 indicators and alarms

 section 62 rail cars

The first nine sections (53 – 60) apply to the following vehicles operated by conventional transportation service providers:

 transit buses

 motor coaches

 streetcars

 subways

 light rail

 commuter rail

 inter-city rail.

As a general rule, the requirements under sections 53 – 61 apply to vehicles manufactured on or after January 1, 2013.

However, these requirements also apply to vehicles manufactured before January 1, 2013. If a conventional transportation service provider enters into a contract to purchase a vehicle on or after July 1, 2011, then that vehicle must also meet the technical requirements of the regulation. Please refer to each section for details.



Section 62 applies to the following vehicles operated by conventional transportation service providers:



 light rail

 commuter rail

 inter-city rail.

As with the other technical requirements, as a general rule Section 62 applies to rail cars manufactured on or after January 1, 2013. However, if a conventional transportation service provider enters into a contract on or after July 1, 2011 to purchase a rail car, then the requirement also applies to that rail car. Please refer

to Section 62 for more details.

Examples of how technical requirements may apply to vehicles manufactured before January 1, 2013

On October 3, 2011, a conventional transportation service provider buys two used streetcars. Before those two streetcars may be put into service, they must meet the same technical requirements as those set out for vehicles manufactured on or after January 1, 2013.

On June 3, 2012, a conventional transportation service provider orders one new transit bus from a manufacturer who can have it ready before January 1, 2013. Before the transit bus can be put into service, it must meet the same technical requirements as those set out for vehicles manufactured on or after January 1, 2013.

On November 8, 2011, a conventional transportation service provider ordered one new rail car from a manufacturer who was able to complete the manufacturing before January 1, 2013. Before this rail car can be put into service, it must meet the accessible washroom requirements set out for rail cars manufactured on or after January 1, 2013.

Location

Accessible controls must be located throughout the vehicle, including places within reach of allocated mobility aid spaces and courtesy seating locations.

It is not necessary to have a control for each seating location and standing location. However, the controls must be within reach of allocated mobility aid spaces and courtesy seating locations. This will allow people with disabilities, whose ability or range of motion may be limited, to reach the stop request buttons and the emergency response controls more easily.

Both stop requests and emergency response controls are not required in all vehicles. For example, a subway does not require stop request controls, as a subway must stop at all stops, whereas a streetcar does require a stop request control. Additionally, a transit bus does not require emergency response controls,





as operators are easily notified of emergencies on board.



Accessible Control Standards

Accessible stop-requests and emergency response controls must meet the following standards.

Auditory and Visual Indicators

They must provide both auditory and visual indications that the request has been made so that people with a range of disabilities are aware of the request.

Location

They must be located no higher than 1220 millimetres and no lower than 380 millimetres above the floor to allow for access and to allow people with disabilities to independently activate the controls.

Operation

They must be able to be operated with one hand, and not require tight grasping, pinching or twisting of the wrist, to assist people with disabilities who have difficulty with arm or hand movements.

Colour Contrast

They must be high colour-contrasted with the equipment on which the controls are mounted so that they are easily identified from the surrounding material, or the objects on which they are placed.

Tactile Information

Emergency response controls must include tactile information. Tactile refers to raised lettering or Braille, used to communicate the purpose of the control to people with visual disabilities or low vision.

Implementing the Requirement



The general rule for the technical requirements is that they apply to vehicles manufactured on or after January 1, 2013.

However, the technical requirements also apply to vehicles manufactured before January 1, 2013. If a conventional transportation service provider enters into a contract to purchase a vehicle on or after July 1, 2011, then that vehicle must also meet the technical requirements of the regulation.

Lighting Requirements

Conventional transportation service providers must make sure that all of their transportation vehicles are equipped with lights above or beside each passenger door.

The lights must be lit constantly when the doors are open, and illuminate the lifting devices, ramps, portable bridge plates or step nosings, as the case may be.

Some vehicles will have none of these assistive devices, and some vehicles may have more than one of them.

Ground Level Lighting

When a passenger access door is open, the lights located above or beside each door must illuminate the ground surface for a distance of at least 0.9 metres perpendicular to the tread on the bottom step or the outer edge of the lift.

Ground surface could be the road, sidewalk, station platform, or whatever surface a passenger would deboard onto.

The ground level lighting will help passengers see the bottom step or the edge of the lift when they are boarding a vehicle, and to see the ground in front of them when they are exiting a vehicle.

Protecting from Glare

The lights located above or beside each passenger access door must be shielded to protect the eyes of passengers as they enter and exit the vehicle. When lights are not shielded, passengers can be temporarily blinded as they board and deboard the vehicles, which could cause disorientation, tripping, etc.



For example, a light located on or near the floor should not be angled upward in a way that it is a hazard to passengers. An overhead light should not be angled so that it is at eye level when passengers are exiting the vehicle.



Exemptions

Structural Integrity

Conventional transportation service providers who purchase a new or used vehicle (to which the general rule respecting the January 1, 2013 manufacture date does not apply) on or after July 1, 2011 do not have to meet the requirements pertaining to lighting if their installation would impair the structural integrity of the vehicle.

 inter-city rail.



Implementing the Requirement

The general rule for the technical requirements is that they apply to vehicles manufactured on or after January 1, 2013.

However, the technical requirements also apply to vehicles manufactured before January 1, 2013. If a conventional transportation service provider enters into a contract to purchase a vehicle on or after July 1, 2011, then that vehicle must also meet the technical requirements of the regulation.

Signage Information

All conventional transportation service providers must make sure that all of their transportation vehicles display the route or direction of the vehicle or its destination or next major stop.

Examples:

 #36 North

 Queen Street to King Street

 Ottawa Express

Signage Requirements and Characteristics

Consistency in signage will help people with disabilities recognize the transportation vehicle they are looking for or intending to board. This is especially important along routes served by more than one vehicle, which travel to different destinations





Signage must include all of the following components:



The signs must be visible at the boarding point.

 The boarding point refers to the area on a vehicle where passengers board

and deboard.

 Signs at the boarding point alert people with disabilities of the route or

direction of the vehicle.

The signs must be consistently located

 The signage may be to the right, left, or above the boarding point, as long as

its location is consistent among those types of vehicles.

 When signs are placed in the same place, people with disabilities know where

to look for and to find the information.

For example, the local city bus service has electronic signs displaying bus destinations above the window adjacent to the passenger access door on each vehicle.

The signs must have a glare-free surface.

 A glare-free surface is a surface that does not easily reflect light from the sun

or artificial lights which can make it difficult to see or read a sign.

 A glare-free surface makes it easier to see and read what is written on it.  A glare free surface is based on the material used or how the surface is

treated.

The signs must be positioned to avoid shadow areas and glare.

 The exact position of a sign to avoid glare and shadows will vary depending

on the type of vehicle.

 Avoiding shadow areas and glare on the signs will help people with

disabilities to properly identify the information on the sign, regardless of the

time of day or weather conditions.





The signs must be easy to find and to read



 Signage must be consistently shaped, coloured and positioned, when used in

the same type of transportation vehicle to give the same type of information.

 For example, all commuter trains in a fleet have a horizontal sign

above each entrance door that tells of the final destination of the train, and include a yellow text over a black background.

 The text must be high colour-contrasted with its background, such as the wall

or the frame on which the sign is mounted, or in the case of electronic

signage, the background would be the screen colour as distinct from the text

colour.

 The text must be in solid characters. Solid characters means that the letters

and numbers are filled in, as opposed to hollow, and do not have shadows.

Pictograms or symbols

Signage may include pictograms or symbols, in order to provide greater clarity to people with disabilities.

A pictogram refers to a pictorial resemblance to a physical object, for example, a picture of a ferry with an arrow, indicating the entrance to the ferry.

59(1) Every conventional transportation service provider shall ensure that all of its transportation vehicles manufactured on or after January 1, 2013 to which this section applies are equipped with lifting devices, ramps or portable bridge plates and that each of them has,

(a) a colour strip that runs its full width marking the bottom edge and that is high colour-contrasted with its background to assist with visual recognition;

(b) a slip resistant platform surface; and

(c) raised edges of sufficient height to prevent a mobility aid from rolling off the edge of the ramp during the boarding or deboarding of passengers.

(2) This section applies in respect of the following:

1. Transit buses.

2. Motor coaches.

3. Streetcars.

4. Subways.

5. Light rail.

6. Commuter rail.

7. Inter-city rail.

(3) Despite subsection (2), this section does not apply to vehicles that are equipped with lifting devices, ramps or portable bridge plates and that are regulated under Regulation 629 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1990 (Vehicles for the Transportation of Physically Disabled Passengers) made under the Highway Traffic Act. (4) Despite subsection (1), where a conventional transportation service provider enters into a contractual obligation to purchase new or used vehicles of the type referenced in subsection (2) on or after July 1, 2011, the transportation service provider shall ensure the vehicles meet the requirements of this section.



The Intent of this Requirement



The intent of this requirement is that all conventional transportation vehicles are equipped with lifting devices, ramps, or portable bridge plates to help people with disabilities board and deboard the vehicles.

Table 38 - When do Organizations have to Comply

Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

Conventional transportation service providers Applies to vehicles

manufactured on or after

Applies to the following vehicles: January 1, 2013.

 transit buses

 motor coaches

 streetcars

 subways

 light rail

 commuter rail

 inter-city rail.



Implementing the Requirement

The general rule for the technical requirements is that they apply to vehicles manufactured on or after January 1, 2013. However, the technical requirements also apply to vehicles manufactured before January 1, 2013. If a conventional transportation service provider enters into a contract to purchase a vehicle on or after July 1, 2011, then that vehicle must also meet the technical requirements of the regulation.



Conventional transportation service providers must make sure that all of their transportation vehicles are equipped with lifting devices, ramps, or portable bridge plates.



Lifting devices, ramps, and portable bridge plates are pieces of equipment that help people with disabilities to safely board and deboard vehicles.

Lifting Device, Ramp, Portable Bridge Plate Requirements

Each lifting device, ramp, or portable bridge plate must have the following:

A Colour Strip

 The colour strip must run the full width of the bottom edge of the lifting device,

ramp, or portable bridge plate.

 The strip must be high colour-contrasted with its background. A high colour-

contrasted strip will assist people with disabilities in distinguishing where the

edge of the lifting device, ramp, or portable bridge plate meets the ground, or

the transition from a sloped surface to a flat surface.

A Slip-resistant Platform Surface

 A slip-resistant surface is one that even when wet provides friction between

the surface and a person’s footwear, mobility aid or mobility assistive device.

This reduces the risk of slipping.

Raised Edges

 The raised edges must be high enough to prevent or hinder a mobility aid

from rolling off the edge while boarding or deboarding the vehicles.





Exemption



Vehicles Regulated under Ontario Regulation 629

Vehicles regulated under Ontario Regulation 629 “Accessible Vehicles”, under the Highway Traffic Act, and that have lifting devices, ramps, or portable bridge plates, are not subject to this section.

This is intended to eliminate duplication of requirements between the two regulations, and to recognize the existing inspection and enforcement capabilities under the Highway Traffic Act.





Section 60



Steps

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

60(1) Every conventional transportation service provider shall ensure that where transportation vehicles are equipped with steps, the steps meet the following requirements:

1. The top outer edge of each step is marked by a colour strip that is high colour-contrasted with its background, to assist with visual recognition, that runs the full width of the leading edge of the step, excluding any side edge mouldings, and can be viewed from both directions of travel.

2. The steps have surfaces that are slip resistant and that produce minimal glare.

3. The steps have uniform, closed riser heights and tread depths, subject to the structural limitations of the vehicle.

(2) This section applies in respect of the following:

1. Transit buses.

2. Motor coaches.

3. Streetcars.

4. Subways.

5. Light rail.

6. Commuter rail.

7. Inter-city rail.

(3) Despite subsection (2), this section does not apply to vehicles regulated under Regulation 629 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1990 (Vehicles for the Transportation of Physically Disabled Passengers) made under the Highway Traffic Act. (4) Conventional transportation service providers shall comply with the requirements of this section in respect of its vehicles to which this section applies that are manufactured on or after January 1, 2013.



(5) Despite subsection (4), where a conventional transportation service provider enters into a contractual obligation to purchase new or used vehicles of the type referenced in subsection (2) on or after July 1, 2011, the transportation service provider shall ensure the vehicles meet the requirements of this section.



The Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is to make sure that the steps on all conventional transportation vehicles include consistent accessibility and safety features.

Table 39 - When do Organizations have to Comply

Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

Conventional transportation service providers Applies to vehicles

manufactured on or after

Applies to the following vehicles: January 1, 2013.

 transit buses

 motor coaches

 streetcars

 subways

 light rail

 commuter rail

 inter-city rail.





Implementing the Requirement



The general rule for the technical requirements is that they apply to vehicles manufactured on or after January 1, 2013.

However, the technical requirements also apply to vehicles manufactured before January 1, 2013. If a conventional transportation service provider enters into a contract to purchase a vehicle on or after July 1, 2011, then that vehicle must also meet the technical requirements of the regulation.

Conventional transportation service providers must make sure that all transportation vehicles that have steps meet the following requirements for them.

Edging

The top outer edge of each step must be marked by a colour strip. The colour of this strip must be high colour-contrasted with the colour of the background to help people with disabilities distinguish the edge of the step.

The colour strips must run the full width of the leading edge of the steps, excluding any side edge mouldings. Generally, side edge mouldings are small and raised above the level of the step itself, often for safety reasons, and cannot be effectively marked with a colour strip.

The colour strips must be visible from both directions of travel when passengers are walking up the steps to board the vehicles and walking down the steps to deboard.

On some vehicles, for example motor coaches, the centre aisle may slope slightly upward from the front entrance toward the back of the vehicle. This requires a step (of varying heights) to access some front row seats. These steps are not considered in the path of travel and are therefore not required to meet the colour strip requirement.

Surfaces

The steps must have slip-resistant surfaces and produce minimal glare.

A slip-resistant surface is one that, even when wet, provides enough friction between the surface and a person’s footwear, mobility aid, or mobility assistive device to reduce the risk of slipping. A minimal glare surface is one that, under normal circumstances, reduces the glare from the sun or from artificial lights. This makes it easier for passengers with disabilities to see the steps when boarding or deboarding the vehicles.



Heights and Depths



The steps must have the same closed riser heights and same tread depths, subject to the structural limitations of the vehicle.

Consistent height and depth of steps will assist people with disabilities when using the steps.

The risers of the steps must be closed. This refers to the back vertical portion of the steps. Open riser heights can be a tripping hazard for a foot or mobility assistive device.

Exemption

Vehicles Regulated under Ontario Regulation 629

Vehicles regulated under Ontario Regulation 629 “Accessible Vehicles”, under the Highway Traffic Act are not subject to this section.

This is intended to eliminate duplication of requirements between the two regulations, and to recognize the existing inspection and enforcement capabilities under the Highway Traffic Act.





Section 61



Indicators and Alarms

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

61(1) Every conventional transportation service provider shall ensure that where its transportation vehicles have a ramp, lifting device or a kneeling function, each of them is equipped with a visual warning lamp indicator mounted on the exterior near the mobility aid accessible door and with an audible warning alarm.

(2) The visual warning lamp indicator and the audible warning alarm must function when the kneeling function, ramp or lifting device is in motion.

(3) If a ramp or lifting device is being manually operated, no warning lamp indicator or warning alarm is required.

(4) This section applies in respect of the following:

1. Transit buses.

2. Motor coaches.

3. Streetcars.

4. Subways.

5. Light rail.

6. Commuter rail.

7. Inter-city rail.

(5) Despite subsection (4), this section does not apply to vehicles regulated under Regulation 629 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1990 (Vehicles for the Transportation of Physically Disabled Passengers) made under the Highway Traffic Act.

(6) Conventional transportation service providers shall comply with the requirements of this section in respect of its vehicles to which the section applies that are manufactured on or after January 1, 2013. (7) Despite subsection (6), where a conventional transportation service provider enters into a contractual obligation to purchase new or used vehicles of the type referenced in subsection (4) on or after July 1, 2011, the transportation service provider shall ensure the vehicles meet the requirements of this section.



(8) Subsection (7) does not apply if the installation of the warning lamp indicator or warning alarm would impair the structural integrity of the vehicle.



Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is to make sure appropriate visual and audible warning indicators and alarms are installed on conventional transportation vehicles to indicate movement of a ramp or lifting device or that the “kneeling” function is operating.

Table 40 - When do Organizations have to Comply



Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

Conventional transportation service providers Applies to vehicles manufactured

on or after January 1, 2013.

Applies to the following vehicles:

 transit buses

 motor coaches

 streetcars

 subways

 light rail

 commuter rail

 inter-city rail.



Implementing the Requirement



The general rule for the technical requirements is that they apply to vehicles manufactured on or after January 1, 2013.

However, the technical requirements may apply to vehicles manufactured before January 1, 2013. If a conventional transportation service provider enters into a contract to purchase a vehicle on or after July 1, 2011, then that vehicle must also meet the technical requirements of the regulation.

Warning Indicators and Alarms

Conventional transportation service providers must make sure that the vehicles with ramps or lifting devices or which “kneel” are equipped with warning lamps and alarms.

The lamps and alarms will provide visual and audible alerts when the ramps or lifting devices are being used or when the bus is kneeling down to let passengers on or off. The warning alarms and lamps indicate that movement is, or will be, happening outside of the vehicle and warn of a potential hazard.

This is intended to assist with the safety of both people with and without disabilities who may be outside the vehicle.

Warning Lamps

Warning lamp indicators are usually amber in colour and flash on and off to warn those in the vicinity that a ramp or lifting device is moving or that the vehicle is kneeling. However, there is no specific colour or flashing requirement.

The warning lamps required by this regulation serve a different function than other standard lights, such as hazard lights, that may be required on other vehicles.

The visual warning lamp indicator must be mounted on the exterior of the vehicle, near the mobility aid accessible door.

Warning Alarms

There is no specific tone or sound required for warning alarms. Using the Lights and Alarms



The visual warning lamp indicator and the audible warning alarm must function when the ramp or lifting device is moving or when the bus is kneeling down or rising.



The visual and audible alarms are only required when the ramp, lifting device and kneeling function are being used. The visual and audible alarms are not required during regular door opening and closing where these devices are not in use.

On some vehicles, such as subways, visual warning lamp indicators and audible warning alarms are used when the doors open and close. These continue to be permitted.

A warning lamp indicator or warning alarm is not required when a ramp or lifting device is being manually operated. This could be because it is not electronic, or because it is not working properly. In these cases, the person operating the ramp or device can tell people who are in the vicinity about the potential hazard.

Exemptions

Structural Integrity

Conventional transportation service providers who purchase a new or used vehicle (to which the general rule respecting the January 1, 2013 manufacture date does not apply) on or after July 1, 2011 do not have to meet the requirements pertaining to indicators and alarms if their installation would impair the structural integrity of the vehicle.

Vehicles Regulated under Ontario Regulation 629

Vehicles regulated under Ontario Regulation 629 “Accessible Vehicles”, under the Highway Traffic Act are not subject to this section.

This is intended to eliminate duplication of requirements between the two regulations, and to recognize the existing inspection and enforcement capabilities under the Highway Traffic Act.





Section 62

Section 63



Categories of Eligibility

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

63(1) Every specialized transportation service provider shall have three categories of eligibility to qualify for specialized transportation services,

(a) unconditional eligibility;

(b) temporary eligibility; and

(c) conditional eligibility.

(2) For purposes of eligibility for specialized transportation services, specialized transportation service providers shall categorize persons with disabilities as follows:

1. A person with a disability that prevents them from using conventional transportation services shall be categorized as having unconditional eligibility.

2. A person with a temporary disability that prevents them from using conventional transportation services shall be categorized as having temporary eligibility.

3. A person with a disability where environmental or physical barriers limit their ability to consistently use conventional transportation services shall be categorized as having conditional eligibility.

(3) A specialized transportation service provider may deny requests for specialized transportation services to persons who are categorized as having temporary eligibility or conditional eligibility if the conventional transportation service is accessible to the person and the person has the ability to use it.

(4) Specialized transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2017.





Intent of this Requirement



The intent of this requirement is that specialized transportation service providers will establish three categories for eligibility and use them consistently when people with disabilities apply to use the services.

When do Organizations have to Comply

This requirement applies to specialized transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2017.

Implementing the Requirement

Categories of Eligibility

Every specialized transportation service provider must develop and use three categories of eligibility: unconditional eligibility, temporary eligibility and conditional eligibility.

Unconditional Eligibility

People with disabilities that prevent them from using conventional transportation services shall be categorized as having unconditional eligibility.

Example: As a result of a developmental disability, Stephen cannot safely board, travel on, and deboard conventional transportation services. Other methods of accommodating him, such as travel training, have been unsuccessful.

Temporary Eligibility

People with disabilities that are temporary but prevent them from using conventional transportation services shall be categorized as having temporary eligibility.

Example: Mary was in a car accident and because of her injuries cannot access conventional transportation services for three weeks.

Conditional Eligibility

People with disabilities who are unable to consistently use conventional transportation services because of physical or environmental barriers, such as the winter weather, shall be categorized as having conditional eligibility. Example: During the spring, summer and autumn, Henry is able to get to the bus stop to wait for #406 transit bus, which takes him to work. In the winter, however, he cannot manoeuvre his wheelchair through the snow and ice to the bus stop.



When applying the criteria for the three categories of eligibility, specialized transportation service providers should not base their decisions solely on the type of disability. They should also consider the person’s ability to use the local conventional transportation services and in what circumstances the person is able to use those services.



Offering Consistency

The three categories of eligibility for specialized transportation will be consistent across the province.

Every provider of specialized transportation services will use these three categories; however, the providers will apply the criteria for the three categories based on the facts of each situation.

Denying Requests

Specialized transportation service providers may deny requests for specialized transportation to people who have been categorized as having temporary or conditional eligibility, if the local conventional transportation service is accessible, and the person can use it.

This provision recognizes that some people with disabilities are able to access and use conventional transportation services.

Example: Mary was categorized as having a “temporary disability” as a result of her short-term disability. She lived across the street from a bus stop and the buses serving that route were accessible. However, the stop where Mary had to get off the bus for her job was not accessible. Consequently, for her journey to and from work, Mary was provided with specialized transportation.

On the weekends, Mary shopped at the local mall. She used the subway system, which she was able to access from the street and was connected to the mall. In this case, Mary did not encounter any barriers to the conventional transportation service. Consequently, the specialised transportation service provider denied service to Mary for that purpose.



Section 64



Eligibility Application Process

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

64(1) If a person has completed an application for eligibility for specialized transportation services and the person’s eligibility has not been determined within 14 calendar days after the completed application is received by the specialized transportation service provider, the person shall be considered to have temporary eligibility for specialized transportation services until a decision on his or her eligibility is made.

(2) A specialized transportation service provider shall not charge a fee to persons with disabilities who apply or who are considered eligible for specialized transportation services.

(3) A specialized transportation service provider may require a reassessment of the eligibility of temporarily eligible registrants at reasonable intervals.

(4) A specialized transportation service provider shall, upon the request of the person requesting specialized transportation services, make available to the requester all of his or her specialized transportation services eligibility application and decision information in accessible formats.

(5) A specialized transportation service provider shall establish an independent appeal process to review decisions respecting eligibility.

(6) A specialized transportation service provider shall make a decision on an appeal with respect to eligibility within 30 calendar days after receiving the complete appeal application, but if a final decision is not made within the 30 days, the applicant shall be granted temporary eligibility until a final decision is made.

(7) Specialized transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2014.

(8) A specialized transportation service provider shall have policies respecting the collection, use and disclosure of personal information collected for purposes of determining eligibility under this section. (9) In this section, “personal information” means personal information within the meaning of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.



Intent of this Requirement



The intent of this requirement is that specialized transportation service providers will meet standard service requirements for people with disabilities during the application and appeals process for specialized transportation services.

When do Organizations have to Comply

This requirement applies to specialized transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2014.

Implementing the Requirement

Specialized transportation service providers may not charge an application or assessment fee to people with disabilities who apply to use specialized transportation services.

This is separate from the fares the providers charge for use of their specialized transportation services.

Application Waiting Period

Once specialized transportation service providers have received a completed application for eligibility, they have 14 calendar days to make a decision. If they have not made a decision on an application by the end of the 14 days, they must give the applicant temporary eligibility until a decision on the eligibility is made.

This is intended to help people with disabilities who need specialized transportation services in two ways:

 First, it tells applicants how long they will wait before they will hear about their

applications for specialized transportation services. The provision lets them

know that their applications will not be held up for weeks because of backlogs

or administrative issues.

 Second, the provision encourages specialized transportation service

providers to process the applications quickly and to reduce the waiting times

for people with disabilities who have applied for the services. Providing Accessible Formats



When requested, specialized transportation service providers will give the person who is requesting specialized transportation services all of the information relating to his or her eligibility application, including the decisions, in accessible formats.



For more information on accessible formats, please go to the Glossary, which gives a general description. For more detailed information, go to Information and

Communications Standard, Section 12, “Accessible Formats and Communication

Supports”.

Re-assessing Eligibility

Specialized transportation service providers may re-assess, at reasonable intervals, the eligibility of people with disabilities who have been given temporary eligibility.

This recognizes that people with disabilities who have been given temporary eligibility to use the specialized transportation services may no longer need it at some point.

Example: A person who breaks both legs in an accident may require specialized transportation services for several months. Once his legs have healed, however, he may begin to use conventional transportation services once again.

Appealing the Process

Specialized transportation service providers are required to establish an independent appeal process to review their decisions on eligibility.

It is at the discretion of the specialized transportation service provider how the individuals or boards responsible for reviewing appeals will be selected or appointed.

Deciding within 30 days

Specialized transportation service providers are required to make decisions on appeals with respect to eligibility within 30 calendar days after receiving the completed appeal applications.

If final decisions are not made within the 30 calendar days, the specialized transportation service providers will grant applicants temporary eligibility. The applicants have temporary eligibility until final decisions are made.



If appeal decisions are in favour of the people with disabilities, then they will receive specialized transportation services according to the providers’ standard practices and procedures.



Upholding the original decision

If appeal decisions uphold the original decisions of ineligibility for specialized transportation services, then the people with disabilities appealing the decision will not be eligible to receive specialized services.

If these people with disabilities were granted temporary eligibility because no decisions on their appeals were made within 30 calendar days, then they would no longer be eligible for specialized transportation services.

Collecting Personal Information

Specialized transportation service providers must have policies on the collection, use and disclosure of personal information gathered for purposes of determining eligibility for specialized transportation services.

“Personal information” refers to personal information within the meaning of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.





Section 65



Emergency or Compassionate Grounds

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

65(1) Specialized transportation service providers shall develop procedures respecting the provision of temporary specialized transportation services earlier than in the 14 calendar days referred to in subsection 64 (1),

(a) where the services are required because of an emergency or on compassionate grounds; and

(b) where there are no other accessible transportation services to meet the person’s needs.

(2) A person shall apply for the services described in subsection (1) in the manner determined by the specialized transportation service provider.

(3) Specialized transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2014.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of the requirement is that specialized transportation service providers will develop procedures to respond to people with disabilities who need specialized services — because of an emergency or on compassionate grounds — earlier than the standard application timeline of 14 calendar days.

When do Organizations have to Comply

This requirement applies to specialized transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2014.

Implementing the Requirement

Under normal circumstances, when people with disabilities apply for eligibility for specialized transportation services, the specialized transportation service providers have 14 calendar days after receiving the completed application forms to make their decisions. Under this requirement, the specialized transportation service providers must develop procedures for granting temporary eligibility earlier than the 14 calendar days when the applicant needs specialized transportation services because of an emergency or on compassionate grounds.



These procedures would come into effect when there are no other accessible transportation services available to meet the individual’s needs.



For more information on the eligibility application process, please go to

Transportation, Section 64, “Eligibility Application Process”.

Example: The husband of a woman with a disability is her primary caregiver and driver. When he has a heart attack, his wife is unable to visit him because she cannot drive herself, and there are no other accessible transportation services (such as an accessible taxicab) in the area that she can access in order to get to the hospital.

In this situation, it would be appropriate to allow her temporary use of the specialized transportation services earlier than the standard 14-day waiting period.

Note: The need for specialized transportation services because of an emergency or on compassionate grounds is separate from a medical emergency or the need for an ambulance to bring a person to a hospital for medical attention. People who require urgent medical attention should call 9-1-1 or contact their local emergency service.

Applying for Emergency or Compassion Grounds

People with disabilities who need specialized transportation services because of an emergency or on compassionate grounds must apply in a manner determined by the specialized transportation service provider. This could include, for example, an abbreviated application form.

Specialized transportation service providers have the discretion to determine what criteria are developed to provide the service for emergencies or on compassionate grounds.

The providers will also decide what parameters to put in place when temporary specialized transportation services are granted for emergencies or on compassionate grounds. These parameters could include the number of days that service may be provided.



Collecting Personal Information



Specialized transportation service providers should consider the confidentiality of personal information and develop policies respecting the collection, use and disclosure of personal information collected for purposes of determining eligibility for specialized transportation services based on emergency or compassionate grounds.





Section 66



Fare Parity

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

66(1) Where conventional transportation services and specialized transportation services are provided by separate transportation service providers in the same jurisdiction, the specialized transportation service provider shall not charge more than the highest fare charged for conventional transportation services in the same jurisdiction.

(2) Specialized transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of subsection (1) by January 1, 2017.

(3) Where a transportation service provider provides both conventional transportation services and specialized transportation services, the transportation service provider shall ensure that there is fare parity between conventional transportation services and specialized transportation services.

(4) Transportation service providers to which subsection (3) applies shall meet the requirements of that subsection by January 1, 2013.

(5) Where a transportation service provider provides both conventional transportation services and specialized transportation services, the transportation service provider shall ensure that the same fare structure is applied to conventional transportation services and specialized transportation services.

(6) Where a transportation service provider provides both conventional transportation services and specialized transportation services, the transportation service provider shall ensure that the same fare payment options are available for all transportation services, but alternative options shall be made available to persons with disabilities who cannot because of their disability use a fare payment option.

(7) Conventional transportation service providers and specialized transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of subsections (5) and (6) by January 1, 2013.

(8) In this section, “fare structure” means the fare price determined by fare media, such as cash, tickets, passes and bulk quantity discounts and by fare category, such as adults, seniors and students, but does not include promotional fares that a transportation service provider may employ from time to time.



Intent of this Requirement



The intent of this requirement is that specialized transportation service providers charge people with disabilities fares that are consistent with those charged on conventional transportation services.

The requirement also makes sure that people with disabilities who use specialized transportation services have the same fare structures and fare payment options as those offered on conventional transportation services.

Table 42 - When do Organizations have to Comply



Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

Implementing the Requirement



Providing Fare Parity

Same provider

Transportation service providers that operate both conventional transportation services and specialized transportation services must make sure that there is fare parity between the two services.

Different providers

Specialized transportation service providers that do not provide conventional transportation may not charge people with disabilities more than the highest fare charged by the conventional transportation services in the same area.

This is intended to make sure that the fares paid by people with disabilities to use specialized transportation are similar to what they would pay if they could travel on the conventional transportation services.

Structuring Fares

Providers that operate both conventional transportation services and specialized transportation services in the same area must make sure that the same fare structure is applied to both services.

Fare structure refers to the fare price, which is determined by fare media and fare category.

 Fare media can include cash, tickets, passes and bulk quantity discounts.  Fare category can include adults, seniors and students.

From time to time, some transportation service providers may offer promotional packages and fares. In these circumstances, these promotional packages and fares are not considered fare structures.

This provision recognizes unique circumstances, such as conventional transportation service providers offering free travel on a new conventional route for promotional reasons, or conventional transportation service providers offering reduced fares for people with disabilities who can use the conventional services. Paying Fares



Providers that operate both conventional transportation services and specialized transportation services in the same area must make sure that the same fare payment options are available for all passengers.



For example, if tokens are accepted on the conventional transportation service, then tokens must be accepted on the specialized transportation service.

However, alternative options must also be made available to people with disabilities, who because of their disabilities cannot use commonly used fare payment option.

For example, some people with disabilities may have difficulty depositing coins or tickets into fare boxes. Other people with disabilities may experience problems with the complexity or inaccessibility of the machines for paying fares. Transportation service providers must address these barriers by providing alternative fare payment options.





Section 67



Visitors

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

67(1) Every specialized transportation service provider shall,

(a) make specialized transportation services available to visitors; and

(b) consider as eligible,

(i) visitors who provide confirmation that they are eligible for specialized transportation services in the jurisdiction in which they reside, or

(ii) visitors who meet the specialized transportation services eligibility requirements of the specialized transportation service provider.

(2) Every specialized transportation service provider shall develop criteria to determine who falls into the category of visitor for the purposes of this section.

(3) Specialized transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2013.

(4) A specialized transportation service provider shall have policies respecting the collection, use and disclosure of personal information collected for purposes of determining eligibility under this section.

(5) In this section, “personal information” means personal information within the meaning of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that specialized transportation service providers make their services available to visitors with disabilities.

When do Organizations have to Comply

This requirement applies to specialized transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2013.



Implementing the Requirement



Eligibility for Service

Specialized transportation service providers must make their transportation services available to visitors with disabilities.

Specialized transportation service providers must allow visitors with disabilities to use the services if they meet one of two conditions:

 The visitors are able to confirm that they are eligible for specialized

transportation services in their home jurisdiction.

 The visitors meet the eligibility requirements for specialized transportation

services of the provider of specialized transportation service in the area they

are visiting.

Developing Criteria for Visitors

It is at the discretion of each specialized transportation service provider to develop a definition of the term visitor, and to develop criteria to determine who falls into the category.

In addition, it is at the discretion of each specialized transportation service provider to decide whether or not there are time limits for visitors to remain eligible to use the services.

Collecting Personal Information

Specialized transportation service providers must have policies on the collection, use and disclosure of personal information gathered for purposes of determining eligibility for specialized transportation services.

“Personal information” refers to personal information within the meaning of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.





Section 68



Origin to Destination Services

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

68(1) Every specialized transportation service provider shall provide origin to destination services within its service area that takes into account the abilities of its passengers and that accommodates their abilities.

(2) Origin to destination services may include services on any accessible conventional transportation services.

(3) For the purposes of this section, origin to destination services refers to the overall package of transportation services that allows a specialized transportation service provider to provide, in a flexible way, transportation services in a manner that best meets the needs of persons with disabilities.

(4) Specialized transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by July 1, 2011.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that specialized transportation service providers provide origin to destination transportation services to eligible people with disabilities.

Providers may deliver this service by using specialized transportation services only, or a combination of specialized and conventional transportation services.

When do Organizations have to Comply

The requirement applies to specialized transportation service providers. They must comply by July 1, 2011.

Implementing the Requirement

Every specialized transportation service provider must provide origin to destination services within its service area.





Origin to Destination



Origin to destination services refers to a package of transportation services that allows people with disabilities to travel from their points of origin to their destination points.

Origin to destination services must take into account the abilities of the people with disabilities. This requirement recognizes that some people with disabilities are able to use accessible conventional transportation services, but may also require specialized transportation services for portions of their trips.

In some cases, origin to destination services could include door-to-door or curb-to-curb service, if applicable and required by the person with a disability. In other cases, origin to destination services could include both specialized transportation services and accessible conventional transportation service routes – the specialized service acts as a “feeder” service to the accessible conventional services.

Example of “feeder” service

A person with a disability requires specialized transportation services for only a portion of his commute to work each day. The other portion of the commute is accessible on conventional transportation for him because the subway station at the end of the trip has an elevator.

Using what is available and accessible

This requirement recognizes that there are often various types of vehicles and services available in a jurisdiction, including accessible conventional transportation services.

This requirement gives specialized transportation service providers the flexibility to use accessible conventional transportation services for portions of trips, recognizing the abilities of the people with disabilities.

This allows specialized transportation service providers to deliver service to people with disabilities, while enabling those people with disabilities who are able to use accessible conventional transportation services to do so when and where this is possible.



Section 69



Coordinated Service

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

69(1) Where specialized transportation services are provided in adjacent municipalities within contiguous urban areas, the specialized transportation service providers shall facilitate connections between their respective services.

(2) Specialized transportation service providers to which subsection (1) applies shall determine the accessible stops and drop off locations in the contiguous urban areas that have specialized transportation services.

(3) Specialized transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2013.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that specialized transportation service providers will make it easier for people with disabilities to make connections between their services and the specialized transportation services that are provided in adjacent municipalities.

When do Organizations have to Comply

The requirement applies to specialized transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2013.

Implementing the Requirement

Specialized transportation service providers in adjacent municipalities in contiguous urban areas, such as the Greater Toronto Area, must facilitate connections between their services to help people with disabilities make connections.

Adjacent municipalities within a contiguous urban area are two municipalities whose borders are noticeable only by the signs announcing that individuals have left one municipality and entered another. The roads, houses, stores, and office buildings continue in an unbroken strip from one municipality to the next. By requiring specialized transportation service providers to coordinate their schedules, people with disabilities will be able to travel to adjacent municipalities to work, attend school, or visit friends or family in a more coordinated manner and without worrying about being stranded.



Coordinated Stops and Drop Off Locations



Specialized transportation service providers shall determine the accessible stops and drop off locations in the adjacent urban areas that have specialized transportation services.

This is intended to reduce confusion and support a seamless transition from one specialized transportation service provider to another.





Section 70



Hours of Service

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

70(1) Where conventional transportation services and specialized transportation services are provided by separate transportation service providers in the same jurisdiction, the specialized transportation service provider shall ensure that it has, at a minimum, the same hours and days of service as any one of the conventional transportation service providers.

(2) Where a transportation service provider provides both conventional transportation services and specialized transportation services, it shall ensure that the specialized transportation services have, at a minimum, the same hours and days of service as the conventional transportation services.

(3) Specialized transportation service providers to which subsection (1) applies shall meet the requirements of subsection (1) by January 1, 2017 and transportation service providers to which subsection (2) applies shall meet the requirements of subsection (2) by January 1, 2013.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that specialized transportation service providers provide, at a minimum, service during the same hours and on the same days as the conventional transportation services.

Table 43 - When do Organizations have to Comply

Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

Organizations that provide specialized By January 1, 2017. transportation services only (i.e. do not provide

conventional transportation services)



Organizations that provide both conventional and By January 1, 2013. specialized transportation services



Implementing the Requirement



Separate Transportation Service Providers

Specialized transportation service providers that do not provide conventional transportation services in the same area must offer, at a minimum, service for the same hours and on the same days as any one of the conventional transportation services in the area.

This requirement recognizes that people with disabilities have commitments and responsibilities that require travel and need to be able to travel at the same times as people who use conventional transportation services.

One Specialized Transportation Provider for Several Municipalities

In some parts of the province, there may be one specialized transportation service provider that provides service for several municipalities. Each of the municipalities, however, may have their own conventional transportation service provider. In such cases, the specialized transportation service must operate during the same hours and on the same days as any one of the conventional transportation service providers.

For example, “A” is a specialized transportation service provider that provides service in three separate municipalities, “X”, “Y”, and “Z”. Each of these municipalities has its own conventional transportation service provider.

Under this requirement, specialized transportation service provider “A” must provide the same hours and days of service as any one of conventional transportation service providers “X”, “Y”, or “Z”.





Table 44 - Specialized Transportation Provider Example





Conventional Transportation

Service Provider “X”

Same Transportation Service Provider

When a transportation service provider provides both conventional and specialized transportation services, it shall make sure that the specialized transportation service operates, at a minimum, for the same hours and on the same days as the conventional transportation service.





Section 71



Bookings

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

71(1) Every specialized transportation service provider shall, where the specialized transportation services require reservations,

(a) provide same day service to the extent that it is available; and

(b) where same day service is not available, accept booking requests up to three hours before the published end of the service period on the day before the intended day of travel.

(2) A specialized transportation service provider to whom subsection (1) applies shall provide accessible means to accept reservations.

(3) Specialized transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2014.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that specialized transportation service providers will provide same day service, to the extent that it is available, and accept bookings for service as close as possible to the date requested.

When do Organizations have to Comply

The requirement applies to specialized transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2014.

Implementing the Requirement

Same Day Service

Specialized transportation service providers that require eligible people with disabilities to make reservations are required to provide same day service to the extent that it is available.





Example: A person with a disability calls his local specialized transportation service provider at 11:30 a.m. to book transportation for a 3:00 p.m. appointment that day. The provider must provide specialized transportation, if available.



Next Day Services and Advance Bookings

When same day service is not available, specialized transportation service providers are required to accept booking requests up to three hours before the published end of their service period on the day before the intended day of travel.

Note: In this case, the term “service period” refers to the hours of the day during which transportation services are offered. The term does not refer to the general office hours — e.g., 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. — of the providers of specialized transportation services.

Example: Sarah plans to meet friends and go to the 1:30 p.m. matinee of a movie on Friday, June 3rd. Her local specialized transportation service provider offers daily service from 6 a.m. to midnight. The specialized transportation service provider must accept Sarah’s booking request by 9 p.m. (three hours before midnight) on Thursday June 2nd.

Accessible Booking

Specialized transportation service providers must provide an accessible means to accept reservations.

This will make sure that people with disabilities can make bookings for specialized transportation services. For example, specialized transportation service providers may offer the options of making a booking online and over the telephone.





Section 72



Trip Restrictions

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

72(1) No specialized transportation service provider shall limit the availability of specialized transportation services to persons with disabilities by,

(a) restricting the number of trips a person with a disability is able to request; or

(b) implementing any policy or operational practice that unreasonably limits the availability of specialized transportation services.

(2) Specialized transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2014.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is to prevent specialized transportation service providers from limiting the availability of their services to people with disabilities.

When do Organizations have to Comply

The requirement applies to specialized transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2014.

Implementing the Requirement

No Restrictions on Requests for Trips

Specialized transportation service providers may not limit the availability of specialized transportation services to people with disabilities by restricting the number of trips people with disabilities are able to request.

For instance, they may not restrict the number of trips people with disabilities may request using specialized transportation to ten trips a week.

Example: Lucy can request travel on her local specialized transportation service to go to and from work, Monday to Friday. On the weekends, she can request additional trips to go shopping, to visit friends and to attend concerts. No Unreasonable Policies or Practices



Specialized transportation service providers may not put a policy or operational practice in place that unreasonably limits the availability of specialized transportation services to people with disabilities.



For example, a specialized transportation service provider cannot develop a policy that states if a person misses two trips without cancelling in advance, then that person would no longer be eligible for specialized transportation services.

This provision removes unreasonable and unfair barriers that people with disabilities would not face if they were able to use conventional transportation services.

Reasonable Limits on Use of Services

Specialized transportation service providers may develop policies or operational practices that place reasonable limits on the use of their services. The intent of such policies would be to prevent the misuse of the services.

For example, a specialized transportation service provider could institute a policy to make sure that people with disabilities do not use the service to support their jobs as couriers.

Or, they may develop policies to address people with disabilities who consistently book the services and then, without cancelling, miss the trips.

Note: Consistently missed trips would not mean occasionally missing two trips in a row. Two missed trips would not be considered consistent or regular. A reasonable policy would be one that addresses consistent cancellations or no-shows.





Section 73



Service Delays

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

73(1) Every specialized transportation service provider, where the specialized transportation services require reservations, shall provide information on the duration of service delays to affected passengers by a method agreed to by the specialized transportation service provider and passenger.

(2) For the purposes of this section, a service delay is a delay of 30 minutes or more after the scheduled pick-up time.

(3) This section does not apply in respect of delays in service that arise during the trip.

(4) Specialized transportation service providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2013.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that specialized transportation service providers inform people with disabilities when there will be delays in the scheduled pick-up times.

Information about the delays will be communicated through methods that have been agreed on in advance by the providers and the people with disabilities.

When do Organizations have to Comply

The requirement applies to specialized transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2013.

Implementing the Requirement

Purpose of Notification

Specialized transportation service providers that require reservations must provide information on the length of the pick-up delays to the people with disabilities who have not yet been picked up. This is intended to assist people with disabilities since they will be informed that their pick-up will be delayed, which will reduce confusion or questions regarding why the vehicle has not yet arrived.



This is especially important during severe weather or when the scheduled pick-up locations are not safe places for people with disabilities to wait for a long time because of traffic or the time of day or night, etc.



Defining a Service Delay

A service delay is a delay of 30 minutes or more after the scheduled pick-up time.

A service delay does not refer to any delays that may be encountered once the person with a disability is on the vehicle operated by the specialized transportation service provider. These people who are already on the vehicle would be aware that there is a delay in service.

The intent is to assist people with disabilities who are waiting on the street, in a lobby, etc., not those already in the vehicle.

Examples

Unexpected delays

A car accident closed a downtown intersection. As a result, a specialized transportation vehicle was stuck in a traffic jam. As this delay was unexpected, and not known in advance of the trip, the specialized transportation service provider was not required to inform the people with disabilities who were waiting to be picked up that the service was running late.

Predictable delays

A snowstorm dropped a metre of snow overnight. Many of the roads were unploughed and some were closed. In this case, the specialized transportation service provider was required to provide information to the affected people with disabilities that there would be delays. That is because these delays could be predicted before the vehicles departed to pick up the passengers.

Communicating a Delay

Specialized transportation service providers must provide information about the pick-up delays using methods that the providers and the people with disabilities have agreed to in advance. These could include a mobile phone, email or TTY service.





Section 74



Companions and Children

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

74(1) Every specialized transportation service provider shall allow companions to travel with persons with disabilities if space is available and will not result in the denial of service to other persons with disabilities.

(2) Every specialized transportation service provider shall allow dependants to travel with a person with a disability who is the parent or guardian of the dependant if appropriate child restraint securement systems and equipment are, if required, available.

(3) Specialized transportation services providers shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2012.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that specialized transportation service providers allow companions and dependent children to travel with eligible people with disabilities, when possible.

When do Organizations have to Comply

The requirement applies to specialized transportation service providers. They must comply by January 1, 2012.

Implementing the Requirement

Travelling with Companions

Companions may include the spouses, partners or friends of the eligible people with disabilities. A support person is not considered a companion.

Specialized transportation service providers are required to allow companions to travel with people with disabilities when there is enough space available.

Companions may not accompany people with disabilities if it results in other eligible people with disabilities being denied service. When companions travel with people with disabilities on specialized transportation vehicles, they — the companions — pay the fares they would pay if they were travelling on the conventional transportation system.



Travelling with Dependent Children



Specialized transportation service providers are required to allow dependants to travel with people with disabilities who are the parents or guardians.

Note: If dependent children require child restraint systems while travelling, then they may only accompany the eligible people with disabilities when the needed restraint systems are available.





Section 75



School Transportation

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

75(1) This section applies to every school board that provides transportation services for its students.

(2) School boards to which this section applies shall,

(a) ensure that integrated accessible school transportation services are provided for their students; or

(b) ensure that appropriate alternative accessible transportation services are provided for students with disabilities, where in the opinion of the board integrated accessible school transportation services are not possible or not the best option for a student with a disability because of the nature of the disability or safety concerns.

(3)School boards to which this section applies shall, in consultation with parents or guardians of students with disabilities,

(a) identify students with disabilities before the commencement of each school year or during the school year, based on the needs of the student with a disability;

(b) develop individual school transportation plans for each student with a disability that,

(i) detail student assistance needs for each student with a disability, and

(ii) include plans for individual student boarding, securement and deboarding; and

(c) identify and communicate to the appropriate parties the roles and responsibilities of the transportation provider, the parents or guardians of the student with the disability, the operator of the vehicle used to transport the student, appropriate school staff and the student with the disability. (4) School boards to which this section applies shall meet,



(a) the requirements of subsection (2) by July 1, 2011; and



(b) the requirements of subsection (3) by January 1, 2014.

(5) In this section,

“school board” means a board as defined in subsection 1 (1) of the Education Act; (“conseil scolaire”)

“transportation provider” includes an entity or person that has entered into an agreement with a board for the transportation of students under subsection 190 (6) of the Education Act; (“fournisseur de services de transport”)

“transportation services” means transportation that a board provides under section 190 of the Education Act. (“services de transport”)

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that school boards provide accessible school transportation services or accessible alternative transportation to students with disabilities.





Table 45 - When do Organizations have to Comply





Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

All school boards that provide By July 1, 2011

transportation services to their students

appropriate alternative accessible

transportation services

By January 1, 2014

Consult with parents or the guardians

of students with disabilities

These requirements apply to school boards, meaning a district school board or a school authority (as defined under the Education Act), that provide transportation services to its students.

Under the Education Act:

A district school board means

 English language public district school board

 English language separate district school board

 French language public district school board

 French language separate district school board

A school authority means

 a board of a district school area

 a board of a rural separate school

 a board of a combined separate school zone

 a board of a secondary school district established under section 67 of the

Education Act

 a board established under section 68 of the Education Act  a board of a Protestant separate school.



Implementing the Requirement



Providing Accessible Transportation

School boards that provide transportation services to their students must provide integrated accessible school transportation services or appropriate alternative accessible transportation services for their students with disabilities.

Integrated transportation means that all students, including students with disabilities, travel on the same school transportation vehicles.

This is intended to recognize the value of integrating transportation for students.

Alternative Accessible Transportation

School boards are not required to provide integrated accessible transportation if, in the opinion of the board, integrated accessible transportation services are not possible or not the best option for a student with a disability because of the nature of the disability or safety concerns.

In these cases, the boards must provide appropriate alternative accessible transportation services for the students with disabilities, such as providing service on mobility aid accessible taxicabs.

Example: Alternative accessible transportation services may be appropriate if there is no lifting device on a school bus to board a student who uses a mobility aid, if a student with a disability cannot safely travel with the other students, or if a student with a disability requires door-to-door service at the beginning and end of the day.

The school board makes the final decision about whether or not to provide integrated school transportation for students with disabilities.

Providing Transportation Supports

Identification of Students with Disabilities

School boards must consult with the parents or guardians of students with disabilities to identify those students who have disabilities before the school year begins, or during the school year if the needs of the students change. This provision recognizes that much can change for students over the course of a school year, including the following:



 a student can develop a disability



 a student’s disability can change

 a student can move from one jurisdiction or school board to another.

Each school board is responsible for identifying its students with disabilities. The boards remain responsible for developing the processes used to determine whether or not students with disabilities are eligible for school transportation services.

Developing Individual School Transportation Plans

School boards are also required to develop individual transportation plans to support students with disabilities.

Note: The individual school transportation plan is a separate document from a student’s Individual Education Plan (IEP), which is also prepared by a board and required by the Ministry of Education.

A school board must consult with the parents or guardians of students with disabilities when developing individual school transportation plans.

Individual school transportation plans are required for students with disabilities who use school transportation services, whether that service is provided on a regular school bus or an alternative accessible transportation vehicle.

This includes students with disabilities who use the regular school buses and for whom no formal disability accommodations are required.

This provision is intended to be proactive and prevent barriers related to transportation from arising in the future. Although some students with disabilities may not require support or accommodation most of the time, their disabilities must be noted in their individual school transportation plans. This may consist of simply indicating the student has “x” disability and that there are no transportation-related accommodation needs at this time. The intent is to make sure that there is a record of students’ disabilities in case the circumstances pertaining to the disability change. An individual school transportation plan is not required for students with disabilities who do not use school transportation services.



Individual school transportation plans must explain in detail what assistance students with disabilities require, including plans for when they board the vehicles, for securement, and when deboarding the vehicles.



Example: Stephen uses a wheelchair and requires a mobility aid accessible vehicle. Paul does not need help climbing the steps when he boards the school bus but does need help going down them when he leaves it. Janey has low vision and needs someone to walk with her to her school bus.

Roles and Responsibilities

School boards must consult with the parents or guardians of students with disabilities to identify and communicate the roles and responsibilities of the following people and organizations:

 transportation provider — usually school bus companies that have contracts

with the board

 parents or guardians of the student with the disability  operators of the vehicles used to transport the student (i.e. the driver)  appropriate school staff

 students with a disability.

This will make sure that all persons and parties are aware of their roles and responsibilities as well as those of the others who are involved.

This also helps to create a seamless process and to promote a greater understanding and awareness of the needs of the students with disabilities.

Definitions

For the purposes of this requirement, the following definitions apply:

 Transportation provider – this includes an entity or person that has entered

into an agreement with a board for the transportation of students under

subsection 190 (6) of the Education Act

 Transportation services – this means transportation that a board provides

under section 190 of the Education Act.



Section 76



Public Sector Organizations

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

76(1) Designated public sector organizations described in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Schedule 1 that are not primarily in the business of transportation, but that provide transportation services, shall provide accessible vehicles or equivalent services upon request.

(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), transportation services do not include campus security services provided by a designated public sector organization described in paragraph 3 or 4 of Schedule 1.

(3) Designated public sector organizations referred to in subsection (1) shall meet the requirements of this section by July 1, 2011.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that hospitals, colleges and universities that provide transportation services will provide accessible transportation to people with disabilities.

If their general transportation services are not accessible, then they must provide an equivalent service.

Implementing the Requirement

Definitions

For the purposes of this requirement, the following definitions apply:

 The term “hospital” refers to a hospital as defined in section 1 of the Public

Hospitals Act.

 The term “college” refers to a college of applied arts and technology

established under the Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act

 The term “university” refers to a university in Ontario, including its affiliated

Government of Ontario

Accessible Transportation Services

Hospitals, colleges and universities can offer transportation services in either an integrated manner or through an equivalent service.

If requested, all hospitals, colleges and universities that provide transportation services are required to provide accessible transportation vehicles to people with disabilities who are eligible to use the services.

If a transportation vehicle is not accessible to people with disabilities, then the organization is not required to make modifications or to retrofit the vehicle. However, the organization is required to provide an equivalent service to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities.

Equivalent service means that the transportation service is of similar quality to that provided to others using the organization’s transportation services. The equivalent service would have the similar fares, schedules and routes. Note: Transportation services offered by college or university campus security does not have to meet the requirements of this regulation.



Examples



Accessible vehicle - A college shuttle bus transfers students from one campus to another or from the local train stop to the campus. This shuttle bus is equipped with two spaces for people with disabilities who use mobility aids, and the service is available at all campus stop locations.

Equivalent service - A hospital shuttle bus drives individuals between two affiliated city hospitals. This shuttle bus cannot be retrofitted to be accessible for people with disabilities. As a result, the hospital must provide an equivalent method of transportation on request, such as contracting with an accessible taxicab.

(3) Where a municipality has entered into arrangements with a person respecting the construction of bus stops and shelters in its jurisdiction, the municipality shall ensure that the person participates in the consultation and planning as described in subsections (1) and (2).

(4) Municipalities shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2013.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that all municipalities that provide conventional transportation services will consult on and plan for accessible bus stops and shelters in their communities.

When do Organizations have to Comply

All municipalities that offer conventional transportation services must meet these requirements by January 1, 2013.

Implementing the Requirement

Consultation

Any municipality that provides conventional transportation services must consult with the public and people with disabilities in the development of accessible design criteria to be considered in the construction, renovation or replacement of bus stops and shelters.



Municipalities with an Accessibility Advisory Committee established in



accordance with subsection 29 (1) or (2) of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act must also consult with the committee.

Planning for Accessible Bus Stops and Shelters

All municipalities that provide conventional transportation services must identify planning for accessible bus stops and bus shelters.

This planning must include the steps that will be taken to meet the goal of accessible bus stops and shelters.

All the planning, including the steps that will be taken, must be included in municipalities’ Accessibility Plans, as outlined in Section 4.

For more information, please go to the General Requirement, Section 4,

“Accessibility Plans”.

Note: The Integrated Accessibility Standard Regulation does not set a specific timeline for all bus stops or shelters to be made accessible.

Third Party Contracts

Some municipalities contract out the responsibility for bus stops and shelters to a third party, such as the local conventional transportation service provider or a private business.

In such cases, the municipality must make sure that the third party participates in the consultation and planning as described above.

In some municipalities, several organizations may have responsibility for different bus stops and shelters. In these situations, it is important that municipalities provide clear public communication about who is responsible for specific stops and shelters. This will make it possible for the general public including people with disabilities to contact the right organization with concerns, questions and comments.



Section 79



Duties of Municipalities – Accessible Taxicabs

Requirement as Stated in the Regulation

79(1) Every municipality shall consult with its municipal accessibility advisory committee, where one has been established in accordance with subsection 29 (1) or (2) of the Act, the public and persons with disabilities to determine the proportion of on-demand accessible taxicabs required in the community.

(2) Every municipality shall identify progress made toward meeting the need for on-demand accessible taxicabs, including any steps that will be taken to meet the need, in its accessibility plan required under Part I.

(3) Municipalities shall meet the requirements of this section by January 1, 2013.

(4) In this section, “accessible taxicab” means an accessible taxicab as defined in section 1 of Regulation 629 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1990 (Vehicles for the Transportation of Physically Disabled Persons) made under the Highway Traffic Act.

Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is that all municipalities will consult on and take steps to meet the need for on-demand accessible taxicabs in their communities.

When do Organizations have to Comply

All municipalities must meet the accessible taxicabs requirement by January 1, 2013.

Implementing the Requirement

Definitions

Accessible Taxicab - The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation uses

the same definition of “accessible taxicab” as Section 1, Regulation 629

“Accessible Vehicles”, under the Highway Traffic Act.





In general, an accessible taxicab is a vehicle which can safely and comfortably transport a passenger with a disability who needs to remain seated in his or her mobility aid for the duration of the trip.



On-Demand - The term “on-demand” refers to taxicabs that are available on request in the same way as people who do not need accessible taxicabs may request a taxicab, e.g. by telephoning for one or by hailing one on the street.

This is an important distinction, as many accessible taxicabs are subcontracted to specialized transportation service providers, or are otherwise booked in advance, and are not available to the general public on demand.

Consultation

All municipalities must consult with the public, including people with disabilities to determine the proportion of on-demand accessible taxicabs required in the community. The proportion of on-demand accessible taxicabs means the number of on-demand accessible taxicabs compared to the number of regular taxicabs.

Municipalities with an Accessibility Advisory Committee, established in

accordance with subsection 29 (1) or (2) of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, must also consult with the committee.

Progress and Steps

All municipalities must identify what progress they have made in meeting the need for on-demand accessible taxicabs, including any steps that will be taken to meet the need. This information must be included in municipalities’ Accessibility Plans.

For more information about accessibility plans, please go to General

Requirements, Section 4, “Accessibility Plans”.

Note: The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation does not state that a certain proportion of the taxicabs licensed by a municipality must be accessible, nor does the regulation set a timeline.





Section 80



Duties of Municipalities – Taxicabs

Requirement as Stated in Regulation

80(1) Any municipality that licenses taxicabs shall ensure that owners and operators of taxicabs are prohibited,

(a) from charging a higher fare or an additional fee for persons with disabilities than for persons without disabilities for the same trip; and

(b) from charging a fee for the storage of mobility aids or mobility assistive devices.

(2) Any municipality that licenses taxicabs shall ensure that owners and operators of taxicabs place vehicle registration and identification information on the rear bumper of the taxicab.

(3) Any municipality that licenses taxicabs shall ensure that owners and operators of taxicabs make available vehicle registration and identification information in an accessible format to persons with disabilities who are passengers.

(4) The information in subsection (2) shall meet the requirements of subsection 58 (3).

(5) Municipalities described in this section shall meet the requirements in this section,

(a) by July 1, 2011, in respect of subsection (1); and

(b) by January 1, 2012, in respect of subsections (2) and (3).

The Intent of this Requirement

The intent of this requirement is to prevent owners and operators of taxicabs from charging people with disabilities more than they would other passengers.

In addition, taxicabs will display their vehicle registration and identification information and make it available in accessible formats when requested. Table 47 - When do Organizations have to Comply





Affected Organizations Compliance Dates



Municipalities that licence taxicabs Requirements regarding fares and

fees by July 1, 2011

Requirements regarding taxicab

information by January 1, 2012



Implementing the Requirement

Fees and Fares

Municipalities that licence taxicabs must make sure that owners and operators of taxicabs do not charge a higher fare or an additional fee to people with disabilities than they would normally charge people without disabilities for the same trip.

Further, municipalities that licence taxicabs must make sure that owners and operators of taxicabs do not charge a fee for the storage of mobility aids or mobility assistive devices.

Example: An operator of a taxicab cannot charge a person with a disability a fee for collapsing a mobility aid, such as a manual wheelchair, and placing it into the trunk.

Taxicab Information

Information on Bumpers

Municipalities that licence taxicabs must make sure that owners and operators of taxicabs display vehicle registration and identification information on the rear bumper of their taxicabs.

For consistency, and to allow for easier recognition for people with disabilities, the information must meet the requirements for signage, outlined in section 58 (3) of this regulation.



For more information on signage, please go to Transportation, Section 58,



“Signage”.

Having registration and identification information on the rear bumpers will help people with disabilities to identify taxicab operators that have not treated them properly or fairly. For example, if an operator refused to pick-up a person with a disability who used a mobility aid because of the extra time required to provide service, then using the identification information, the person would be able to report the incident to the responsible municipal licensing body.

Information for Passengers

Municipalities that license taxicabs must make sure that owners and operators of taxicabs make vehicle registration and identification information available in an accessible format to people with disabilities who are passengers.

How this accessible vehicle registration and identification information is provided to passengers is at the discretion of the municipality.

Example: A municipality could require the information to be translated into Braille and placed on the plastic sleeve located on the back of the seat that holds the taxicab information. Or, the municipality may require operators to have business cards with their taxicab information printed in large print or Braille.

Providing vehicle registration and identification information in an accessible format is not only for "complaint" purposes. It will help people with disabilities who wish to re-book with considerate or pleasant operators. It will also help those who need to complete a “taxi-chit” and therefore require the taxicab information.

Part 4.1 - Design of Public Spaces Standard



(Accessibility Standards for the Built



Environment)





Overview





Accessible public spaces include specific features that make it easier for everyone – people with disabilities, seniors and families – to use public spaces. Some of these features are:



 Sidewalks that are free of barriers and wide enough to move around  Pedestrian signals at intersections with both audible and visual cues to move



people safely across the street



 Gentler ramp slopes



 Wider accessible parking spaces for people with mobility limitations  Service counters that a person seated in a mobility device can use.





Accessible public spaces also include recreational elements like trails, outdoor eating areas and play spaces that people of all abilities can enjoy. Accessibility requirements for the design of public spaces address elements that are located outdoors as well as some that are located inside of buildings.



Accessibility benefits everyone. Good public spaces are planned and designed from the beginning with accessibility in mind. Accessibility by design can provide people with disabilities with more opportunities to work, shop, travel and play independently.





Ontario Human Rights Code



The Ontario Human Rights Code requires organizations to accommodate people with disabilities to the point of undue hardship as defined in the Ontario Human



Rights Code (see section 1 of the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation for more details). The Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation does not replace or affect legal rights or obligations that arise under the Ontario Human Rights Code and other laws relating to the accommodation of people with disabilities. This means that the Ontario Human Rights Code or other applicable legislation may require additional accommodation measures that go beyond, or are different from, the standards established by the regulations of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA).





Final Proposed Accessible Built Environment Standard vs. Design of Public Spaces Standard





Under the AODA, a committee made up of people with disabilities, government representatives and representatives from affected sectors, such as municipalities and business, must develop accessibility standards.



The committee submitted its recommendations (the Final Proposed Accessible Built Environment Standards) to the Minister of Community and Social Services in July of 2010 for government consideration. The Minister has the authority to recommend that standards be adopted by regulation in whole, in part, or with modifications.



The Design of Public Spaces Standard, as part of the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation, is the government’s response to the committee’s recommendations on accessible public spaces. It is now law in Ontario as of January 1, 2013.



Organizations should note that accessibility requirements within the context of the Built Environment Standard as recommended by the external committee are found in both the AODA and Ontario’s Building Code.





Ontario’s Building Code





Barrier-free design requirements within buildings have been regulated through Ontario’s Building Code since 1975. Ontario’s Building Code regulates accessibility features inside buildings, such as accessible washrooms, as well as walkways or ramps that connect to building entranceways. The Design of Public Spaces Standard primarily regulates outdoor spaces, such as pedestrian crossings and trails, but also regulates indoor elements not included in the Building Code, such as service counters and fixed queuing guides.





The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing has worked alongside the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Employment to develop updated requirements for accessibility in both public spaces and in buildings. Updated Building Code requirements for accessibility in buildings come into effect on January 1, 2015.





Scope of Design of Public Spaces Standard Requirements





For the purposes of this standard only, “public spaces” are the elements that are regulated by this standard.



The requirements under the Design of Public Spaces Standard apply to new construction and the redevelopment of elements in public spaces. Unplanned changes to existing public spaces to meet the standard (retrofits) are not required. Unplanned changes can include emergency repairs or forced changes that were not anticipated or planned for in advance.



By applying the standard to new construction and redevelopment of elements, organizations can incorporate these changes into their regular planning practices.



Redevelopment of elements means any significant planned changes to a public space. Examples include moving a queuing area to a new location within a building, replacing the tables in an outdoor public use eating area, or replacing all equipment in a play space and resurfacing the ground below the equipment.



Redevelopment of elements does not include maintenance (both redevelopment and maintenance are defined separately in the regulation – see 80.1). Maintenance includes activities that:



 Keep public spaces in good working order, or



 Restore them to their original condition (such as painting or minor repairs)



For example, if an indicator light on an inaccessible pedestrian signal device is not working, replacing the light would be considered a maintenance activity, as it restores the device to good working order. Another example would be if an organization needed to repaint parking space lines in their lot after the winter due to weathering. This would be considered maintenance, because the repainting is intended to restore the lot to its original condition.





Redevelopment of elements does not include environmental mitigation or environmental restoration (both of which are defined in the regulation – see 80.1), which are generally activities intended to benefit the environment or prevent or protect the environment from the negative impact of human activities. In cases that constitute environmental mitigation or environmental restoration, compliance with these accessibility requirements is not required.





For example, construction activities for scientific research in environmentally sensitive areas like wetlands may not be subject to the requirements in this regulation. Similarly, if an activity is undertaken to mitigate the environmental impacts of local human activities as part of an environmental impact assessment, the requirements in this regulation may not apply.



The concept of redevelopment in this standard differs from the concept of “renovation” found in Ontario’s Building Code. The term “renovation” has specific criteria under the Building Code that must be met in order to be considered a renovation. In contrast, organizations are expected to determine what constitutes a “redevelopment”, within the meaning of the regulation, based on their specific situation.



These requirements establish minimum standards for all organizations; however, the requirements are flexible so organizations can respond to specific local needs and conditions.



There are seven areas covered by this standard:



 80.6 to 80.15: Recreational trails and beach access routes  80.16 to 80.17: Outdoor public use eating areas



 80.18 to 80.20: Outdoor play spaces



 80.21 to 80.31: Exterior paths of travel



 80.32 to 80.39: Accessible parking



 80.40 to 80.43: Obtaining services



 80.44: Maintenance





The majority of requirements in this standard affect elements found in outdoor public spaces. Some requirements in this standard apply to elements found indoors that are not covered by Ontario’s Building Code (service counters, fixed queuing guides and waiting areas) as well as outdoors. Relationship to Other Requirements in the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation





The General Requirements section of the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation also includes requirements that relate to the Design of Public Spaces Standard.



For example:



 Under section 4, all organizations, except small private and not-for-profit



organizations, must make sure their multi-year accessibility plans outline how



they will meet the requirements of the Integrated Accessibility Standards



Regulation, including the Design of Public Spaces Standard.



 Under section 5, designated public sector organizations are required to



“incorporate accessible design criteria and features when procuring or



acquiring goods, services or facilities.” This may be relevant to accessibility



features in public spaces, such as outdoor play space equipment or



accessible tables in outdoor eating areas.



Incorporating the Design of Public Spaces Standard requirements into the multi-year accessibility plans and accessible procurement practices required by the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation will help organizations plan and budget for the implementation of the standard before they come into effect.





Design of Public Spaces Standard Requirements





The guidelines for the Design of Public Spaces Standard have 44 sections, which can be broken down as follows:





Section 80.1 Definitions





Section 80.2 Application



This section sets out the application of the standard’s requirements. Section 80.3 Transition





This section sets out an organization’s obligations when contractual obligations relating to the requirements in this standard already exist.





Section 80.4 Slope ratios



This section sets out how slope ratios are calculated.





Section 80.5 Schedule



This section indicates when the Design of Public Spaces Standard applies, as determined by an organization’s size and type.





Sections 80.6 – 80.15 Recreational trails and beach access routes



These sections contain general and technical requirements for new and redeveloped recreational trails and beach access routes, including consultation, minimum clear width, clear height, signage and entrances. These sections also outline exceptions in specific situations.





Sections 80.16 – 80.17 Outdoor public-use eating areas



These sections contain general requirements for new and redeveloped outdoor eating areas, such as the percentage of accessible tables, ground surfaces and clear space required around eating areas.





Sections 80.18 – 80.20 Outdoor play spaces



These sections contain general requirements for new and redeveloped outdoor play spaces, such as consulting on local needs and accessible design.





Sections 80.21 – 80.31 Exterior paths of travel



These sections contain general and technical requirements for new and redeveloped exterior paths of travel and related features, such as ramps, stairs, curb ramps, accessible pedestrian signals at intersections and rest areas. These sections also outline exceptions in specific situations. Sections 80.32 – 80.39 Accessible parking





These sections contain general and technical requirements for new and redeveloped off-street accessible parking, such as types and numbers of spaces, access aisles and signage. The section on new and redeveloped on-street parking also outlines the requirement to consult on local need, design and placement of accessible parking spaces. These sections also explain specific exceptions and exemptions.





Sections 80.40 – 80.43 Obtaining services



These sections include general requirements for new service counters, new fixed queuing guides and new or redeveloped waiting areas.





Section 80.44 Maintenance



This section sets out the requirements that must be included in multi-year accessibility plans to demonstrate how organizations will maintain accessible elements in public spaces required by the standard.





Definitions, application and schedule





Section 80.1 Definitions





The terms defined below are intended to help organizations understand and implement the requirements of the Design of Public Spaces Standard.



“amenities” are objects placed in public spaces that provide a convenience or service. Examples include (but are not limited to) drinking fountains, benches and garbage containers. Organizations have the flexibility to determine what is an amenity based on their own best practices and standards.



“beach access routes” are routes intended to help people get to a beach area, but do not include the beach area itself. They are often constructed pathways that provide access from a parking lot, a recreational trail, a sidewalk or walkway, or an amenity. “bevel” means a small slope cut into a right angle that helps mobility devices to cross a small elevation change.





“cross slope” means the slope of a surface that is at a right angle to the direction of travel.



“environmental mitigation” means activities that are intended to address any negative effects on the environment caused by this standard, such as constructing a recreational trail, walkway, play space or parking lot.



“environmental restoration” means activities that will benefit the environment.



“in-line ramp” means a ramp that does not change direction.



“maintenance” means activities that are intended to keep existing public spaces in good working order. Maintenance can also restore the space or element back to its original condition. Maintenance work could include painting and minor repairs.



“off-street parking facilities” are designated areas where vehicles can be parked on a temporary basis, whether or not there is a charge for parking. This includes open area parking lots and structures, such as visitor parking spaces in lots, or multi-storey parking garages at shopping centres.



“on-street parking” means designated spaces where vehicles can be parked on a temporary basis, located on a public highway, street, avenue, parkway or similar type of road. On-street parking spaces often provide direct access to shops, offices and other facilities.



“recreational trails” means public trails intended to allow pedestrians to participate in recreation and leisure activities, such as walking through parks, using playgrounds, or enjoying nature.



“redeveloped” means a planned significant alteration to a public space. It does not include maintenance activities, environmental mitigation or environmental restoration.



“rest area” is a dedicated space on a recreational trail or exterior path of travel intended for public use that allows a person to stop and rest.



“running slope” means the slope of a surface that is parallel to the direction of travel.



“species at risk” means species identified on the Species at Risk in Ontario List under the Endangered Species Act, 2007 to protect areas where construction may damage the environment. “vibro-tactile walk indicators” are push-button signal devices at pedestrian crossings. They vibrate and communicate the walk cycle through the sense of touch.





Section 80.2 Application





The Design of Public Spaces Standard applies to all public, private and not-for-profit organizations that have one or more employees in Ontario, as outlined in



the Integrated Accessibility Standard Regulation (see section 2 for more details). Small private/not-for-profit organizations with 1-49 employees are exempt from certain requirements (identified throughout the document).



The organization that constructs or redevelops the public space must comply with the requirements. This does not mean that a person or organization hired to physically construct the space is responsible for compliance. If a school decides to build a play space, for example, then the school is responsible for ensuring that the play space meets Design of Public Spaces Standard requirements. Planners, architects, contractors or engineers who are hired to construct the space, would not be responsible for ensuring the work being completed adheres to the standard.



In lease agreement situations, a leaseholder that constructs or redevelops the public space would be required to comply, but not necessarily the landowner solely by virtue of his or her interest in the land.



For example, an organization may lease an unused parcel of land from another organization, and then build and maintain a recreational trail on it. In this case, the leaseholder building the trail is responsible for compliance with recreational trail requirements, not the landowner. Organizations may want to consider including adherence to the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 and its standards in their lease agreements and other contracts to ensure that all requirements are met.





Section 80.3 Transition





An organization does not need to meet the requirements of the Design of Public Spaces Standard if:





 it entered into a contract on or before December 31, 2012 to construct or



redevelop any of the elements outlined in the standard, and



 fulfilling the terms of the contract would result in contravening the standard.





The standard applies to projects that will result in public spaces being built on or after the relevant dates of compliance listed in the schedule (see Section 80.5 below). The transition clause only makes an exception for contracts signed on or before December 31, 2012.



For example, if a small business such as a private daycare signed a contract in 2011 to build an outdoor play space that will be completed in 2016, the play space may not need to comply with the standard. If the same organization signs a contract in 2013 to build a play space that will be completed in 2018, the play space must comply with the standard, because the transition clause would not apply.



Procurement requirements under Section 5 of the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation require the Government of Ontario and all designated public sector organizations to incorporate accessibility design criteria and features (e.g. physical design, product specifications, software etc.) into their procurement practices. This is so that goods, services and facilities that are purchased are more accessible to people with disabilities, unless it is not practicable to do so.



For example, if a municipality is constructing a new play space in 2014, they would not be required to meet the consultation requirements outlined in the standard until 2016. However, they may be required to purchase accessible equipment for the play space in order to meet the procurement requirements listed above.



As a best practice, when meeting obligations under Section 5 of the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation, organizations may choose to incorporate the upcoming requirements under the Design of Public Spaces Standard before they are required to do so.





Section 80.4 Slope ratios





Figure 1 - Running slope comparison





Organizations must meet slope ratio requirements when constructing or redeveloping certain elements outlined in this regulation. The regulation provides slope ratios for the following elements:



 Beach access routes (Section 80.10)



 Boardwalks (Section 80.12)



 Ramps on recreational trails or beach access routes (Section 80.13)  Exterior paths of travel, including sidewalks (Section 80.23)  Ramps on exterior paths of travel (Section 80.24)  Curb ramps (Section 80.26)



 Depressed curbs (Section 80.27).



A slope ratio describes the steepness of a slope. Slope ratios are important because they can help people with mobility limitations assess the degree of challenge they may experience when negotiating a change in level, such as on a ramp. Slope ratios also help organizations provide for adequate drainage on exterior spaces to keep them in good working order.



To interpret the slope ratios in this regulation, the first number in the ratio represents a unit of height elevation (rise), while the second number represents a unit of length (run). This means that for every one unit of elevation expressed as the first number in the ratio, the user has the length expressed in the second number to negotiate the one unit of elevation. The higher the second number is, the gentler the slope will be.



For example, if a ramp slope is 1:15, for every one metre of elevation (rise), the ramp provides 15 metres of length (run) for a person with a mobility device to negotiate that level change. The same ratio can be applied to other units of measure, such as inches, centimetres, feet and so on. If a ramp slope is 1:12, for every one unit of elevation, 12 units of length are provided to negotiate the level change. This means that a slope ratio of 1:15 provides a gentler slope than a slope ratio of 1:12.





Organizations should consult the section of the regulation that applies to the element they are building or redeveloping in order to determine the required slope ratios.



Section 80.5 Schedule





Organizations will be required to meet all the requirements for the standard



based on the class of their organization, as outlined in the definitions section of the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation. The requirements only apply to new construction or redevelopment of existing public spaces on and after the dates set out below. This gives organizations time to include accessibility in the earliest stages of planning and design.



Compliance is required based on the following schedule:  Government of Ontario and the Legislative Assembly: January 1, 2015  Designated public sector organizations: January 1, 2016  Large private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ employees: January 1,



2017

Recreational Trails and Beach Access Routes





Overview





Accessible recreational trails and beach access routes provide an inclusive experience that allows people of all abilities to enjoy natural spaces in our communities.



A recreational trail is a public pedestrian trail intended for recreational and leisure purposes. The standard applies to newly constructed or redeveloped recreational trails that an organization intends to maintain. The standard does not apply to the certain types of recreational trails, such as wilderness trails, backcountry trails and portage routes. These types of trails are difficult to access because of their location, and are built in a way that reduces their impact on the natural environment.



Multi-use trails are used for different purposes at different times. For example, pedestrians may use a trail in the summer, but in the winter, the trail becomes a snowmobile trail. Another example is a pedestrian trail that is also a biking trail. These types of trails are not “solely intended” for either snowmobiling or biking, and are required to comply with the Standard.



Beach access routes are routes constructed for public pedestrian use that provide access to public beaches from off-street parking facilities, recreational trails, exterior paths of travel and amenities. The standard applies to beach access routes that can be either permanent or temporary, but does not apply to beach access routes that are created through repetitive use and without formal authorization.



Organizations must meet the requirements of the standard when they construct a recreational trail or beach access route that they intend to maintain or redevelop an existing one.



Trails not constructed or redeveloped by an obligated organization but rather created in an unplanned way are not required to meet these requirements. For example, decommissioned railway lines that now serve as trails, but were never constructed or redeveloped by an obligated organization with formal authorization to serve as a trail are exempt. If an organization replaces a decommissioned railway line or other unplanned trail, such as a path created in a wooded area by frequent travel, with a new pedestrian trail, that new trail must meet the requirements.





Requirements for recreational trails and beach access routes apply on a go-forward basis to new construction and redeveloped trails and beach access routes. Organizations are not required to retrofit or change existing trails or beach access routes unless they choose to redevelop them.



This section is divided into the following five areas:



 80.6 – 80.8 Recreational trails and beach access routes, general  80.9 Technical requirements for recreational trails  80.10 Technical requirements for beach access routes  80.11 – 80.13 Technical requirements common to recreational trails and



beach access routes



 80.14 – 80.15 Exceptions to the requirements for recreational trails and beach



access routes





Recreational Trails and Beach Access Routes, General



Requirements as Stated in the Regulation



Trails



80.6 This Part applies to newly constructed and redeveloped recreational trails that an obligated organization intends to maintain, but does not apply to the following types of recreational trails:



1. Trails solely intended for cross-country skiing, mountain biking or the use of



motorized snow vehicles or off-road vehicles.



2. Wilderness trails, backcountry trails and portage routes.





Beach access routes



80.7 This Part applies to newly constructed and redeveloped beach access routes that an obligated organization intends to maintain, including permanent and temporary routes, and temporary routes that are established through the use of manufactured goods, which can be removed for the winter months.



Consultation, recreational trails



80.8 (1) Obligated organizations shall consult on the following before they 4. The slope of the trail.





5. The need for, and location of, ramps on the trail. 3. The need for, location and design of,



i. rest areas,



ii. passing areas,



iii. viewing areas,



iv. amenities on the trail, and



v. any other pertinent feature.





(2) Obligated organizations shall consult on the matters referred to in subsection (1) in the following manner:



1. Obligated organizations must consult with the public and persons with



disabilities.



2. Municipalities must also consult with their municipal accessibility advisory



committees, where one has been established in accordance with subsection



29 (1) or (2) of the Act.





Intent of these Requirements



These sections clarify the types of recreational trails and beach access routes that must comply with the regulation and those that do not. These requirements also outline the features of recreational trails that are subject to consultation as required before an obligated organization constructs new, or redevelops existing, recreational trails.

Implementing the Requirements





Consultations for recreational trails



Before constructing a recreational trail or redeveloping an existing trail, obligated organizations must consult with the public, including people with disabilities.



Municipalities with an Accessibility Advisory Committee, established in



accordance with subsection 29 (1) or (2) of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, must also consult with the committee.



Consultations must address the following design elements that may be part of the trail:



 The slope of the trail (e.g. the appropriate cross slope, running slope or



both)



 Need for, and location of, ramps on the trail



 Need for, location and design of:



o rest areas



o passing areas



o viewing areas



o amenities on the trail



o any other accessibility feature.



It is important to note that consultation on beach access routes is not required.



The intent of consultation on these specific elements is to give people with disabilities the opportunity to provide input as part of the planning and development of accessible trails. Consultation is important because it prevents organizations from assuming what accessibility features the people accessing the trail will need.



There is a common misconception that an accessible trail that is useable by people with disabilities must be flat. However, not every person with a disability wants to use a flat trail, as they may appreciate a challenging experience. Some people with disabilities will be able to use a trail regardless of the design specifications, even if it has a steep running slope. Understanding this can help designers and decision-makers when developing design solutions that meet the needs of the local population.





Consultations should be held as early as possible in the planning and design process to add value. That way, organizations can weigh all considerations before making decisions and finalizing design plans.



The consultation requirement does not set out a particular process or way to consult. The requirements recognize that consultations can be conducted in a wide variety of ways, depending on the organization.



This requirement also allows organizations to use consultation processes they may already have in place, or to combine consultations (e.g., consultations on play spaces and recreational trails may be conducted at the same time, based on an organization’s need to do both). For more information about accessible consultation processes, organizations may wish to consult the Ontario Municipal



Social Services Association’s Guides for Accessible Community Engagement . These guides were developed through the Accessibility Directorate of Ontario’s EnAbling Change Program.





Technical Requirements for Recreational Trails



Requirements as Stated in the Regulation





80.9 (1) Obligated organizations shall ensure that any recreational trails that they construct or redevelop, and that they intend to maintain, meet the following technical requirements:





1. A recreational trail must have a minimum clear width of 1,000 mm.



2. A recreational trail must have a clear height that provides a minimum head



room clearance of 2,100 mm above the trail.



3. The surface of a recreational trail must be firm and stable.



4. Where a recreational trail has openings in its surface,



i. the openings must not allow passage of an object that has a diameter of





ii. any elongated openings must be orientated approximately perpendicular



to the direction of travel.



5. Where a recreational trail is constructed adjacent to water or a drop-off, the



trail must have edge protection that meets the following requirements:



i. The edge protection must constitute an elevated barrier that runs along



the edge of the recreational trail in order to prevent users of the trail from slipping over the edge.



ii. The top of the edge protection must be at least 50 mm above the trail



surface.



iii. The edge protection must be designed so as not to impede the drainage



of the trail surface.



6. Despite paragraph 5, where there is a protective barrier that runs along the



edge of a recreational trail that is adjacent to water or a drop-off, edge



protection does not have to be provided.



7. The entrance to a recreational trail must provide a clear opening of between



850 mm and 1,000 mm, whether the entrance includes a gate, bollard or



other entrance design.



8. A recreational trail must have at each trail head signage that provides the



following information:



i. The length of the trail.



ii. The type of surface of which the trail is constructed.



iii. The average and the minimum trail width.



iv. The average and maximum running slope and cross slope.



v. The location of amenities, where provided.



(2) The signage referred to in paragraph 8 of subsection (1) must have text that,



(a) has high tonal contrast with its background in order to assist with



visual recognition; and



(b) includes characters that use a sans serif font.



(3) Where other media, such as park websites or brochures, are used by the obligated organization to provide information about the recreational trail, beyond advertising, notice or promotion, the media must provide the same information as listed in paragraph 8 of subsection (1).





Intent of these Requirements



These requirements provide organizations with minimum accessibility requirements that must be met when constructing new or redeveloping existing recreational trails that the organization intends to maintain.



Table 50 - When do Organizations Have to Comply



Affected Organizations Compliance Dates



Ontario Government and Legislative Assembly January 1, 2015



Designated public sector organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2016



Designated public sector organizations with 1-49 employees January 1, 2016



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2017



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 1-49 employees January 1, 2018





Implementing the Requirements





Minimum clear width



The minimum width of the surface of a new or redeveloped trail must be 1,000 mm. This is wide enough to accommodate a person using a mobility device, a cane or a service animal.





Minimum head room clearance



Head room clearance refers to the area above the surface of the trail. This area must be clear of any obstacle that a person may have to duck under, such as tree branches or signs. Obstacles in the overhead area above the trail are safety hazards for people with low or no vision. The minimum head room clearance on a trail is 2,100 mm above the trail surface. Obstacles must not be located lower than this height.





Trail surface



A firm and stable surface resists indentations. For example, when a person walks or wheels across it, the surface should return to its original condition once this pressure is removed. The trail surface must be firm and stable so that the wheels of a mobility device or the tips of canes, crutches or walkers will not sink into the surface.



Organizations can choose from a variety of materials that will achieve a firm and stable surface. Organizations have the flexibility to choose the most appropriate surface material, while still considering maintenance requirements or budget. The requirement for a firm and stable surface does not mean that organizations must use concrete or asphalt. When determining if a surface is firm and stable, organizations should consider whether the wheels of a mobility device could sink into the surface or cause the surface to move.





Openings in the surface



Openings in the surface can come from grates or other objects designed and placed in the ground to provide drainage or ventilation. This does not include openings in the trail’s surface caused by naturally occurring erosion.





Figure 2 – Elongated openings Figure 3 - Openings in the surface Openings on the surface of a recreational trail must not allow for the passage of an object that is greater than 20 mm in diameter. This is so that mobility device casters (small front wheels) or cane tips cannot pass through them.





For elongated openings (i.e., those that are not square), such as those on certain grates, length should be placed at a right angle to the direction of travel to prevent slipping. If openings, such as those on a grate, have a longer length than width, the length should be placed at a right angle to the direction of travel to prevent slipping.





Edge protection



When a recreational trail is located directly beside water or a drop-off, edge protection is required. A drop-off may exist, for example, where a trail is located beside a cliff edge or other sudden, significant change in level. Edge protection is a small curb built at the side of the trail that would stop, for example, a mobility device from rolling off the edge of the trail and allow a person with low or no vision to detect the edge of the trail. The top of the edge protection must be a minimum of 50 mm in height above the boardwalk surface.



In addition, the edge protection must be designed so it does not prevent water from draining away from the trail surface, which could cause erosion of the trail surface, water pooling and unsafe pathways. However, in cases where a protective barrier is already in place, such as a wall or a railing, edge protection is not required.





Trail entrance



The entrance to a recreational trail must provide a clear opening of between 850 mm and 1,000 mm. This applies whether the entrance uses a gate, bollard or any other entrance design that restricts access to the trail.



The minimum range allows for the passage of people who use mobility devices or service animals. At the same time, the maximum range will prevent the passage of devices not desirable on a pedestrian trail, such as snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles or small cars. A maximum range for entrances only applies to recreational trail entrances and does not apply to entrances elsewhere in the standard (where only a minimum is set out).





The entrance opening should be clear of any obstructions like handles, locks or





Signage





For new or redeveloped recreational trails, signage must be placed at each trail head and provide the following information to all trail users:  Trail length



 Surface type on the trail



 Average and minimum trail width



 Average and maximum running slope



 Average and maximum cross slope



 Location of amenities, where provided



A trail head refers to a point of access to a trail. They are commonly located close to a sidewalk or parking area. Organizations must identify which entrance/exit points to a recreational trail are trail heads to determine where the signage requirements will apply.



To help people with low or no vision and make the signage easier to read, the text on the signage must:



 Have high tonal contrast with its background



 Use sans serif font for its characters











Figure 4 - Trail signage



These requirements provide minimum standards for accessibility. Organizations have the flexibility to decide on the size of their signage, as well as what other information to provide, based on their specific needs.



Some organizations use other media to provide information about the recreational trail, such as park websites or brochures. Those media must also provide the same information listed on the signage as noted above, except when the media is used specifically for advertising, notices or promoting special events. For example, if an organization advertises the opening of a new trail in a newspaper, the accessibility information does not need to be included in the advertisement.





Technical Requirements for Beach Access Routes





Requirements as Stated in the Regulation





80.10 Obligated organizations shall ensure that beach access routes that they construct or redevelop, and that they intend to maintain, meet the following technical requirements:





1. A beach access route must have a minimum clear width of 1,000 mm.



2. A beach access route must have a clear height that provides a minimum head



room clearance of 2,100 mm above the beach access route.



3. The surface of a beach access route must be firm and stable.



4. Where the surface area of a beach access route is constructed, that is where



the surface area is not natural, the surface area must meet the following



requirements:



i. The maximum cross slope of the beach access route must be no more



than 1:50.



ii. The surface area must have a 1:2 bevel at changes in level between 6



mm and 13 mm.



iii. The surface area must have a maximum running slope of 1:10 at changes



in level between 14 mm and 200 mm.



iv. The surface area must have a ramp that meets the requirements of



section 80.13 where there are changes in level greater than 200 mm.



v. Any openings in the surface of the beach access route must not allow



passage of an object with a diameter of more than 20 mm.



vi. Any elongated openings in the beach access route must be oriented



approximately perpendicular to the direction of travel.



5. The maximum cross slope of a beach access route where the surface is not



constructed must be the minimum slope required for drainage.



6. The maximum running slope of a beach access route is 1:10. The entrance to a beach access route must have a minimum clear opening of 1,000 mm, whether the entrance includes a gate, bollard or other entrance design.





Intent of these Requirements



These requirements provide organizations with minimum requirements when constructing new or redeveloping existing beach access routes. The requirements in this section represent a baseline for accessibility. Organizations are free to exceed the minimum requirements and provide greater accessibility based on local need, design and/or individual budgets.

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2017



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 1-49 employees January 1, 2018





Implementing the Requirements





Minimum clear width



The minimum width of the walking surface of the route must be 1,000 mm. This is wide enough to accommodate a person using a mobility device, a cane or a service animal.



Organizations may choose to design their beach access routes to be wider than the minimum measurements required for accessibility. This decision can be based on a number of factors, including the length of the route or the anticipated amount of pedestrian traffic.





Minimum head room clearance



Head room clearance refers to the area above the surface of the beach access route that is within the range of the ground and a standing adult’s head. This area must be clear of any obstacle that a person may have to duck under, such as tree branches or signs. Obstacles in the overhead area above the beach access route are safety hazards for people with low or no vision.



The minimum head room clearance on a beach access route is 2,100 mm above the ground. Obstacles must not be located lower than this height.





Surface



A firm and stable surface resists indentations. For example, when a person walks or wheels across it, the surface should return to its original condition once this pressure is removed. The surface of a beach access route must be firm and stable so that the wheels of a mobility device or the tips of canes, crutches or walkers will not sink into the surface.



Temporary beach access routes can be made using manufactured goods, which can create firm and stable surfaces that are removable during the winter months. Organizations can choose from a variety of materials that will achieve a firm and stable surface. Organizations have the flexibility to choose the most appropriate surface material, considering maintenance requirements or budget.





Surface area



The surface of a beach access route may be constructed of non-natural materials such as asphalt or concrete. In this case, the cross slope must be no more than 1:50 which provides an almost flat route but still has enough slope to allow water to run off the surface.





Changes in level



There are common construction methods to help people using mobility devices move across areas where there are changes in elevation (such as curbs or sand dunes). The following measurements are only required for beach access routes that are constructed of non-natural materials such as asphalt or concrete:



 A 1:2 bevel must be used to move over a change in level between 6 mm and



13 mm. A bevel is defined as a small slope that helps create a smooth



transition that wheels can roll over.



 The running slope of 1:10 is the maximum ratio allowed when there is a



change in level between 14 mm and 200 mm. A slope that is steeper than



1:10 makes it harder for people using manual mobility devices to move



between levels because more force is needed either to travel up the slope or



to control the descent.



 Organizations must build a ramp that meets the requirements set out in



section 80.13 when the change in level is greater than 200 mm. (see section



80.13 for details).





Openings in the surface



When non-natural surfaces are used to construct beach access routes, openings in the surface are placed in them to provide drainage.



Openings on the surface of a beach access route must not allow for the passage of an object that is greater than 20 mm in diameter. This is so that mobility device casters (small front wheels) or cane tips cannot pass through them.



For elongated openings (i.e., those that are not square), such as those on certain grates, length should be placed at a right angle to the direction of travel to prevent slipping. If openings, such as those on a grate, have a longer length than width, the length should be placed at a right angle to the direction of travel to prevent slipping.





Maximum cross slope



Water must be able to drain off the surface of a beach access route made of natural materials. Natural surfaces may need a slightly steeper cross slope to prevent water from pooling on the surface.



The maximum cross slope allowed must not be steeper than what is required to allow water to drain from the surface.





Maximum running slope



The running slope on a beach access route must be no more than 1:10, regardless of the type of surface material. This will make it less steep and easier for people using manual mobility devices or those with stamina limitations to move along the route. For more information, please see the slope ratios section in the overview section.





Entrance to a beach access route



The entrance to a beach access route must provide a clear opening of at least 1,000 mm. This applies whether the entrance uses a gate, bollard or any other entrance design that restricts access to the trail. This clear opening provides enough space for people using accessibility devices, including beach wheelchairs2, or service animals to pass through the entrance.



The entrance opening should be clear of any obstructions like handles, locks or hinges that could reduce the width to less than 1,000 mm.





Technical Requirements Common to Recreational Trails and Beach Access Routes





Requirements as Stated in the Regulation





80.11 Obligated organizations shall ensure that where they construct or redevelop recreational trails and beach access routes that they intend to maintain, the recreational trails and beach access routes meet the technical requirements set out in this Part in respect of boardwalks and ramps.





Boardwalks



80.12 Where a recreational trail or beach access route is equipped with a boardwalk, the boardwalk must meet the following requirements:





1. The boardwalk must have a minimum clear width of 1,000 mm.



2. The boardwalk must have a clear height that provides a minimum headroom



clearance of 2,100 mm above the boardwalk.



3. The surface of the boardwalk must be firm and stable.



4. The boardwalk must not have any openings in the surface that allow the



passage of an object that has a diameter of more than 20 mm.



5. The boardwalk must have edge protection that is at least 50 mm in height.



6. If a boardwalk has running slopes that are steeper than 1:20, the running



slopes must meet the requirements for ramps set out in section 80.13.





Ramps



80.13 Where a recreational trail or beach access route is equipped with a ramp, the ramp must meet the following requirements:





1. The ramp must have a minimum clear width of 900 mm.





2. The ramp must have a clear height that provides a minimum headroom



clearance of 2,100 mm above the ramp.



3. The surface of the ramp must be firm and stable.



4. The ramp must have a maximum running slope of no more than 1:10.



5. The ramp must be provided with landings that meet the following



requirements:



i. Landings must be provided,



A. at the top and bottom of the ramp,



B. where there is an abrupt change in the direction of the ramp, and C. at horizontal intervals not greater than nine metres apart.



ii. Landings must be a minimum of 1,670 mm by 1,670 mm at the top and



bottom of the ramp and where there is an abrupt change in direction of the ramp.



iii. Landings must be a minimum of 1,670 mm in length and at least the same



width of the ramp for an in-line ramp.



iv. Landings must have a cross slope that is not steeper that 1:50.



6. The ramp must not have any openings in the surface that allow the passage



of an object that has a diameter of more than 20 mm.



7. The ramp must be equipped with handrails on both sides of the ramp and the



handrails must,



i. be continuously graspable along their entire length and have circular



cross-section with an outside diameter not less than 30 mm and not more than 40 mm, or any non-circular shape with a graspable portion that has a perimeter not less than 100 mm and not more than 155 mm and whose largest cross-sectional dimension is not more than 57 mm,



ii. be not less than 865 mm and not more than 965 mm high, measured



vertically from the surface of the ramp, except that handrails not meeting these requirements are permitted if they are installed in addition to the required handrail,



iii. terminate in a manner that will not obstruct pedestrian travel or create a



hazard,



iv. extend horizontally not less than 300 mm beyond the top and bottom of



the ramp, and



v. be provided with a clearance of not less than 50 mm between the handrail



and any wall to which it is attached. 8. Where a ramp is more than 2,200 mm in width,





i. one or more intermediate handrails which are continuous between



landings must be provided and located so that there is no more than 1,650 mm between handrails, and



ii. the handrails must meet the requirements set out in paragraph 7.



9. The ramp must have a wall or guard on both sides and where a guard is



provided, it must,

ramp surface.





Intent of these requirements



These requirements provide organizations with the minimum standards for accessibility when installing a boardwalk or a ramp on a recreational trail or beach access route to which the standard applies. Where a ramp or boardwalk is provided on a recreational trail or beach access route, organizations must ensure that the ramp or boardwalk meets the technical requirements set out in this section.



The requirements in this section represent a baseline for accessibility. Organizations are free to exceed the minimum requirements and provide greater accessibility based on local need, design and/or individual budgets.

Implementing the Requirements





Boardwalks



Boardwalks are generally described as planked structures built close to the ground in areas where water or wet soil can be found. They provide a dry path for users.





Minimum clear width



The minimum clear width of a boardwalk's walking surface must be 1,000 mm. This is consistent with the minimum width for a recreational trail or beach access route which is wide enough to accommodate a person using a mobility device, a cane or a service animal.



Organizations may decide to design their boardwalks to be wider than the minimum measurements required for accessibility based on the:  length of the boardwalk.



 location of any passing areas.



 anticipated amount of pedestrian traffic. Organizations should consider the width of the boardwalk in relation to the width of any connecting trails or beach access routes.





Minimum head room clearance



Head room clearance refers to the area above the surface of the boardwalk that is within the range of the ground and a standing adult’s head. This area must be clear of any obstacle that a person may have to duck under, such as tree branches or signs. Obstacles in the overhead area above the boardwalk are safety hazards for people who have low or no vision.



The minimum head room clearance over a boardwalk without obstructions is 2,100 mm above the route. Obstacles must not be located lower than this height.





Surface



The surface of the boardwalk must be firm and stable so that people using mobility devices can move across it safely.



Organizations can choose from a variety of materials that will achieve a firm and stable surface. Organizations have the flexibility to choose the most appropriate surface material, while still considering maintenance requirements or budget. The requirement for a firm and stable surface does not mean that organizations must use concrete or asphalt. When determining if a surface is firm and stable, organizations should consider whether the wheels of a mobility device could sink into the surface or cause the surface to move.





Openings in the surface



Openings in the surface can come from grates or the distance between board slats that are required to provide adequate drainage.



Openings on the surface of a boardwalk must not allow for the passage of an object that is greater than 20 mm in diameter. This is so that mobility device casters (small front wheels) or cane tips cannot pass through them.



or elongated openings (e.g. those that are not square), such as those on certain grates, length should be placed at a right angle to the direction of travel to prevent slipping. If openings, such as those on a grate, have a longer length than width, the length should be placed at a right angle to the direction of travel to prevent slipping.





Edge protection



Edge protection is a small curb built at the side of the boardwalk that would stop, for example, a mobility device from rolling off the edge of the boardwalk and allow people with low or no vision to detect the edge of the boardwalk. The top of the edge protection must be a minimum of 50 mm in height above the boardwalk surface.





Running slopes



If a boardwalk has a section that is steeper than 1:20, the section must meet the requirements for ramps set out in section 80.13 (below).



Ramps



Ramps help people with disabilities travel from one level to another. When an organization installs ramps on a trail or beach access route, the following accessibility requirements must be met. Organizations have the flexibility to determine when to use a ramp on a recreational trail or when to grade the surface of the trail to a more accessible slope ratio.





Minimum clear width



Ramps on recreational trails or beach access routes must have a minimum clear width of 900 mm, which is wide enough to:



 Accommodate a person using a mobility device; and  Narrow enough so that people who need to use the handrails can reach them.





Minimum head room clearance



Head room clearance refers to the overhead area above the surface of the ramp, which must be clear of any obstructions such as tree branches or signs, which may be a safety hazard for people who have low or no vision.



The minimum head room clearance over a ramp is 2,100 mm above the surface. Obstacles must not be located lower than this height.





Surface



A firm and stable surface resists indentations. For example, when a person walks or wheels across it, the surface should return to its original condition once this pressure is removed. The surface of the ramp must be firm and stable so that people using mobility devices can navigate it safely.



There are many ways to make ramp surfaces firm and stable. Organizations can choose the material that best meets their local needs and budgets.





Maximum running slope



If a ramp is being installed on a trail/beach access route, the ramp's running slope must not exceed 1:10.



This is slightly steeper than the maximum running slope of 1:15 required for



ramps on exterior paths of travel (Section 80.24). This is because the design of ramps in a natural environment may need to account for water drainage considerations. For example, pooling of surface water could make natural surfaces impassable.





Landings



If a ramp is being installed on a trail or beach access route, the ramp must include landings. Landings are level areas where people can stop safely and/or turn on the ramp. This is important for mobility device users who need enough space on the landing to align their devices with the direction of the ramp.



Landings are required:



 at the top and bottom of ramps;



 at least every 9 m on long in-line ramps; and



 when there is an abrupt change in direction of the ramp.





Landings must be a minimum of 1,670 mm by 1,670 mm at:  the top and bottom of the ramp; and



 where there is an abrupt change in direction of the ramp.



Landings on in-line ramps must be a minimum of 1,670 mm in length and the same width as the ramp. All landings must have a cross slope that is not steeper than 1:50. A cross slope of 1:50 allows for drainage but provides a mostly flat surface for a person using a mobility device to safely stop.





Openings in the surface



Openings in the surface of a ramp can come from grates designed to provide drainage.



Openings on a ramp must not allow for the passage of an object that is greater than 20 mm in diameter. This is so that mobility device casters (small front wheels) or cane tips cannot pass through them.





Handrails



When an organization decides to install a ramp on a trail/beach access route, it must have handrails on both sides to give people using manual mobility devices the ability to pull themselves up the ramp or to control their descent. Graspable handrails are important to lend support to ramp users and to help prevent falls.





The design and construction requirements for handrails include:  A continuously graspable surface along the entire length of the handrail  Specific dimension ranges for rounded or square handrails  Height range for handrail placement



 Direction on how the handrail should end at the top and bottom of the ramp,



so that it does not protrude into the pedestrian path of travel or create a



hazard



 Minimum clearance between the wall and the handrail so that people can get



their hands around it





Figure 5 - Intermediate handrails





Intermediate handrails



If a ramp is too wide, it may be difficult for a person using a mobility device to reach both handrails to pull themselves along the ramp. In cases where a ramp is more than 2,200 mm wide, organizations will be required to provide one or more additional handrails so a person using a mobility device has access to a handrail on either side of their chair. These handrails are called intermediate handrails.



Intermediate handrails must meet the same handrail requirements outlined in this section (see above under andrails). Organizations must provide intermediate handrails continuously between landings so that there is no more than 1,650 mm between any set of handrails.





Guards



Guards can consist of:



 A protective barrier with openings such as railings; or  A protective barrier without railings, such as a solid steel or glass safety



barrier. A guard must be at least 1,070 mm high and be designed so that climbing is not permitted.





A guard prevents ramp users from accidentally falling from one level to another over the edge of a ramp. This is very important where the area beside the ramp includes a sudden drop where someone could fall. In situations where a wall on any side protects the ramp user from falling over the edge of the ramp, a guard is not required. Where this is not the case, a guard is required.





Edge protection



Edge protection is a small curb constructed on the side of a ramp that prevents a mobility device from rolling over the side and allows people with low or no vision to detect the edge.



If a ramp’s railing or guard creates a space larger than 50 mm between the ramp surface and the solid guard, a small curb (edge protection) must fill the gap.





Figure 6 - Ramp features





Exceptions to the Requirements for Recreational Trails and Beach Access Routes





Requirements as Stated in the Regulation





Exceptions, limitations



80.14 Where an exception is permitted to a requirement that applies to a recreational trail or a beach access route, the exception applies solely, (a) to the particular requirement for which the exception is allowed and not to



any other requirement that applies to the recreational trail or beach access route; and



(b) to the portion of the recreational trail or beach access route for which it is



claimed and not to the recreational trail or beach access route in its entirety.





Exceptions, general



80.15 Exceptions to the requirements that apply to recreational trails and beach access routes are permitted where obligated organizations can demonstrate one or more of the following:





1. The requirements, or some of them, would likely affect the cultural heritage



value or interest of a property identified, designated or otherwise protected



under the Ontario Heritage Act as being of cultural heritage value or interest.



2. The requirements, or some of them, would affect the preservation of places



set apart as National Historic Sites of Canada by the Minister of the



Environment for Canada under the Canada National Parks Act (Canada).



3. The requirements, or some of them, would affect the national historic interest



or significance of historic places marked or commemorated under the Historic



Sites and Monuments Act (Canada).



4. The requirements, or some of them, might damage, directly or indirectly, the



cultural heritage or natural heritage on a property included in the United



Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation’s World Heritage



List of sites under the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World 5. There is a significant risk that the requirements, or some of them, would





adversely affect water, fish, wildlife, plants, invertebrates, species at risk,



ecological integrity or natural heritage values, whether the adverse effects are



direct or indirect.



6. It is not practicable to comply with the requirements, or some of them,



because existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition



of elements, spaces or features, such as where surrounding rocks bordering



the recreational trail or beach access route impede achieving the required



clear width.





Intent of these Requirements



There may be times when it is not possible to build recreational trails or beach access routes exactly to the minimum standards outlined in the regulation. This section permits exceptions based on specific grounds that take into account the historical, cultural or environmental value, significance and characteristics of the public space. For example, if a river, cliff edge, or other environmental feature limits the width of a trail in certain areas, then the standard would permit an organization to provide a narrower path on that specific area of the trail. Similarly, if the entrance to a trail has cultural or heritage value, it may not need to be altered to meet the requirements of the standard if the trail is redeveloped.



The intent of these exceptions is to balance the need to provide accessible public spaces that can be used and enjoyed by all with the particular constraints imposed by the location to be developed. The exceptions provide flexibility to make sure that organizations only apply exceptions where required and that they meet the requirements to the greatest extent possible.





Outdoor Public Use Eating Areas



Overview



Recreation is essential to living a full, happy and productive life. Everyone should have the same opportunities to enjoy their free time. Outdoor public use eating areas are part of the many recreational opportunities available across the province. Making outdoor eating areas accessible for people with disabilities helps them enjoy recreational experiences with family, friends and co-workers.



Requirements for Outdoor Public Use Eating Areas



Requirements as Stated in the Regulation





Outdoor public use eating areas, application



80.16 (1) The requirements in section 80.17 apply to newly constructed and redeveloped outdoor public use eating areas that an obligated organization, other than a small organization, intends to maintain and that fall within the description set out in subsection (2).



(2) The outdoor public use eating areas to which subsection (1) applies consist of tables that are found in public areas, such as in public parks, on hospital grounds and on university campuses and are specifically intended for use by the public as a place to consume food.





Outdoor public use eating areas, general requirements



80.17 Obligated organizations, other than small organizations, shall ensure that where they construct or redevelop outdoor public use eating areas that they intend to maintain, the outdoor public use eating areas meet the following requirements:



(1) A minimum of 20 per cent of the tables that are provided must be accessible to persons using mobility aids by having knee and toe clearance underneath the table and in no case shall there be fewer than one table in an outdoor public use eating area that meets this requirement. (2) The ground surface leading to and under tables that are accessible to persons using mobility aids must be level, firm and stable.





(3) Tables that are accessible to persons using mobility aids must have clear ground space around them that allows for a forward approach to the tables.





Intent of these Requirements



Outdoor public use eating areas are public areas with tables intended for use by the public as places to consume food. Examples include (but are not limited to) picnic tables in public parks, on hospital grounds or university campuses, and outdoor food courts in amusement parks or resorts.



The intent of the requirements is to address the need for a more inclusive experience for people with disabilities in outdoor eating areas where groups tend to gather.

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to comply with the requirements.





Implementing the Requirement





Application



These requirements apply to new and redeveloped outdoor public use eating areas that organizations, except small organizations, intend to maintain.



Number of Tables



When building new or redeveloping existing outdoor public use eating areas, organizations must provide accessible tables that people using mobility devices can use. Twenty percent of an organization's new stock of tables must be accessible. At a minimum, organizations must provide at least one accessible table in an eating area wherever they provide new tables.

Total number of new tables Number of new tables required to be



accessible



1-9 Minimum 1



10 2



15 2



30 6



100 20





Design of eating areas



The requirements for accessible tables describe the minimum requirements to make a table accessible while making sure that organizations have the flexibility to choose the design best suited for the environment, its budget and the customers it serves. Accessible tables must have enough clearance under the table to allow a person using a mobility device, such as a wheelchair, to access the table.





Surface area



The area approaching and surrounding the accessible tables must be level, firm, and stable so that a person using a mobility device can get to the table and move up to and around the table. A level surface is one with no noticeable slope, which makes it safer and easier for a person with a wheeled mobility device to approach and sit at an accessible table.





Outdoor Play Spaces





Overview



Play is a natural and important part of a child’s daily life and healthy development. Children with disabilities should have the same opportunities to play as all other children. Caregivers with disabilities should also have the opportunity to enjoy outdoor play spaces with their children. Accessible outdoor play spaces allow children and caregivers of all abilities to use play spaces together.



Requirements apply to new play spaces or existing play spaces that are redeveloped that an organization plans to maintain.



Organizations have the flexibility to design play spaces that are creative, fun and challenging for children of all ages and abilities. A number of resources are already available that can help organizations develop accessible play spaces for everyone. Annex H of the Canadian Standards Association’s Standard for Play Spaces (CAN/CSA Z614), and the Ontario Parks Association’s PlayAbility Toolkit are examples of useful resources that can help organizations determine the best way to incorporate accessibility features into their play spaces.



Requirements for Outdoor Play Spaces





Requirements as Stated in the Regulation





Outdoor play spaces, application



80.18 (1) This Part applies to newly constructed and redeveloped outdoor play spaces that an obligated organization, other than a small organization, intends to maintain and that fall within the description set out in subsection (2).



(2) The outdoor play spaces to which subsection (1) applies consist of an area that includes play equipment, such as swings, or features such as logs, rocks, sand or water, where the equipment or features are designed and placed to provide play opportunities and experiences for children and caregivers.





Outdoor play spaces, consultation requirements 80.19 When constructing new or redeveloping existing outdoor play spaces, obligated organizations, other than small organizations, shall consult on the needs of children and caregivers with various disabilities and shall do so in the following manner:





1. The Government of Ontario, the Legislative Assembly, designated public



sector organizations and large organizations must consult with the public and



persons with disabilities.



2. Municipalities must also consult with their municipal accessibility advisory



committees, where one has been established in accordance with subsection



29 (1) or (2) of the Act.





Outdoor play spaces, accessibility in design



80.20 When constructing new or redeveloping existing play spaces that they intend to maintain, obligated organizations, other than small organizations, shall, (a) incorporate accessibility features, such as sensory and active play



components, for children and caregivers with various disabilities into the



design of outdoor play spaces; and



(b) ensure that outdoor play spaces have a ground surface that is firm, stable



and has impact attenuating properties for injury prevention and sufficient



clearance to provide children and caregivers with various disabilities the



ability to move through, in and around the outdoor play space.





Intent of these Requirements



These requirements give organizations the flexibility to decide what accessible features are needed within any play space. This flexibility recognizes that given the needs of the local community, the space and cost will directly influence design decisions.

Affected Organizations Compliance Dates



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2017



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to comply with the requirements.





Implementing the Requirement





Application



Outdoor play spaces include equipment and/or features designed to provide play opportunities and experiences for children and caregivers of all abilities. These areas can include:



 manufactured play equipment (like monkey bars and swings).  natural play structures (like logs, rocks, sand or water).





Consultation requirements, outdoor play spaces



Consultation requirements aim to ensure play experiences are available for all users of a play space, including those with a range of disabilities.



An inclusive design process that incorporates feedback from the community will result in a better understanding of what makes a play space fun for all children.



Consultations with the public, including people with disabilities, can provide organizations with valuable insight about the diverse needs of children and caregivers with disabilities in the community. Consulting helps designers and decision makers understand potential accessibility barriers in order to develop design solutions that better meet the needs of the community.



Consultations should take place as early as possible in the planning and design process. Organizations can then weigh all considerations before they make decisions and finalize design plans.



The consultation requirement does not set out a particular process or way to consult, as it is recognized that consultations can be conducted in a wide variety of ways depending on the organization. This also allows organizations to use consultation processes they may already have in place and to combine consultations. For example, consultations on play spaces and recreational trails may be conducted at the same time, based on an organization’s need to do both.





For more information about accessible consultation processes, organizations



may wish to consult the Ontario Municipal Social Services Association’s Guides



for Accessible Community Engagement. These guides were developed through the Accessibility Directorate of Ontario’s EnAbling Change Program.



Municipalities with an Accessibility Advisory Committee, established in



accordance with subsection 29 (1) or (2) of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, must also consult with the committee.





Accessibility in design



Organizations must include accessibility in the design of any new or redeveloped play space. Accessibility features must be incorporated into the design of outdoor play spaces for children and caregivers with various disabilities.





Accessibility features can include (but are not limited to):  Sensory features, which are features that stimulate any of the senses, such



as sensory gardens (sight, smell and sound) or sandboxes (touch)



 Active play components, which are activities that include moderate to



vigorous bursts of high energy that raise the heart rate, such as climbing or



hop-scotch



Organizations must also make sure that outdoor play spaces have firm and stable ground surfaces to allow mobility devices to move easily, while balancing the need for safety and the prevention of injuries.



Surfaces that reduce the force of an impact or absorb the shock of a fall (‘impact attenuating’) should be located within the play space such as at the foot of slides and other play equipment. They do not need to be installed in the areas outside of the play space, such as the paths leading to or from the play space area. For example, if there is a sidewalk leading to the play space, it does not need to be replaced with a shock-absorbing surface.



Outdoor play spaces must be designed so there is enough clear space to allow all children and caregivers to move freely through, in and around the area.





Exterior Paths of Travel



Overview



Exterior paths of travel connect us to where we want to go. Exterior paths of travel differ from recreational trails – these are the sidewalks and walkways intended to provide a functional route from Point A to Point B, rather than those paths that are intended to provide a recreational experience.



When we leave our homes, we depend on these paths to take us to everything our communities have to offer. These paths are important links between places to work, travel, shop and play. They can be called by many names – sidewalks, walkways, multi-use paths and so on.



This section includes accessibility features for elements associated with exterior paths of travel. These include ramps, stairs, curb ramps, accessible pedestrian signals and rest areas.



This section is divided into the following seven parts: 1. 80.23 Exterior paths of travel



2. 80.24 Ramps



3. 80.25 Stairs



4. 80.26 Curb ramps



5. 80.27 Depressed curbs



6. 80.28 Accessible pedestrian signals



7. 80.29 Rest areas





All sections apply to all organizations except small private or not-for-profit organizations with 1-49 employees. The requirements apply to paths intentionally designed for pedestrian use. They do not apply to unplanned paths that pedestrians may use, such as short cuts.





Exterior Paths of Travel





Requirements as Stated in the Regulation



Exterior paths of travel, application



80.21 (1) This Part applies to newly constructed and redeveloped exterior paths of travel that are outdoor sidewalks or walkways designed and constructed for pedestrian travel and are intended to serve a functional purpose and not to provide a recreational experience.



(2) This Part does not apply to paths of travel regulated under Ontario Regulation 350/06 (Building Code) made under the Building Code Act, 1992.



Exterior paths of travel, general obligation



80.22 Obligated organizations, other than small organizations, shall ensure that any exterior paths of travel that they construct or redevelop and intend to maintain meet the requirements set out in this Part.



Exterior paths of travel, technical requirements



80.23 When constructing new or redeveloping existing exterior paths of travel that they intend to maintain, obligated organizations, other than small organizations, shall ensure that new and redeveloped exterior paths of travel meet the following requirements:



1. The exterior path must have a minimum clear width of 1,500 mm, but this



clear width can be reduced to 1,200 mm to serve as a turning space where



the exterior path connects with a curb ramp.



2. Where the head room clearance is less than 2,100 mm over a portion of the



exterior path, a rail or other barrier with a leading edge that is cane detectable



must be provided around the object that is obstructing the head room



clearance.



3. The surface must be firm and stable.



4. The surface must be slip resistant.





5. Where an exterior path has openings in its surface,



i. the openings must not allow passage of an object that has a diameter



of more than 20 mm, and



ii. any elongated openings must be oriented approximately perpendicular



to the direction of travel.



6. The maximum running slope of the exterior path must be no more than 1:20,



but where the exterior path is a sidewalk, it can have a slope of greater than



1:20, but it cannot be steeper than the slope of the adjacent roadway.



7. The maximum cross slope of the exterior path must be no more that 1:20,



where the surface is asphalt, concrete or some other hard surface, or no



more that 1:10 in all other cases.



8. The exterior path must meet the following requirements:



i. It must have a 1:2 bevel at changes in level between 6 mm and 13



mm.



ii. It must have a maximum running slope of 1:8 or a curb ramp that



meets the requirement of section 80.26 at changes in level of greater than 13 mm and less than 75 mm.



iii. It must have a maximum running slope of 1:10 or a curb ramp that



meets the requirement of section 80.26 at changes in level of 75 mm or greater and 200 mm or less.



iv. It must have a ramp that meets the requirements of section 80.24



and changes in level of greater than 200 mm.



9. The entrance to the exterior path of travel must provide a minimum clear opening of 850 mm, whether the entrance includes a gate, bollard or other entrance design.





Intent of these Requirements



The intent of the requirements for sidewalks and walkways is to provide minimum standards of accessibility to make sure they are safe and useable for all pedestrians, including people using mobility devices and caregivers with strollers. The consistent use of minimum requirements will support the mobility needs of people with disabilities and promote better health and safety outcomes for all pedestrians.

Designated public sector organizations with 1-49 employees January 1, 2016



Designated public sector organizations with 1-49 employees January 1, 2016



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2017



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to comply with the requirements.





Implementing the Requirements





Application and general obligation



The technical requirements outlined in this section apply to all new or redeveloped outdoor sidewalks and walkways designed for pedestrian travel and intended to serve a functional purpose (as opposed to a recreational experience), that the organization intends to maintain, based on the compliance dates outlined in section 80.5.



These requirements do not apply to any exterior paths of travel (barrier-free or otherwise) already regulated under Ontario’s Building Code.



Please note that, although the standard refers to the 2006 Building Code, the 2012 Building Code has replaced it in its entirety.





Minimum clear width



The minimum clear width of a new or redeveloped outdoor sidewalk or walkway must be 1,500 mm. This is wide enough to accommodate a greater range of two-way traffic, including pedestrians who use mobility devices.





The minimum 1,500 mm clear width must be free from any obstructions. Any obstructions such as advertising boards, planters and newspaper boxes must be placed outside of the pedestrian route to meet the minimum 1,500 mm clear width requirement.





Where there is a curb ramp on the sidewalk or walkway, the minimum clear width can be reduced to 1,200 mm to accommodate the flared sides and base ramp features of the curb ramp design.





Figure 7 – Clear width on a sidewalk



Minimum head room clearance



Head room clearance refers to the area above the surface of the sidewalk/ walkway. This area must be clear of any obstacle that a person may have to duck under, such as tree branches or signs. Obstacles in the overhead area are safety hazards for people who have low or no vision.



The optimal head room clearance on a sidewalk or walkway is 2,100 mm above the sidewalk/walkway surface. Obstacles should preferably not be located within this height.



In cases where the minimum head room clearance cannot be achieved due to existing infrastructure, a barrier capable of being detected by a cane, such as a rail, with a hard edge should be placed beneath any object in the head room area. The barrier will help cane users detect the object.





Figure 8 - Minimum head room clearance





Surface



Sidewalks and walkways must be constructed to withstand the pressure of pedestrian traffic.



A firm surface is one that resists indentations. For example, when a person walks or wheels across it, the surface should return to its original condition once this pressure is removed.



Surfaces must also minimize the likelihood of slips. A number of factors can contribute to slips and falls, such as moisture, types of footwear or methods of walking. Because of this variation, organizations are responsible for determining the best way to achieve a slip-resistant surface on sidewalks/walkways. Openings in the surface





Openings in the surface of a sidewalk or walkway can come from grates or other objects designed and placed in the ground to provide drainage. This does not include openings in the surface caused by naturally occurring erosion.





Openings on a sidewalk or walkway must not allow for the passage of an object that is greater than 20 mm in diameter. This will help to minimize injuries that occur when mobility device casters (small front wheels) and tips of canes become stuck in wider openings. Openings that are smaller can affect the operation of underground ventilation systems that require larger openings for airflow.





For elongated openings (e.g. those that are not square), such as those on certain grates, length should be placed at a right angle to the direction of travel to prevent slipping. If openings, such as those on a grate, have a longer length than width, the length should be placed at a right angle to the direction of travel to prevent slipping.





Running slope



The running slope of outdoor sidewalks and walkways should not exceed a slope ratio of 1:20, except as where set out in the sections below. For example, an increase in level of one metre on a sidewalk or walkway must be spread across 20 metres of length. The same ratio can be applied to other units of measure, such as inches, centimetres, feet and so on. Limiting the slope ratio to 1:20 will help to allow pedestrians with restricted mobility to navigate pedestrian routes independently.



When the natural terrain results in roadways that are steeper than 1:20, the slope of the sidewalk can match the roadway but not exceed it. In all other cases, sidewalks and walkways must always be constructed with a maximum slope of 1:20.





Cross slope



The type of surface on a sidewalk or walkway can affect drainage. When water pools, it can make pedestrian travel difficult and sometimes even dangerous. For example, pooled water can freeze in the winter and can increase the chances of pedestrian slips and falls.





Unpaved surfaces are sometimes more difficult to drain. In these cases, cross slopes can be steeper (1:10) to allow for better drainage.





Because paved surfaces are easier to drain, cross slopes on these types of sidewalks or walkways must be more gentle (1:20).



Cross slope requirements represent maximum values that allow for the construction of gentler slopes where drainage does not present a problem.





Changes in level



For pedestrian routes to be safe and useable by all, it is important that people using mobility devices are able to move from one level to another along the sidewalk or walkway. Requirements for bevels, slopes, curb ramps and ramps on sidewalks and walkways are required at different degrees of level change. The greater the change in level, the gentler the slope must be. Where possible, changes in level should be reduced to make exterior paths of travel as flat as possible. This will also reduce the need to install other features, such as ramps or stairs.



Bevels, slopes, curb ramps and ramps are required on sidewalks and walkways where there are changes in level along the surface of the route. Where a small change in level exists, a bevel can help a person using a mobility device to move over the level change. These requirements do not apply to changes in level resulting from the general slope of the sidewalk or walkway.





Entrances



Sidewalk or walkway entrances must have a minimum clear opening of 850 mm, whether the entrance is a gate, a bollard or any other entrance design. This measurement provides a clear passage for people who use mobility devices, canes and support animals.



The entrance opening should be clear of any obstructions like handles, locks or hinges that could reduce the width to less than 850 mm.





Ramps



Requirements as Stated in the Regulation



Exterior paths of travel, ramps



80.24 (1) Where an exterior path of travel is equipped with a ramp, the ramp must meet the following requirements:



1. The ramp must have a minimum clear width of 900 mm.



2. The surface of the ramp must be firm and stable.



3. The surface of the ramp must be slip resistant.



4. The ramp must have a maximum running slope of no more than 1:15.



5. The ramp must be provided with landings that meet the following



requirements:



i. Landings must be provided,



a. At the top and bottom of the ramp,



b. Where there is an abrupt change in direction of the ramp, and c. At horizontal intervals not greater than nine metres apart.



ii. Landings must be a minimum of 1,670 mm by 1,670 mm at the top



and bottom of the ramp and where there is an abrupt change in direction of the ramp.



iii. Landings must be a minimum of 1,670 mm in length and at least



the same width of the ramp for an in-line ramp.



iv. Landings must have a cross slope that is not steeper than 1:50.



6. Where a ramp has openings in its surface,



i. the openings must not allow passage of an object that has a



diameter of more than 20 mm, and



ii. any elongated openings must be oriented approximately



perpendicular to the direction of travel.



7. A ramp must be equipped with handrails on both sides of the ramp and the



handrails must,



i. be continuously graspable along their entire length and have



circular cross-section with an outside diameter not less than 30 mm and not more than 40 mm, or any non-circular shape with a





graspable portion that has a perimeter not less than 100 mm and not more than 155 mm and whose largest cross-sectional dimension is not more than 57 mm,



ii. be not less than 865 mm and not more than 965 mm high,



measured vertically from the surface of the ramp, except that handrails not meeting these requirements are permitted provided they are installed in addition to the required handrail,



iii. terminate in a manner that will not obstruct pedestrian travel or



create a hazard,



iv. extend horizontally not less than 300 mm beyond the top and



bottom of the ramp,



v. be provided with a clearance of not less than 50 mm between the



handrail and any wall to which it is attached, and



vi. be designed and constructed such that handrails and their supports



will withstand the loading values obtained from the non-concurrent application of a concentrated load not less than 0.9 kN applied at any point and in any direction for all handrails and a uniform load not less than 0.7 kN/metre applied in any direction to the handrail.



8. Where the ramp is more than 2,200 mm in width,



i. one or more intermediate handrails which are continuous between



landings shall be provided and located so that there is no more than 1,650 mm between handrails, and



ii. the handrails must meet the requirements set out in paragraph 7.



9. The ramp must have a wall or guard on both sides and where a guard is



provided, it must,



i. be not less than 1,070 mm measured vertically to the top of the



guard from the ramp surface, and



ii. be designed so that no member, attachment or opening located



between 140 mm and 900 mm above the ramp surface being protected by the guard will facilitate climbing.



10. The ramp must have edge protection that is provided,



i. with a curb at least 50 mm high on any side of the ramp where no



solid enclosure or solid guard is provided, or



ii. with railings or other barriers that extend to within 50 mm of the



finished ramp surface.



(2) In this section,





“kN” means kilonewtons.





Intent of these Requirements



Ramps help people with disabilities safely and independently move from one level to another on public pedestrian routes. Ramps should not be too steep and should provide enough turning space for:



 users of wheeled mobility devices



 families with strollers



 visitors with luggage

Affected Organizations Compliance Dates



Ontario Government and Legislative Assembly January 1, 2015



Designated public sector organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2016



Designated public sector organizations with 1-49 employees January 1, 2016



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2017



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to comply with the requirements.



Implementing the Requirements





Application



This section addresses technical requirements for ramps including:  Maximum slope ratio;



 Protective guardrails;



 Handrails; and



 Landings to provide space to turn around Organizations must comply with the ramp requirements in this section when installing them on exterior paths of travel, but not for ramps connected to a building.





Minimum clear width



Ramps must have a minimum clear width of 900 mm. This is wide enough to accommodate a range of wheeled mobility devices. It is also narrow enough to allow people with different mobility challenges to reach across and grasp both handrails for support as they travel up or down the ramp.





Surface



Ramps must be able to withstand the pressure of pedestrian traffic. A firm surface resists indentations. For example, when a person walks or wheels across it, the surface should return to its original condition once this pressure is removed.





Surfaces must also minimize the likelihood of slips. The regulation does not provide technical specifications for slip resistance. A number of factors can contribute to a fall, such as moisture, different kinds of footwear and methods of walking. Because of this variation, organizations are responsible for determining the best way to achieve this requirement.





Running slope



The maximum slope ratio on a ramp is 1:15. This makes it easier for people using mobility devices to go up and down the ramp.



A gentle ramp slope means that users of wheeled mobility devices can use less effort to climb the ramp and maintain a safe, controlled descent. This supports the safe use of the ramp, particularly when it becomes slippery due to poor weather conditions.





Landings



Landings are level areas where people can stop safely and/or turn on the ramp. This is important for mobility device users who need enough space on the landing to align their devices with the direction of the ramp.





Landings are required:



 at the top and bottom of ramps



 every 9 m on long in-line ramps; and,



 when there is an abrupt change in direction of the ramp.





Landings must be:



 a minimum of 1,670 mm by 1,670 mm at the top and bottom of the ramp; and



 where there is an abrupt change in direction of the ramp.



Landings on in-line ramps must be a minimum of 1,670 mm in length and the same width of the ramp.



All landings must have a cross slope that is not steeper than 1:50. A cross slope of 1:50 allows for drainage but provides a mostly flat surface for a person using a mobility device to safely stop.





Openings in the surface



Openings in the surface can come from grates or other objects designed and placed in the ground to provide drainage. This does not include openings in the surface caused by naturally occurring erosion.



Openings in the surface of a ramp must not allow for the passage of an object that is greater than 20 mm in diameter. This is so that mobility device casters (small front wheels) or cane tips cannot pass through them.



For elongated openings (i.e., those that are not square), such as those on certain grates, length should be placed at a right angle to the direction of travel to prevent slipping. If openings, such as those on a grate, have a longer length than width, the length should be placed at a right angle to the direction of travel to prevent slipping.





Handrails



When an organization installs a ramp on an exterior path of travel, it must have handrails on both sides to give people using a mobility device, such as a wheelchair, the ability to pull themselves up the ramp or to control their descent. Graspable handrails are important to lend support to ramp users and to help prevent falls.





The design and construction requirements for handrails include:  A continuously graspable surface along the entire length of the handrail  Specific dimension ranges for rounded or square handrails  Height range for handrail placement



 Direction on how the handrail should end at the top and bottom of the ramp,



so that it does not protrude into the pedestrian path of travel or create a



hazard



 Minimum clearance between the wall and the handrail so that people can get



their hands around it



 A load-bearing capacity to withstand the weight of a person who uses the



handrail to stand





Intermediate handrails



If a ramp is too wide, it may be difficult for people using a mobility device to reach both handrails and pull themselves along the ramp. In cases where a ramp is more than 2,200 mm wide, organizations must provide one or more additional handrails so a person using a mobility device, such as a wheelchair, has access to a handrail on either side of their chair. These handrails are called intermediate handrails.



Intermediate handrails must meet the same handrail requirements outlined in this section (see above). Organizations must provide intermediate handrails continuously between landings so that there is no more than 1,650 mm between any set of handrails.





Guards



Guards can consist of:



 protective barriers with openings such as railings, or  protective barriers without railings, such as solid steel or glass safety barriers





A guard prevents ramp users from accidentally falling over the edge of a ramp from one level to another. This is very important where the area beside the ramp includes a sudden drop where someone could fall.





In situations where a wall on any side protects the ramp user from falling over the edge, a guard is not required. Where this is not the case, a guard is required.





Edge protection



Edge protection is a small curb constructed on the side of the ramp that prevents a mobility device from rolling over the side and provides people with low or no vision with a detectable edge. Edge protection must be provided on a ramp except when railings or guards are placed lower than 50 mm above the ramp surface.





Stairs



Requirements as Stated in the Regulation



Exterior path of travel, stairs



80.25 Where stairs connect to exterior paths of travel, the stairs must meet the following requirements:



1. The surface of the treads must have a finish that is slip resistant.



2. Stairs must have uniform risers and runs in any one flight.



3. The rise between successive treads must be between 125 mm and 180 mm.



4. The run between successive steps must be between 280 mm and 355 mm.



5. Stairs must have closed risers.



6. The maximum nosing projection on a tread must be no more than 38 mm,



with no abrupt undersides.



7. Stairs must have high tonal contrast markings that extend the full tread width



of the leading edge of each step.





8. Stairs must be equipped with tactile walking surface indicators that are built in



or applied to the walking surface, and the tactile walking surface indicators



must,



i. have raised tactile profiles,



ii. have a high tonal contrast with the adjacent surface,



iii. be located at the top of all flights of stairs, and



iv. extend the full tread width to a minimum depth of 610 mm



commencing one tread depth from the edge of the stair.



9. Handrails must be included on both sides of stairs and must satisfy the



requirements set out in paragraph 7 of subsection 80.24 (1).



10. A guard must be provided that is not less than 920 mm, measured vertically



to the top of the guard from a line drawn through the outside edges of the



stair nosings and 1,070 mm around the landings and is required on each side



of a stairway where the difference in elevation between ground level and the



top of the stair is more than 600 mm but, where there is a wall, a guard is not



required on that side.



11. Where stairs are more than 2,200 mm in width,



i. one or more intermediate handrails that are continuous between



landings must be provided and located so there is no more than 1,650 mm between handrails, and



ii. the handrails must satisfy the requirements set out in paragraph 7 of



subsection 80.24 (1).





Intent of these Requirements



The requirements for stairs will improve safety and accessibility for all stair users. Many people with disabilities do not use wheeled mobility devices. Falls on stairs are a major threat to a person’s health, independence and confidence.



Stairs are a barrier for people who use mobility devices. They are not the best choice for moving from one level to another, and should not be used as part of an exterior path of travel. It is recommended that stairs only be used as an alternate way of negotiating level changes where barrier-free access is already provided. Table 58 - When do Organizations have to Comply





Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

Designated public sector organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2016



Designated public sector organizations with 1-49 employees January 1, 2016



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2017



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to comply with the requirements.



Implementing the Requirements





Application



This section includes requirements for stairs connected to exterior paths of travel. Technical requirements include:



 minimum and maximum dimensions for each step



 tactile walking surface indicators



 protective guardrails



 handrails





Similar to ramps, organizations must meet the requirements outlined in this section when installing stairs where they connect to an exterior path of travel, but not for stairs that are connected to a building.





Organizations may consider installing stairs beside a sloped walkway or ramp. People with limited stamina may prefer to climb a short flight of stairs rather than take a longer, gradually inclined route. Stairs are a barrier for many forms of disability, and as such should not be the only way of continuing along an exterior path of travel.





Slip resistance



Surfaces on stairs must minimize the likelihood of slips. A number of factors can contribute to slips and falls, such as moisture, types of footwear or methods of walking. Because of this variation, organizations are responsible for determining the best way to achieve a slip-resistant surface on stairs.





Risers and runs



Steps in a flight of stairs should have the same dimensions. The repetitive step pattern of climbing up and down stairs creates the expectation that each step size is the same. Steps of different sizes can cause falls and serious injuries. Consistent dimensions for risers and runs will result in stairs being as safe as possible, which will support Ontario’s aging population and people with disabilities. This will allow for continued independence and mobility by all users.



The requirements for stairs include minimum and maximum step dimensions for rise (the vertical position) and run (the depth of the step ‘tread’). These dimensions are consistent with research findings for stair usability and safety. They should reduce the risk of overstepping short runs or experiencing a misstep between risers. The range between minimum and maximum dimensions is required for safety and provides designers with the flexibility to account for physical site characteristics unique to each public space setting.





Figure 9 - Stair features





Closed risers



Risers are the vertical sections between steps. Closed risers on stairs are required because they help reduce the likelihood of falls. Open risers can cause people using canes to have trouble maintaining their balance if their cane slides into the opening. People with vision loss can also experience vertigo due to the “strobing” effect of the stair treads and the light between each tread. In addition, people of all abilities can overstep and hurt themselves with open risers.





Nosings



Some steps protrude past the riser – these are called nosings. Maximum requirements for nosing projection on stairs will help prevent people from catching their toes on the edge of the step and tripping when climbing a stairway. This will help people with limited motor coordination, a shuffling gait, poor sensation in their feet or those that use prostheses.





High tonal contrast markings



High tonal contrast markings at the leading edge of each step make it easier for people to use stairs safely and independently. Tonal contrast strips help people with reduced sight visually detect the end of each step. This helps stair users avoid overstepping the stair tread, which could result in falls and injuries.





Tactile walking surface indicators



Tactile walking surface indicators provide important cues for people with low or no vision. These indicators can alert all pedestrians to potential hazards, such as stair edges that can result in falls or injuries.





Tactile walking surface indicators are required to:



 be placed at the top of stairs.



 have raised tactile profiles. This makes them detectible underfoot for



someone who cannot visually detect the edge of a step



 have a high tonal contrast with the surrounding surface  cover the full tread width and be set back from the stair edge. They should not



be located right at the edge of the step





Organizations have the flexibility to determine the specifications for tactile walking surface indicators. They can review existing best practice standards or they can conduct pilot studies to determine the best option. The design specifications selected should take into account:





 the needs of people with disabilities



 the potential for tripping hazards and



 maintenance requirements





Handrails



Stairs that connect to exterior paths of travel must have handrails that meet the same requirements as handrails on ramps.



Handrails are required on both sides of stairs to guide and support people travelling in either direction. They provide important non-visual guidance cues for stair users by helping them anticipate successive steps and landings. Graspable handrails are also important to lend support to stair users and to help prevent falls.





The design and construction requirements for handrails include:  a continuously graspable surface along the entire length of the handrail  specific dimension ranges for rounded or square handrails  height range for handrail placement



 direction on how the handrail should end at the top and bottom of the stairs,



so that it does not protrude into the pedestrian path of travel or create a



hazard



 minimum clearance between the wall and the handrail so that people can get



their hands around it



 a load-bearing capacity to withstand the weight of a person who uses the



handrail to steady themselves





Guards



Guards can consist of:



 protective barriers with openings such as railings, or  protective barriers without railings, such as solid steel or glass safety barriers A guard prevents stair users from falling from one level to another. This is particularly important where the area beside the stairs includes a drop where someone could fall and be injured.





Guards are required on stairs except where there is a wall beside the flight of stairs, or where the elevation between the ground level and the top of the stair is less than 600mm.





Intermediate handrails



In cases where a flight of stairs is wider than 2,200 mm, organizations are required to provide one or more additional handrails so a person needing the stability assistance of a handrail has access to it. These handrails are called intermediate handrails.



Intermediate handrails must meet the same handrail specifications outlined in the ramps section. Organizations must provide intermediate handrails continuously between landings so there is no more than 1,650 mm between any set of handrails.





Curb Ramps





Requirements as Stated in the Regulation



Exterior paths of travel, curb ramps



80.26 (1) Where a curb ramp is provided on an exterior path of travel, the curb ramp must align with the direction of travel and meet the following requirements:



1. The curb ramp must have a minimum clear width of 1,200 mm, exclusive of



any flared sides.



2. The running slope of the curb ramp must,



1. be a maximum of 1:8, where elevation is less than 75 mm, and 2. be a maximum of 1:10, where elevation is 75 mm or greater and



200 mm or less.



3. The maximum cross slope of the curb ramp must be no more than 1:50. 4. The maximum slope on the flared side of the curb ramp must be no more





than 1:10.



5. Where the curb ramp is provided at a pedestrian crossing, it must have tactile



walking surface indicators that,



i. have raised tactile profiles,



ii. have a high tonal contrast with the adjacent surface,



iii. are located at the bottom of the curb ramp,



iv. are set back between 150 mm and 200 mm from the curb edge,



v. extend the full width of the curb ramp, and



vi. are a minimum of 610 mm in depth.



(2) In this section,



“curb ramp” means a ramp that is cut through a curb or that is built up to a curb.





Intent of these Requirements



The requirements for curb ramps will help people with disabilities move from one level to another safely and independently on public pedestrian routes.





Where pedestrians cross a roadway, curb ramps should provide a smooth transition for mobility device users. Tactile walking surface indicators will warn people with low or no vision that they are entering a potentially hazardous area.

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to comply with the requirements.



Implementing the Requirements





Application



This section includes requirements for curb ramps, including  their alignment with the direction of travel



 their slope ratio and



 placement of tactile walking surface indicators





These requirements apply to curb ramps typically found on municipal sidewalks and in park settings.





Align with direction of travel



An important requirement for all curb ramps is that they must align with the direction of travel. This can mean aligning the curb ramp with a pedestrian crossing (where there is one), or aligning the curb ramp with the general direction of the pedestrian route (where no pedestrian crossing is present).



It is very important to align a curb ramp with a pedestrian crossing to reduce the risk of pedestrians accidentally stepping into the path of oncoming vehicular traffic. This requirement will improve safety for people with low or no vision, those using mobility devices, families with strollers and visitors with luggage.





Minimum clear width



The minimum clear width of a new or redeveloped curb ramp must be 1,200 mm (exclusive of any flared sides). This is required so pedestrians using mobility devices and those travelling on foot can use the curb ramp at the same time. Organizations should consider building wider curb ramps at busier, more heavily used intersections.





Slope



There is no minimum measure required for the slope of a curb ramp. Instead, the regulation allows for different maximum slopes based on the elevation change. Gentler slopes are required at greater elevation changes, and steeper slopes are permitted at smaller elevation changes. Mobility device users are able to negotiate steeper slopes when the incline is small, so accessibility is not reduced.





Tactile walking surface indicators



Tactile walking surface indicators provide important cues for people with low or no vision. These indicators can alert all pedestrians to potential hazards, such as the imminent danger of oncoming traffic.





Tactile walking surface indicators are required to:



 have raised tactile profiles. This makes them detectible underfoot for



someone that cannot visually detect the curb edge. Depressed grooves in



concrete do not meet this requirement



 have a high tonal contrast with the surrounding surface  be placed at the bottom of curb ramps so that they can be detected before



entering the roadway, but set back from the curb edge. They should not be



placed right before the roadway



 extend the full width of the curb ramp



 have a minimum depth of 610mm





Tactile walking surface indicators are not required when curb ramps are not located at pedestrian crossings, such as those found on side streets.



Organizations have the flexibility to determine the specifications for tactile walking surface indicators. They can review existing best practice standards or they can conduct pilot studies to determine the best option. The design specifications selected should take into account:



 the needs of people with disabilities



 the potential for tripping hazards, and



 maintenance requirements





Depressed Curbs





Requirements as Stated in the Regulation



Exterior paths of travel, depressed curbs



80.27 (1) Where a depressed curb is provided on an exterior path of travel, the depressed curb must meet the following requirements:



1. The depressed curb must have a maximum running slope of 1:20.



2. The depressed curb must be aligned with the direction of travel.



3. Where the depressed curb is provided at a pedestrian crossing, it must



have tactile walking surface indicators that,



i. have raised tactile profiles,



ii. have high tonal contrast with the adjacent surface,



iii. are located at the bottom portion of the depressed curb that is flush



with the roadway,



iv. are set back between 150 mm and 200 mm from the curb edge, and



v. are a minimum of 610 mm in depth.



(2) In this section,





“depressed curb” means a seamless gradual slope at transitions between sidewalks and walkways and highways, and is usually found at intersections.





Intent of these Requirements



The requirements for depressed curb ramps are intended to improve safety and usability of outdoor sidewalks and walkways for all pedestrians, particularly people with disabilities.

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to comply with the requirements.



Implementing the Requirements





Application



This section includes requirements for depressed curbs. Depressed curbs are a type of curb ramp design that can wrap around a corner intersection, rather than requiring two dedicated curb ramps for each direction of travel.





Organizations have the flexibility to determine the choice of depressed curb ramp design for any elevation change or pedestrian crossing, provided it meets the requirements of the regulation. This choice can be based on a number of factors like volume of pedestrian traffic, available space and other site-specific characteristics.





Running slope



A maximum running slope of 1:20 is required for depressed curbs. This will provide a gradual, seamless transition from sidewalks to pedestrian crossing areas for people using mobility devices, families with strollers and visitors with luggage.





Figure 10 - Running slope





Align with direction of travel



An important requirement for all curb ramps, including depressed curbs, is that they must align with the direction of travel. This can mean aligning the depressed ramp with a pedestrian crossing (where there is one), or aligning it with the general direction of the pedestrian route (where no pedestrian crossing is present).



It is very important to align a depressed curb with a pedestrian crossing to reduce the risk of pedestrians accidentally veering into the path of oncoming vehicular traffic. This requirement will improve pedestrian safety for people with low or no vision, those using mobility devices, families with strollers and visitors with luggage.



Tactile walking surface indicators



Since depressed curbs are “flush” (at the same level) with the roadway, tactile walking surface indicators are required at pedestrian crossings. It is important to provide tactile walking surface indicators here, because they compensate for the absence of a hard detectable curb edge that would otherwise be used to indicate where the sidewalk ends and roadway begins.



Tactile walking surface indicators are required to:



 have raised tactile profiles. This makes them detectible underfoot for



someone who cannot visually detect the curb edge  be placed at the bottom of depressed curbs so they can be detected before





entering the roadway, but set back between 150mm and 200mm from the



curb edge. They should not be placed right before the roadway



 have a minimum depth of 610mm





Tactile walking surface indicators are not required when curb ramps are not located at pedestrian crossings, such as those found on side streets.



Organizations have the flexibility to determine further specifications for tactile walking surface indicators. They can review existing best practice standards or they can conduct pilot studies to determine the best option. The design specifications selected should take into account:



 the needs of people with disabilities



 the potential for tripping hazards, and



 maintenance requirements.





Accessible Pedestrian Signals



Requirements as Stated in the Regulation



Exterior paths of travel, accessible pedestrian signals 80.28 (1) Where new pedestrian signals are being installed or existing pedestrian signals are being replaced at a pedestrian crossover, they must be accessible pedestrian signals.



(2) Accessible pedestrian signals must meet the following requirements:



1. They must have a locator tone that is distinct from a walk indicator tone.



2. They must be installed within 1,500 mm of the edge of the curb.



3. They must be mounted at a maximum of 1,100 mm above ground level.



4. They must have tactile arrows that align with the direction of crossing.



5. They must include both manual and automatic activation features.



6. They must include both audible and vibro-tactile walk indicators.





(3) Where two accessible pedestrian signal assemblies are installed on the same corner, they must be a minimum of 3,000 mm apart.



(4) Where the requirements in subsection (3) cannot be met because of site constraints or existing infrastructure, two accessible pedestrian signal assemblies can be installed on a single post, and when this occurs, a verbal announcement must clearly state which crossing is active.



(5) In this section,



“pedestrian crossover” means a pedestrian crossover as defined in subsection 1 (1) of



the Highway Traffic Act.





Intent of these Requirements



The requirements for accessible pedestrian signals will improve safety and usability of pedestrian crossings for people with various disabilities.



Many people who do not have disabilities rely on unmistakable visual cues at pedestrian crossings to tell them when it is safe to cross the road. These can include “walk/don’t walk” pedestrian crossing signal indicators, crowding of other pedestrians at crossing entry points and the movement of vehicular traffic. People who cannot rely on these cues need information for safe crossing to be provided in an audible or vibro-tactile form.



These requirements provide pedestrians with various disabilities with similar opportunities to travel independently and safely, similar to those commonly enjoyed by other pedestrians.

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to comply with the requirements.





Implementing the Requirements





Application



This section includes requirements for accessible pedestrian signals, which are found at pedestrian crossovers (such as crosswalks) or intersections, that provide audible signals that indicate when it is safe to cross the road.





Requirements for accessible pedestrian signals in the Standard include:  a locator tone



 proximity to edge of curb



 tactile push-button arrows



 mounting height distance



 capacity for both manual and automatic activation, and  audible and vibro-tactile walk indicators.





Figure 11 - Accessible pedestrian signals Accessible pedestrian signals are required where new pedestrian crossing signals are installed at crosswalks or intersections, such as in a newly- constructed urban commercial district. If organizations do not plan to install any pedestrian crossing signals at a particular intersection, then they are not required to install these devices. For example, a municipality may not plan to install pedestrian crossing signals in a new suburban sub-division with little foot traffic.





Accessible pedestrian signals are also required when the existing pedestrian crossing signals at a crosswalk or intersection are replaced with new ones. This provides an opportunity to make existing pedestrian crossing more accessible.



Replacing light bulbs or parts of a pedestrian crossing signal system will not trigger the requirement to install accessible pedestrian signals. These are considered regular maintenance activities.





Locator tone



Accessible pedestrian signal systems must include a locator tone. This will help people with various disabilities find the activation unit and press the button to cross the road. The locator tone must be different from the walk indicator tone. This will tell pedestrians whether it is safe to cross the road in the direction they are travelling.





Proximity to curb edge and mounting height



The push button signal device/box must be located within 1,500 mm of the curb edge. This gives pedestrians enough time to press the button and return to the curb edge to respond to the walk indicator tone. These devices can also be located closer to the curb edge.



The device must not be placed more than 1,100 mm above the ground, so that someone using a mobility device can reach it.





Tactile arrow



A tactile arrow-shaped button pointing in the direction of travel is required and helps pedestrians locate the pedestrian crossing at a crosswalk or intersection. It also helps pedestrians align themselves with the direction of travel and remain within the pedestrian crossing area where a crossing is not positioned at perfect right angles to the roadway.





Activation





Most modern accessible pedestrian signal systems can be activated in two ways:  Manually, by holding down the tactile arrow for at least three seconds, or  Automatically, by programming the system to cycle with the conventional



visual walk indicators.





Accessible pedestrian signal systems that are programmed to include both methods of activation are required. They can meet immediate needs at any particular pedestrian crossing location, and future needs as conditions change.



In order to determine optimal conditions when programming accessible pedestrian signal systems, organizations should consider site-specific factors, such as:



 the potential for noise complaints from nearby residents  the volume of expected pedestrian traffic, and



 relative usage by pedestrians in that area that need these features.





Audible and vibro-tactile walk indicators



Organizations must make sure that the accessible pedestrian signals have both audible and vibro-tactile walk indicators to signal that it is safe to cross the road.



The audible walk indicator tone is very important for alerting pedestrians when it is safe to cross the road. Organizations will determine the most suitable audible tones to use for their accessible pedestrian signals. For example, “cuckoo sounds” have been used to signal a north-south crossing and the “Canadian melody” has been used for the east-west crossing directions of an intersection.



In situations where there is not enough space on a single corner to install two separate posts, two devices can be installed on a single post. In this case, a verbal announcement is required to indicate when it is safe to cross the road. For example, the signal may announce “Main Street, now crossing.” This replaces the requirement for an audible tone to reduce potential confusion and risks to safety.



The vibro-tactile walk indicator is designed specifically for people who are deafblind who cannot respond to visual or audible cues. Other technical requirements





Where two accessible pedestrian signal devices are located on the same corner of an intersection, they must be placed at a minimum of 3,000 mm apart. The intent of this requirement is to help pedestrians recognize which pedestrian crossing is safe to cross at any time. When the devices are at least 3,000 mm apart, it is easier to hear which direction the audible tone is coming from, due to the distance the sound has to travel.





Rest Areas



Requirements as Stated in the Regulation



Exterior paths of travel, rest areas



80.29 When constructing new or redeveloping existing exterior paths of travel that they intend to maintain, obligated organizations, other than small organizations, shall consult on the design and placement of rest areas along the exterior path of travel and shall do so in the following manner:



1. The Government of Ontario, the Legislative Assembly, designated public



sector organizations and large organizations must consult with the public and persons with disabilities.



2. Municipalities must also consult with their municipal accessibility advisory



committees, where one has been established in accordance with subsection 29 (1) or (2) of the Act.





Intent of these Requirements



The requirement for consultation on rest areas is intended to provide organizations with opportunities to improve access and usability of sidewalks and walkways for all pedestrians, including people with disabilities. People with mobility challenges and reduced stamina will benefit from portions of an exterior path that allow them to move out of the flow of pedestrian traffic to rest before continuing on towards their desired destination.

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2017



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to comply with the requirements.





Implementing the Requirement





Consultation, rest areas



The requirement to consult with the public and people with disabilities on the design and placement of rest areas allows organizations to consider the needs of all pedestrians at the beginning of the design process.



Consultations with the public, including people with disabilities, provide organizations with valuable insight about the diverse needs of the community. Consulting helps designers and decision makers understand any accessibility barriers to develop design solutions that better meet the needs of the local population.



Consultations should take place as early as possible in the planning and design process. Organizations can then weigh all considerations before they make decisions and finalize design plans.



The requirement to consult does not specify a particular process or way to consult. Each organization will determine this based on its own needs. Not outlining a consultation process recognizes that consultations can be conducted in a wide variety of ways. Regulating a standard process may not fit the needs of all organizations. This also allows organizations to use consultation processes they may already have in place and to combine consultations. For example, consultations on rest areas and play spaces can be conducted at the same time, based on an organization’s need to do both.





For more information about accessible consultation processes, organizations



may wish to consult the Ontario Municipal Social Services Association’s Guides



for Accessible Community Engagement . These guides were developed through the Accessibility Directorate of Ontario’s EnAbling Change Program.



Municipalities with an Accessibility Advisory Committee, established in



accordance with subsection 29 (1) or (2) of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, must also consult with the committee.



Exceptions to the Requirements for Exterior Paths of Travel





Requirements as Stated in the Regulation





Exceptions, limitations



80.30 Where an exception is permitted to a requirement for an exterior path of travel, the exception applies solely,



(a) to the particular requirement for which the exception is allowed and not to



any other requirement that applies to the exterior path; and





(b) to the portion of the exterior path for which it is claimed and not to the



exterior path in its entirety.





Exceptions, general



80.31 Exceptions to the requirements that apply to exterior paths of travel are permitted where obligated organizations, other than small organizations, can demonstrate one or more of the following:



1. The requirements, or some of them, would likely affect the cultural



heritage value or interest of a property identified, designated or otherwise protected under the Ontario Heritage Act as being of cultural heritage value or interest.





2. The requirements, or some of them, would affect the preservation of



places set apart as National Historic Sites of Canada by the Minister of the Environment for Canada under the Canada National Parks Act (Canada).



3. The requirements, or some of them, would affect the national historic



interest or significance of historic places marked or commemorated under the Historic Sites and Monuments Act (Canada).



4. The requirements, or some of them, might damage, directly or indirectly,



the cultural heritage or natural heritage on a property included in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation’s World Heritage List of sites under the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.



5. There is a significant risk that the requirements, or some of them, would



adversely affect water, fish, wildlife, plants, invertebrates, species at risk, ecological integrity or natural heritage values, whether the adverse effects are direct or indirect.



6. It is not practicable to comply with the requirements, or some of them,



because existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces or features, such as where increasing the width of the exterior path would narrow the width of the adjacent highway or locating an accessible pedestrian signal pole within 1,500 mm of the curb edge is not feasible because of existing underground utilities.





Intent of these Requirements





There may be cases where it is not possible to build exterior paths of travel exactly to the minimum standards outlined in the regulation. This section permits exceptions based on specific grounds that take into account the historic, cultural, and environmental value, significance and characteristics of the public space.



The intent of these exceptions is to balance the need to provide accessible public spaces that can be used and enjoyed by all with the particular constraints imposed by the location to be developed. The exceptions provide flexibility to make sure that organizations only apply exceptions where required and that they meet the requirements to the greatest extent possible. Accessible Parking





Overview



Ontario’s aging population is driving a need for more accessible parking. Statistics Canada and Government of Ontario data project a 4% increase in the number of accessible parking permit holders by 2025. Minimum province-wide standards will meet the needs of a diverse and growing population of accessible parking permit holders.





This section is divided into the following eight parts:





1. 80.32 Application, off-street parking



2. 80.33 Exceptions



3. 80.34 Types of accessible parking spaces



4. 80.35 Access aisles



5. 80.36 Minimum number and type of accessible parking spaces 6. 80.37 Signage



7. 80.38 Exception



8. 80.39 On-street parking spaces





All sections apply to all organizations in Ontario with the exception of section 80.39. Section 80.39 only applies to the specified designated public sector organizations.





Application, Off-street Parking





Requirement as Stated in the Regulation



80.32 Obligated organizations shall ensure that when constructing new or redeveloping off-street parking facilities that they intend to maintain, the off-street parking facilities meet the requirements set out in this Part. Intent of this Requirement





The intent of accessible parking requirements is to provide minimum province-wide standards that will meet the needs of a diverse and growing population of accessible parking permit holders. These requirements represent minimum standards and do not prevent organizations from exceeding them to meet their own specific needs.

Implementing the Requirement





Application



The accessible parking requirements apply to new parking facilities and the redevelopment of existing parking facilities.



For the purposes of this regulation, re-painting of existing lines to mark parking spaces and other periodic maintenance or restorative activities do not trigger redevelopment requirements. The regulation is not intended to discourage general upkeep of parking facilities but to provide more opportunities to enhance accessibility.





Exceptions





Requirements as Stated in the Regulation





80.33 (1) The requirements in respect of off-street parking facilities do not apply to off-street parking facilities that are used exclusively for one of the following:



1. Parking for buses.



2. Parking for delivery vehicles.



3. Parking for law enforcement vehicles.



4. Parking for medical transportation vehicles, such as ambulances.



5. Parking used as a parking lot for impounded vehicles.



(2) The requirements in respect of off-street parking facilities do not apply to off-street parking facilities if,



(a) the off-street parking facilities are not located on a barrier-free path of



travel, regulated under Ontario Regulation 350/06 (Building Code) made under the Building Code Act, 1992; and



(b) the obligated organization has multiple off-street parking facilities on a



single site that serve a building or facility.





Intent of these Requirements



The intent of the exceptions for accessible off-street parking is to exclude parking facilities that are either:



 not intended for public use, or



 not designed to provide access for people with disabilities, where more



suitable lots exist on the same site

Implementing the Requirements



Exceptions





The requirements for accessible parking spaces in off-street parking facilities apply to parking spaces that are intended for public use. The regulation does not apply to off-street parking facilities that are used exclusively for other purposes, such as lots used exclusively for buses, delivery vehicles, law enforcement vehicles, medical transportation vehicles or impounded vehicles.



If a portion of any off-street parking facility includes parking spaces for the public, these spaces must meet the requirements in this regulation. For example, the requirements for accessible parking will apply to visitor/guest spaces only and not to the other parking spaces in parking facilities for employees or unit owners/tenants in multi-unit residential housing, such as an apartment, townhouse or condominium. Landlords and employers already have a legal duty to accommodate employees or unit owners/tenants with disabilities under the Ontario Human Rights Code.



These requirements represent minimum standards and do not prevent organizations from exceeding them to meet their own specific needs. This could mean installing additional accessible parking spaces for employees or unit An organization may have a number of off-street parking lots on the same site that serve a particular building or series of buildings. In cases like this, the lots connected to a building using a barrier-free path of travel (as defined in Ontario’s Building Code) are the ones that are required to meet the requirements in this standard. If the lots are not connected to a building using a barrier-free path of travel, organizations do not have to provide accessible parking spaces in them based on this standard. This could exclude “overflow” capacity lots typically found on the perimeters of transit stations or large university and hospital complexes.





In such cases, it is likely that there are already barriers present that may restrict mobility, such as steps, a lack of curb ramp transitions and entrances with no power door operators.



The organization is responsible for determining whether a parking lot on their site qualifies for this exception. They must consider any relevant site-specific factors, such as whether an intersecting roadway includes or excludes the parking lot in question from the site boundary.



Please note that, although the standard refers to the 2006 Building Code, the 2012 Building Code has replaced it in its entirety.



Types of Accessible Parking Spaces



Requirement as Stated in the Regulation



80.34 Off-street parking facilities must provide the following two types of parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities:



1. Type A, a wider parking space which has a minimum width of 3,400 mm



and signage that identifies the space as “van accessible”.



2. Type B, a standard parking space which has a minimum width of 2,400



mm.





Intent of this Requirement



The intent of accessible parking requirements is to provide minimum province-wide standards that will meet the needs of a diverse and growing population of accessible parking permit holders. These requirements represent minimum standards and do not prevent organizations from exceeding them to meet their own specific needs.

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 1-49 employees January 1, 2018





Implementing the Requirement





Types of accessible parking spaces



The requirements for accessible parking include two types of accessible parking spaces:



 Type A spaces are for people who use mobility devices and need more space



for the deployment of ramps



 Type B spaces are for people who use canes, crutches or walkers and do not



need this extra space.





Type A or wider accessible parking spaces already exist in some Ontario municipalities, as well as in the United States.





‘Van-accessible’ signage



In addition to signage requirements under the Highway Traffic Act, Type A spaces must be marked with “van accessible” signage. “Van accessible” signage provides information to users on the intended use of the space. It does not prevent other types of vehicles from using them.





Figure 12 - Type A and B parking spaces and van-accessible signage





Location of accessible parking spaces



The regulation does not prescribe where an organization should install the two types of accessible parking spaces in relation to each other. For example, an organization may locate Type B spaces closer to an entrance for users of canes, crutches or walkers, who may have limited stamina compared with users of wheeled mobility devices such as scooters.



Organizations will make these decisions with input from professionals, such as planners and architects. A prescriptive approach is not suitable in this case because it may conflict with plans to achieve the best use of space in any particular lot. Design choices should address the unique set of opportunities and challenges of each parking facility.





Access Aisles





Requirement as Stated in the Regulation



80.35 (1) Access aisles, that is the space between parking spaces that allows persons with disabilities to get in and out of their vehicles, must be provided for all parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities in off-street parking facilities.



(2) Access aisles may be shared by two parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities in an off-street parking facility and must meet the following requirements:



1. They must have a minimum width of 1,500 mm.



2. They must extend the full length of the parking space.



3. They must be marked with high tonal contrast diagonal lines, which



discourages parking in them, where the surface is asphalt, concrete or some other hard surface.





Intent of this Requirement



The intent of accessible parking requirements is to provide minimum province-wide standards that will meet the needs of a diverse and growing population of accessible parking permit holders. These requirements represent minimum standards and do not prevent organizations from exceeding them to meet their own specific needs.

Implementing the Requirement



Access aisles



Accessible parking spaces must include an access aisle that can be shared by two accessible parking spaces. Where there is only one accessible parking space, one access aisle is required.



Access aisles provide users with a space to transfer into and out of their vehicles safely. The total width of a Type A accessible parking space and access aisle is intended to accommodate the combined width of a van, the length of a wheelchair ramp and the wheelchair itself.



On paved ground surfaces, access aisles are required to include high tonal contrast diagonal markings to discourage parking on them. On unpaved ground surfaces, it may be difficult to apply any kind of paint effectively. Other strategies can be used to discourage parking in access aisles on unpaved surfaces, such as:



 marking the access aisle location with additional signage or infrastructure, or  providing a contrasting ground surface treatment





Figure 13 - Accessible parking features



Minimum Number and Type of Accessible Parking Spaces





Requirements as Stated in the Regulation



80.36 (1) Off-street parking facilities must have a minimum number of parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities, in accordance with the following requirements:



1. One parking space for the use of persons with disabilities, which meets



the requirements of a Type A parking space, where there are 12 parking spaces or fewer.



2. Four per cent of the total number of parking spaces for the use of persons



with disabilities, where there are between 13 and 100 parking spaces in accordance with the following ratio, rounding up to the nearest whole number:



i. Where an even number of parking spaces for the use of



persons with disabilities are provided in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph, an equal number of parking spaces that meet the requirements of a Type A parking space





ii. Where an odd number of parking spaces for the use of persons



with disabilities are provided in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph, the number of parking spaces must be divided equally between parking spaces that meet the requirements of a Type A parking space and a Type B parking space, but the additional parking space, the odd-numbered space, may be a Type B parking space.



3. One parking space for the use of persons with disabilities and an



additional three per cent of parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities, where there are between 101 and 200 parking spaces must be parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities, calculated in accordance with ratios set out in subparagraphs 2 i and ii, rounding up to the nearest whole number.



4. Two parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities and an



additional two per cent of parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities, where there are between 201 and 1,000 parking spaces must be parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities in accordance with the ratio in subparagraphs 2 i and ii, rounding up to the nearest whole number.



5. Eleven parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities and an



additional one per cent of parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities, where more than 1,000 parking spaces are provided must be parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities in accordance with the ratio in subparagraphs 2 i and ii, rounding up to the nearest whole number.



(2) If an obligated organization provides more than one off-street parking facility at a site, the obligated organization shall calculate the number and type of parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities according to the number and type of parking spaces required for each off-street parking facility.



(3) In determining the location of parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities that must be provided where there is more than one off-street parking facility at a site, an obligated organization may distribute them among the off-street parking facilities in a manner that provides substantially equivalent or greater accessibility in terms of distance from an accessible entrance or user convenience. (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), the following factors may be considered in determining user convenience:





1. Protection from the weather.



2. Security.



3. Lighting.



4. Comparative maintenance.





Intent of these Requirements



The intent of accessible parking requirements is to provide minimum province-wide standards that will meet the needs of a diverse and growing population of accessible parking permit holders. These requirements represent minimum standards and do not prevent organizations from exceeding them to meet their own specific needs.

Minimum number and type of accessible parking spaces



To meet the growing needs of accessible parking permit holders province-wide, the requirements include minimum numbers of accessible parking spaces different sizes. In some cases, the minimum numbers of accessible parking spaces established in regulation may exceed the current number of accessible parking spaces required under municipal by-laws.





The requirements also include direction on how to calculate minimum numbers of accessible spaces by total lot size. The number of spaces should always be rounded up to the nearest whole number. For example, 6.25 spaces should be rounded up to 7 spaces.

A minimum of four (4) per cent of parking spaces in parking facilities with less than 200 total spaces must be accessible parking spaces. This number is based on Statistics Canada population growth forecasts and projected increases in the numbers of accessible parking permit holders in Ontario. As parking facilities increase in size, a lower proportion of accessible parking spaces are required. This approach is common with municipal accessible parking by-laws and best practice accessibility guidelines.



Calculations should be based on the total number of parking spaces within a single lot, not the total number of parking spaces across a number of lots on the same site. This will help to maximize the total number of accessible parking spaces provided.



The regulation allows for the re-distribution of accessible parking spaces if it would provide equivalent/greater accessibility in terms of distance from accessible entrances or user convenience. For example, preferred lots may be located closer to more commonly used buildings on a university campus or high traffic entrances to a hospital or health-care complex to improve user convenience. Preferred lots may also be equipped with better lighting, other security provisions or areas that provide protection from the weather. Allocating spaces in this way may be more relevant when redeveloping existing parking facilities on a single site rather than when developing a new site.





Signage





Requirement as Stated in the Regulation



80.37 Obligated organizations shall ensure that parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities as required under section 80.36 are distinctly indicated by erecting an accessible permit parking sign in accordance with section 11 of Regulation 581 of the Revised Regulations of Ontario, 1990 (Accessible Parking for Persons with Disabilities) made under the Highway Traffic Act.





Intent of this Requirement



The intent of accessible parking requirements is to provide minimum province-wide standards that will meet the needs of a diverse and growing population. These requirements represent minimum standards and do not prevent organizations from exceeding them to meet their own specific needs.

Implementing the Requirement





Signage



Accessible parking spaces created under this regulation must be identified with signage consistent with the requirements outlined in section 11 of Regulation 581 (Accessible Parking for Persons with Disabilities) under the Highway Traffic Act.



This signage is consistent with what is already required to identify accessible parking spaces in Ontario. To support compliance, these requirements build on well-established signage features for accessible parking spaces that are already regulated.





Exceptions





Requirements as Stated in the Regulation



80.38 (1) An exception to the required minimum number of parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities is permitted where an obligated organization can demonstrate that it is not practicable to comply with the requirement because existing physical or site constraints prevent it from meeting the required ratio, such as where the minimum width for parking spaces for persons with disabilities or access aisles cannot be met because of existing pay and display parking meters, surrounding curb edges, walkways, landscaping or the need to maintain a minimum drive aisle width.



(2) Where an obligated organization claims an exception to the minimum number of parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities, it shall provide as close to as many parking spaces for the use of persons with disabilities that meet the requirements of this Part, as would otherwise be required under subsection 80.36 (1) or (2), as the case may be, that can be accommodated by the existing site and,



(a) where that number is an even number, the number of parking spaces



must be divided equally between parking spaces that meet the requirements



of a Type A parking space and a Type B parking space; and





(b) where that number is an odd number, the number of parking spaces must



be divided equally between parking spaces that meet the requirements of a



Type A parking space and a Type B parking space, but the additional parking



space, the odd-numbered space, may be a Type B parking space.





Intent of these Requirements



The intent of accessible parking requirements is to provide minimum province-wide standards that will meet the needs of a diverse and growing population. These requirements represent minimum standards and do not prevent organizations from exceeding them to meet their own specific needs.



Implementing the Requirements



There may be cases where it is not possible to include the accessible parking requirements exactly to the minimum standards outlined in the regulation. These requirements permit exceptions based on specific characteristics of the public space.



In this case, when meeting the minimum number of accessible parking spaces is not possible, organizations are still required to provide as many accessible parking spaces as possible on the site. It is not acceptable to provide none at all if the minimum numbers cannot be achieved.



Flexibility is provided to make sure that organizations only apply exceptions where required and that they meet the requirements to the greatest extent possible.





On-Street Parking Spaces





Requirement as Stated in the Regulation



80.39 (1) When constructing or redeveloping existing on-street parking spaces, designated public sector organizations shall consult on the need, location and design of accessible on-street parking spaces and shall do so in the following manner:



1. Designated public sector organizations must consult with the public and



persons with disabilities.





2. Municipalities must also consult with their municipal accessibility advisory



committees, where one has been established in accordance with subsection 29 (1) or (2) of the Act.



(2) In this section and despite section 2,



“designated public sector organization” means every municipality and every person or organization described in Schedule 1 to this Regulation, but not persons or organizations listed in Column 1 of Table 1 to Ontario Regulation 146/10 (Public Bodies and Commission Public Bodies — Definitions) made under the Public Service of Ontario Act, 2006.





Intent of this Requirement



The intent of accessible parking requirements is to provide minimum province-wide standards that will meet the needs of a diverse and growing population of accessible parking permit holders. These requirements represent minimum standards and do not prevent organizations from exceeding them to meet their own specific needs.





Table 71 - When do Organizations have to Comply



Affected Organizations Compliance Dates

The Government of Ontario, Legislative Assembly, private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ employees and private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to comply with the requirements.





Within this section of the standard only, “designated public sector organization” means:



 Every district school board as defined in section 1 of the Education Act.  Every college of applied arts and technology established under the Ontario





Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act, 2002.



 Every university in Ontario, including its affiliated and federated colleges, that



receives annual operating grants from the Government of Ontario.



 Every public transportation organization in Ontario, including any municipally



operated transportation services for persons with disabilities, that provides



services for which a fare is charged for transporting the public by vehicles that



are operated,



o by, for or on behalf of the Government of Ontario, a municipality, a



local board of a municipality or a transit or transportation commission or authority,



o under an agreement between the Government of Ontario and a



person, firm, corporation, or transit or transportation commission or authority, or



o under an agreement between a municipality and a person, firm,



corporation or transit or transportation commission or authority.





Implementing the Requirements



On-street accessible parking spaces



The requirements for accessible on-street parking only apply to public sector organizations likely to have responsibility for constructing and redeveloping roadways:



 Municipalities



 District school boards



 Hospitals



 Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology



 Universities that receive annual operating grants from the Government of



Ontario



 Public transportation organizations





The definition of “designated public sector organization” in the rest of the standard is broader, but for this requirement only, the definition has been narrowed to those organizations that may have responsibility for on-street parking.





Consultation requirements



Public sector organizations must consult with the public, including people with disabilities, on the need, location and design of accessible on-street parking spaces when constructing or redeveloping existing on-street parking spaces. The intent of applying a consultation process is to ensure that the public and people with disabilities have a say and can participate in the decision-making process for the location of these accessible spaces.



Consultations should take place as early as possible in the planning and design process. Organizations can then weigh all considerations before they make decisions and finalize design plans.



The requirement to consult does not specify a particular process or way to consult. Each organization will determine this based on its own needs. Not outlining a consultation process recognizes that consultations can be conducted in a wide variety of ways. Regulating a standard process may not fit the needs of all organizations.



This also allows organizations to use consultation processes they may already have in place. It also allows for combined consultations. For example, consultations on on-street accessible parking spaces and rest areas can be conducted at the same time, based on an organization’s need to do both.



For more information about accessible consultation processes, organizations



may wish to consult the Ontario Municipal Social Services Association’s Guides



for Accessible Community Engagement . These guides were developed through the Accessibility Directorate of Ontario’s EnAbling Change Program.



Municipalities with an Accessibility Advisory Committee, established in



accordance with subsection 29 (1) or (2) of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, must also consult with the committee.



Because of the large number of site-specific variables on any given roadway and the need to maintain safety for road-users and pedestrians, specific requirements for accessible on-street parking spaces have not been included (minimum sizes, types and numbers of accessible parking spaces). Consultation topics could include:



 expected accessibility benefits



 any relevant safety concerns



 local traffic patterns





Obtaining Services



Overview





Thinking about accessibility when designing service counters, fixed queuing guides, and waiting areas is an important part of making services and products available for people with disabilities. The requirements in this section address these customer service features.



The requirements in this section apply to all new counters and fixed queuing guides. They also apply to all new and redeveloped waiting areas with fixed seating. Any of these features can be located either indoors or outdoors.





Requirements for obtaining services are divided into three areas:



1. 80.40-80.41 Service Counters



2. 80.42 Fixed Queuing Guides



3. 80.42 Waiting Areas





Service Counters



Requirements as Stated in the Regulation





Application



80.40 (1) Obligated organizations shall meet the requirements set out in this Part in respect of the following:



1. All newly constructed service counters and fixed queuing guides. 2. All newly constructed or redeveloped waiting areas.





(2) For the purposes of this Part, requirements for obtaining services in respect of service counters, fixed queuing guides and waiting areas apply whether the services are obtained in buildings or out-of-doors.





Service counters



80.41 (1) When constructing new service counters, which includes replacing existing service counters, the following requirements must be met: 1. There must be at a minimum one service counter that accommodates a



mobility aid for each type of service provided and the accessible service



counter must be clearly identified with signage, where there are multiple



queuing lines and service counters.



2. Each service counter must accommodate a mobility aid, where a single



queuing line serves a single or multiple counters.





(2) The service counter that accommodates mobility aids must meet the following requirements:



1. The countertop height must be such that it is usable by a person seated in a



mobility aid.



2. There must be sufficient knee clearance for a person seated in a mobility aid,



where a forward approach to the counter is required.



3. The floor space in front of the counter must be sufficiently clear so as to



accommodate a mobility aid.





Intent of these Requirements



These requirements are intended to make sure that counters used to provide service to customers and patrons are made accessible. Organizations have the flexibility to choose an accessible design that works best for their business practices and environment.

Implementing the Requirements





Application



The requirements apply to:



 all new service counters and fixed queuing guides and  all new and redeveloped waiting areas with fixed seating





Service counters



Service counters are intended to be a place where a person receives a service. This can include check-out counters, hospitality/concierge desks or information kiosks.



Organizations must make sure that the service counters they are purchasing and/or constructing will work for customers using mobility devices. This applies to service counters located indoors and outdoors.



The requirements do not include specific measurements to make counters accessible. Instead, the regulation provides organizations with the objectives that should be met, which will tell designers what features are necessary to create an accessible counter. This gives organizations the flexibility to select an accessible design that best meets their business needs.



Designated public sector organizations should review procurement requirements



in section 5 of the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation when determining the type of accessible counter to purchase. In addition, designated public sector organizations and private sector organizations with 50 or more



employees should review the self-service kiosk requirements under section 6 of the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation when determining the type of accessible service counter or kiosk to purchase.





Figure 14 Accessible service counters





The requirements also provide guidance on the number of service counters organizations must provide. For example, a grocery store would have to provide at least one accessible service counter for each of its express, self-service and regular service aisles. This is because each of these counters provides a different type of service. People with disabilities should be able to access each type of service that is provided to all customers.



Where one queuing line serves multiple counters, organizations must design all counters to be accessible. For example, if a retail store uses one queuing line for more than one counter, all counters connected to the queuing line must be useable by customers with mobility devices. Where there are multiple queuing lines and service counters, the accessible option must be clearly identified with signage (an example of which is the International Symbol of Accessibility).



An accessible service counter must be designed so that a person seated in a mobility device can reach any objects intended for customer use, such as a point of sale terminal. It should also be designed so that a person seated in a mobility device can see objects that are intended to be viewed, and to carry out tasks that are intended to be done at the counter, such as writing a signature.



Additionally, if service counters are approached from the front (e.g., in situations where they provide face-to-face interaction with a receptionist), the counter must provide enough clear space so that a person’s knees can be accommodated under the front of the counter when seated in a mobility device. There must also be enough space in front of the counter so a person using a mobility device, such as a wheelchair, can turn their chair and pull up to the counter.





Figure 15 - Knee clearance and clear floor space in front of service counters





Not all services are provided in a face-to-face manner, so not all service counters require clear space underneath to accommodate a person in a mobility device. For example, some services require customers to move parallel to the counter, such as in a grocery store. In cases like this, organizations must make sure that service counters are designed to enable a person using a mobility device to easily place their purchases on the counter surface, see the cash register screen and reach a point-of-sale terminal. Clear space under and in front of the counter may not be necessary to make such service counters accessible. However, clear space in front of the counter that is wide enough to allow a mobility device to pass through may be needed.



Fixed Queuing Guides



Requirements as Stated in the Regulation





80.42 When constructing new fixed queuing guides, the following requirements must be met:



1. The fixed queuing guides must provide sufficient width to allow for the



passage of mobility aids and mobility assistive devices. 2. The fixed queuing guides must have sufficiently clear floor area to permit





mobility aids to turn where queuing lines change direction.



3. The fixed queuing guides must be cane detectable.





Intent of these Requirements



Fixed queuing guides are often used to organize long customer service lines, such as those that serve multiple service counters. Making them accessible for people with various disabilities is part of making the services accessible.



These requirements only apply if the queuing guides are fixed to the floor, both indoors and outdoors. They do not apply to temporary guides, such as moveable posts and ropes.

Private and not-for-profit organizations with 1-49 employees January 1, 2018





Implementing the Requirements





Fixed queuing guides



Fixed queuing guides must be placed far enough apart to allow people using mobility devices to pass through them and turn where the guides change direction. Since some mobility devices, such as wheelchairs or scooters, can be longer than they are wide, more space should be provided for turning when the line changes direction.





Figure 16 - Accessible fixed queuing guides





Fixed queuing guides must be designed to include an element that can be detected by a person using a cane. This refers to long white canes used by people with visual disabilities, rather than canes used to help people walk. Canes used by people with visual disabilities have a specific detection range that allows the user to know what is in front of them and prepare them for any obstructions in their route. Cane-detectable elements, such as posts and railings, should be low to the ground and spaced closely enough together to help a person navigate through the queue.



Organizations have the flexibility to choose a design type that best meets their business needs and the needs of customers with disabilities.





Waiting Areas





Requirement as Stated in the Regulation





80.43 (1) When constructing a new waiting area or redeveloping an existing waiting area, where the seating is fixed to the floor, a minimum of three per cent of the new seating must be accessible, but in no case shall there be fewer than one accessible seating space.



(2) For the purposes of this section, accessible seating is a space in the seating area where an individual using a mobility aid can wait.





Intent of this Requirement



Waiting areas form part of many service areas. Making sure that indoor and outdoor fixed seating areas provide spaces where a customer or patron using a mobility device can wait is essential to providing services for people with disabilities. Combined with the other requirements in this section, this helps make sure that people with disabilities can access goods and services.



These requirements apply to all new and redeveloped waiting areas.

Implementing the Requirement





Waiting areas



Waiting areas with fixed seating must include dedicated spaces for people who use mobility devices, such as wheelchairs. The number of spaces must equal 3% of the total number of seats, with one space being the minimum required.



Dedicated spaces should be in the same area as the rest of the fixed seating to allow customers with and without disabilities to wait together.





Figure 17 - Accessible waiting area features





Maintenance



Overview



Maintenance is an important opportunity to retain an accessible environment that is safe and useable by everyone. Poor maintenance can compromise accessibility and safety.





Maintenance can involve (but is not limited to):



 undertaking specific activities to keep existing public spaces in good working



order, or



 restoring spaces or elements within a space to their original condition





Requirements for Maintenance



Requirement as Stated in the Regulation





Maintenance of accessible elements



80.44 In addition to the accessibility plan requirements set out in section 4, obligated organizations, other than small organizations, shall ensure that their multi-year accessibility plans include the following:



1. Procedures for preventative and emergency maintenance of the accessible



elements in public spaces as required under this Part.



2. Procedures for dealing with temporary disruptions when accessible elements



required under this Part are not in working order.





Intent of this Requirement



Maintenance procedures are important to make sure that people with disabilities can access public spaces. People with disabilities typically have fewer alternative routes when moving through and using public spaces, so procedures for maintenance will help support their continued mobility and independence. Table 75 - When do Organizations have to Comply





Affected Organizations Compliance Dates



Ontario Government and Legislative Assembly January 1, 2015



Designated public sector organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2016



Designated public sector organizations with 1-49 employees January 1, 2016



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 50+ employees January 1, 2017



Private and not-for-profit organizations with 49 or fewer employees are not required to comply with the requirements.



Implementing the Requirement





Maintenance in multi-year accessibility plans



All organizations except small private and not-for-profit organizations are already



required to develop multi-year accessibility plans as part of section 4 requirements under the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation.





Organizations required to have multi-year accessibility plans must document their procedures for:



 preventative and emergency maintenance of the accessible elements in



public spaces required by the standard



 temporary disruptions to accessible public spaces when accessible elements



in public spaces required by the standard are not working





Maintenance procedures for a public space element can depend on:  its purpose



 how often it is used and



 how users would be affected if it is not kept in good working condition For example, a municipality may inspect a sidewalk more frequently than a walkway in a public park because more pedestrians use it more often and it may provide important linkages to the transportation network.





The requirements of the standard only require organizations to document their maintenance procedures for their accessible public spaces (where they exist).



For example, a municipality should document their parks and recreation maintenance schedules for accessible trails or play spaces, especially if those trails or play spaces are not maintained during the winter months.



As another example, an organization should be able to outline their procedures for dealing with the temporary closures of pedestrian crossings due to water main breaks or other unexpected/emergency activities.
