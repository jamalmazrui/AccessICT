WHO GETS EXCLUDED

[]When it comes to people, there’s no such thing as “normal”. For example, the interactions we design with technology depend heavily on what we can see, hear, say, and touch. If we’re designing with ourselves as a baseline, we can overlook people with circumstances different from ours.

WHY IT MATTERS

[]Designing for inclusivity not only opens up our products and experiences to more people with a wider range of abilities. It also reflects how people really are. All humans are growing, changing, and adapting to the world around them every day. We want our designs to reflect that diversity.

So where do we start?

DISABILITY IS DESIGNED

[]The first thing we learned is that defining disability as a health condition is a thing of the past.

Today disability is a multi-faceted term. It covers situational impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions.

All this means that disability is not a personal attribute.

It reflects the complex way people interact with society.

DISABILITY IS UNIVERSAL & DYNAMIC

[]The second thing we learned is that disability is universal and dynamic. This is a shift from thinking about disability as something that only affects a small percentage of the population.

In fact, most of us experience disabilities that are temporary and situational on a daily basis

For example, mobile technolgies make disability highly relevant to a huge number of people.

SOMETIMES DISABILITY IS TEMPORARY

[]Even short-term injury and illness affect the way people interact  with the world around them. Looking into bright light can cause  brief visual impairment. Being sick with a cough makes it hard to speak. Wearing a cast can severely limit a person’s ability to lift an everyday object.

SOMETIMES DISABILITY IS SITUATIONAL

[]As people move through multiple environments, their abilities can also change dramatically. In a loud crowd, they can’t hear well. In a car, they’re visually impaired. A new parent spends much of their day doing tasks one-handed. What’s possible, safe, and appropriate is constantly changing.

DISABILITY INSPIRES BETTER SOLUTIONS

[]The third thing we learned is that seeing disability differently can inspire better designs that benefit more people.

When we understand that disability is a universal and dynamic way of interacting with the world, it can become something else as well: a new source for creativity.

Our impact can also expand, as our inclusive designs reach a greater number of people.

THE TOOLKIT

[]Inclusive: A Microsoft Design Toolkit is made to work within an existing design process. It’s based on three insights: • Disability is designed

• Disability is universal and dynamic • Disability inspires better solutions

We can use this toolkit to evaluate our existing processes, develop new practices, and pilot the practices we want to use.

BENEFITS OF INCLUSIVE DESIGN

[]A solution that’s designed through inclusive practices has four distinct benefits:

1.   Increased access

2.   Reduced friction

3.   Improved emotional cues

4.   Be net-positive for people (value exchange)

OPTIMIZE

[]

Familiarize yourself with the basics of inclusive design.

Review accessibility criteria and create a list of criteria that relate to your design. Interview stakeholders about customer, technical and business criteria.

[][]Research and try existing assistive tools that customers use to interact with technology: Screen readers, motorized wheelchairs, community resources, etc.

[]

Have more questions than answers

Start with HOW before figuring out WHAT you want to make

Set aside any existing solutions for this stage and Frame stage

Be familiar with Inclusive Design terminology and any  accessibility requirements

Conduct research methods. Interview and observe people along this spectrum to understand how they interact with the world. Interview people in the persona network and understand how they interact with people on the persona spectrum.

Draw a persona spectrum. Identify who’s permanently excluded from using existing solutions, based on ability, age, geography, etc.

Start with a universal human theme, without a specific solution in mind.

Build an interaction map of existing solutions and identify points of friction that people encounter.

Identify primary motivations and individual needs that connect the people on the persona spectrum.

[][]Capture and summarize what you’ve learned.

[]

Step outside of what you think you know

Gain insight from studies and people with a wide range of abilities  and experiences

Focus by selecting a human unifier to address

Identify principles or constraints you want to use

Outline behaviors that the technology should imbue

Frame the design challenge with a mismatch in technology in mind

Understand the role of technology with the human interactions Generate ideas related to your interviews and observations. Use benefits of inclusive design to stretch your ideas: Increase access, reduce friction, improve emotional cues, be net-positive for people.

If you need ideas, think about your observations from the persona spectrum and network. Identify specific mismatches between  human-to-human interactions and human-to-technology interactions. Even act out the interactions to help clarify the gaps. What differences were most noticeable?

[][]Use human motivations to look for common themes. Cluster and group similar ideas into cohesive concepts. Select the concepts that best address the primary motivation for everyone on the persona spectrum.

[]

GETTING IT RIGHT

Generate ideas and develop concepts rooted in human insight  and a latent need

Define the human-to-human and human-to-technology mismatch

Put people in the lead

Generate ideas inspired by human interaction

Create experiences with purposeful behaviors

Clearly define at least one inclusive design benefit for a concept

Evaluate if concepts are a benefit to all

Identify what type of role your product plays in someone’s life.  Is there a human metaphor for this role? Use this to research the responsibilities and boundaries of the role.

Identify the stages of relationship that people will have with your product over time. Identify hero tasks and key interactions, big and small.

Build a new interaction map and key scenarios to illustrate the design in context.

Create a low fidelity prototype of your concept. Simulate the persona spectrum and use the prototype.

Conduct usability tests of prototype with people along the persona spectrum.

[][]Check accessibility criteria and refine.

[]

GETTING IT RIGHT

Refine the balance of creating “for one” and universal

Define a human analogy for your concept

Create lo-fi prototypes

Document what parts of your accessibility checklist are addressed

Map the interaction journey with considerations for  the stages of relationship, context

Evaluate across the full persona spectrum and iterate with different temporary and situational limitations

Build a high fidelity prototype of your concept. Simulate the persona spectrum and use the prototype.

Conduct usability tests of your prototype with people along the persona spectrum.

Use benefits of Inclusive Design to assess and measure improvements:

increase access, reduce friction, improve emotional cues, be  net-positive for people.

[][]Reflect on why your design matters and build a story for how it benefits everyone along your persona spectrum.

[]

GETTING IT RIGHT

Clearly articulate the why for your solution

Evaluate using the benefits of inclusive design as a checklist

Be brave and go back to iterate, if needed
