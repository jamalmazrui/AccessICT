<p>Accessibility is frequently the last thing course and website
developers want to think about when creating an online content. There is
extra time involved up front, but it can help prevent problems down the
line. I think most of us in higher education care about all students and
want to help them to our best ability. There are also laws protecting
the rights of individuals with disabilities to have access to programs
and services that institutions of higher education offer. <a
href="https://www.dol.gov/oasam/regs/statutes/sec504.htm"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 504 of The Rehabilitation Act of
1973</a> says that public institutions receiving federal funds, this
includes student financial aid, need to ensure that people with
disabilities can participate in programs &amp; activities and have the
same benefits that people without disabilities have. It requires
academic adjustments and accommodation to ensure full participation. <a
href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-508-home-page" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">Section 508</a> is an amendment that requires electronic
information and technology, such as websites and online courses be
accessible. <a href="http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm#12102"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">The American with Disabilities Act of
1990</a> expands the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to private as well as
public institutions of higher education. The newest is <a
href="http://www.fcc.gov/guides/21st-century-communications-and-video-accessibility-act-2010"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">The 21st Century Communications and Video
Accessibility Act of 2010</a>. It requires modern communications to be
accessible to people with disabilities. This includes VOIP services,
electronic messaging, video conferencing, video communications and
mobile browsers.</p>
<p>One only needs to search Google to find names of institutions of
higher education that have been sued for not having accessible online
content and services. When we design accessibly from the start, we can
attract a wider audience to our product or service, and protect our
institutions from losing time and money in a future lawsuit.</p>
<p>I’m writing this book to help faculty and online site developers
learn about best practices for designing and developing online content.
Some of the instructions for document accessibility are based off of
Office 2016, rather than Office 365 in browser apps. The menus should be
similar.<br />
This book is currently under development. So, please check regularly to
see updates.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in making your content accessible and for
caring about others!</p>

<p>This section of the book will explain what accessibility and
universal design are. It will give reasons why accessibility is
important, and the laws and standards supporting accessibility. It will
give a definition of disability and explain the ways in which people
with different abilities navigate an online environment, and the
barriers they encounter.</p>

<p>Accessibility is the degree to which a product, service or
environment is available to all users, including those with disabilities
or special needs. It’s about our ability to participate in and belong to
the world around us. The Office of Civil Rights, in a resolution
agreement with South Carolina Technical College, said, “Accessible means
a person with a disability is afforded the opportunity to acquire the
same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same
services as a person without a disability in an equally effective and
equally integrated manner, with substantially equivalent ease of
use.”</p>
<p>A similar concept is Universal Design. Universal Design is the
proactive design of products and environments to be usable by all
people, to the greatest extent, without the need for adaptation or
specialized design. A curb cut is an example of something that is
universally designed. It helps people in wheel chairs and using walkers
navigate their environment, but it also benefits people pushing
strollers and carts, pulling luggage, people on bicycles, and people on
roller skates.</p>

Curb cuts are an example of universal design. They benefit everyone, not
just people who use wheelchairs.
</div>
</div>
<p>While it may not be possible to make everything accessible to all
people due to variation in user needs and abilities, we can follow
standards to make our online content accessible to the broadest range of
people. These standards are referred to as the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines.</p>

<p>According to <a
href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12102" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">U.S. Code Title 42, Chapter  126, § 12102</a>, a
disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits
one or more major life activities of an individual. Major life
activities include, but are not limited to, caring for oneself,
performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking,
standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading,
concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.</p>
<p>A major life activity also includes the operation of a major bodily
function, including but not limited to, functions of the immune system,
normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain,
respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions.</p>
<p>In reality, we are all aging into disability.</p>
<p>Visual disabilities include blindness, low vision, tunnel vision, and
central field loss in which there is loss of vision in the central
portion of the eye. Auditory disabilities include deafness, hearing
impairment and speech disabilities. Diseases such as Parkinson’s and
arthritis can affect mobility, use of hands, eyes, coordination and fine
motor control. Cognitive disabilities are highly variable and can
include learning disability, dyslexia, and conditions that affect memory
and attention.</p>
<p>Sometimes when people think of a person with a disability, they think
of a condition that has existed since birth. Not all disabilities are
present at birth and not all are permanent. A person may lose the use of
his or her dominant arm or hand for a few months due to a fractured or
broken bone, for example. A disability can happen to anyone of us and
anytime.</p>
<p>Online we will be concerned with the accessibility of our documents,
such as Word, PDF and Power Point files, the code behind what we
present, the websites we ask our users to interact with, and the
activities we ask them to perform.</p>

<p>When I was in Physical Therapy school at OSU, I had an instructor
tell us that we have to be careful not to refer to the patient by their
condition. That is, you wouldn’t want to say, “I have my hip replacement
coming at 1 o’clock.” Instead you might tell your supervisor or fellow
physical therapist, “I have Mrs. M coming at 1 o’clock for her hip
replacement therapy.” Likewise, when we have a student with a
disability, such as blindness, we would refer to him or her as a person
who is blind. For example, if I were to approach our Office of
Disability Services, I would say, “I need help with making
accommodations for a student in my course who is blind,” instead of “I
need help with making accommodations for a blind student in my
course.”</p>

<p>As teachers and members of an academic institution, don’t we want
everyone to have the opportunity to learn, share, be creative and
succeed in life? Aren’t we here to enrich people’s lives and provide
information to everyone? Imagine if we can open doors to information,
not shut them to a certain segment of the population. We want to enable
independence for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>To quote David Berman, a web accessibility expert, “what if we had
denied an education to these people?”</p>

<p>If you’ve ever experienced being excluded from an activity you wanted
to participate in, you’ll understand, that designing inclusive
experiences is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>It’s smart for business, helping users find our information and
broadening our customer base.</p>
<p>Moreover, it’s the law.</p>

<p>There are four existing laws you should be aware of when designing

title="Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973"><strong>Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</strong></a>, says that colleges
or universities that receive federal funds need to ensure that people
with disabilities can participate in programs &amp; activities and have
the same benefits that people without disabilities have. Subpart E
requires an institution to be prepared to make reasonable academic
adjustments and accommodations to allow students with disabilities full
participation in the same programs and activities available to students
without disabilities.</li>
<li><a

title="Section 508 of The Rehabilitation Act of 1973"><strong>Section
508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</strong></a> is an amendment that
deals with electronic information and technology. If you are a state
that receives federal funds under the Technology Related Assistance for
Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988, you need to ensure that
people with disabilities have access to and can use information and
services available to non-disabled members of the public. This includes
information stored on web sites and in online courses. Ohio receives
funds from the Technology Related Assistance for Individuals with
Disabilities Act of 1988. With a recent rewriting of Section 508, on
January 18, 2017, the rule now refers to Electronic and Information
Technology (EIT) as Information and Communication Technology (ICT).</li>

Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to private as well as public institutions of
higher education. It requires schools to provide access to the same
programs that non-disabled people participate in, in an integrated
setting where possible. It requires auxiliary aids and services when
necessary to ensure effective communication.</li>

<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>Legislation regarding accessibility at higher educational
institutions recently changed. In the United States, we follow Section
508 guidelines for designing websites and online content. The U.S.
Access Board writes Section 508 rules for organizations receiving
federal funds to follow, as part of the 1998 Amendment to the
Rehabilitation Act. They are enforced by the Dept. of Education’s Office
of Civil Rights and the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Section 508 rules were previously published on December 21, 2000, and
implemented in the summer of 2001. However, Section 508 recently
underwent a refresh, and the new standards were written into the Federal
Registrar on January 18, 2017. The new standards align with the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) Level AA. At the time of
writing, WCAG went through an update to version 2.1 on June 5th, 2018.
We’ll have to keep checking to see when Section 508 points to the newer
standards. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are written by the
Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) at the World Wide Web Consortium.
This is an international group and these are international standards
that have been adopted by designers in other countries, such as in
Europe and Canada, already. There are three levels to each WCAG 2.0
guideline – Level A is what you must do, level AA is what you should do,
and level AAA produces the best accessibility for the most people. The
WCAG 2.0 guidelines are broader in scope than the previous Section 508
standards. The new focus will be on functionality rather than device or
technology specific standards. Technology has changed a great deal since
Section 508 standards were last written in 2000. People are no longer
relying on desktops primarily to access information. They are using
smart phones and other mobile devices with voice text and video
communications. By harmonizing U.S. standards with what other countries
are following, we will create a larger market for our information and
communication technology. Along with the Section 508 rules rewrite,
section 255 of the Communications Act of 1934 is also being updated.
Section 255 applies to the manufacturers and authors of our
communication and information technology devices and software. The
information and communication technology the new standards refer to are:
VOIP products, computers, software, office machines, information kiosks,
transaction machines, websites, and electronic documents.</p>
<p>The image below shows the degree of accessibility each level of WCAG
2.0 covers compared to the previous Section 508 standards, which most
closely resembles WCAG 2.0 Level A.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/the_Standards.gif" class="clear" width="306"
height="182"
alt="Three rectangles superimposed over one another. The smallest has &quot;A - Most closely resembles Section 508,&quot; the second largest has &quot;AA,&quot; and the largest rectangle has &quot;AAA.&quot;" /></p>
<p>Another change to Section 508 is delineation of covered “content.”
All public facing content as well as eight categories of non-public
facing content will have to be accessible.</p>

<p>Why look at the older, previous set of standards? Some businesses or
vendors may not have paid for an updated Voluntary Product Accessibility
Template yet. So, you may see some reference to the older standards
until they have the accessibility of the product evaluated again. It’s
also interesting to see similarities between the old Section 508 EIT
standards and the WCAG 2.0 Level AA standards.</p>

identification and navigation.</li>
<li>(j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker
with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz.</li>
<li>(k) A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality,
shall be provided to make a web site comply with the provisions of this
part, when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The
content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page
changes.</li>
<li>(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to
create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall
be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive
technology.</li>
<li>(m) When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other
application be present on the client system to interpret page content,
the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with
§1194.21(a) through (l).</li>
<li>(n) When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the
form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the
information, field elements, and functionality required for completion
and submission of the form, including all directions and cues.</li>
<li>(o) A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive
navigation links.</li>
<li>(p) When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and

<p>Screen reader software reads online content to the end user. The
primary users are people who are blind and those with low vision. It’s
also used by people with other disabilities and multiple disabilities to
a lesser extent. Some users have reading difficulties which may be due
to being a non-native speaker, or dyslexia, for example. There are also
used by people who are deaf and blind to convert text into Braille
characters on refreshable Braille devices. The photograph below shows a
refreshable Braille device being used.</p>

<p>There are a number of freely available screen readers, such as
<em>Voiceover</em> built into Mac operating systems,
<em>Window-Eyes</em> built into Windows OS, <em>NVDA</em> for Windows,
and a 40 minute, limited version of <em>JAWS</em>. JAWS has been around
a long time and is still predominantly used today, but is quickly being
displaced by <em>ZoomText</em>, <em>Window-Eyes</em> and <em>NVDA</em>
(See the <a href="http://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey6"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
title="WebAIM survey on screen reader usage">WebAIM survey on screen
reader usage</a>). Designers and developers use screen readers as a
readily accessible way to test their content, though the best tests are
with people who rely on this technology on a regular basis. You can <a
href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/downloads/jaws" target="_blank"
rel="noopener" title="Download JAWS for Windows">download JAWS for
Windows</a> at http://www.freedomscientific.com/downloads/jaws.  NVDA
doesn’t have a 40 minute time limit per use, which is fantastic!  You
can <a href="http://www.nvaccess.org/download" target="_blank"
rel="noopener" title="Download NVDA screen reader">download NVDA</a> at
http://www.nvaccess.org/download/.</p>
<p>People use screen reader software to read content in PDFs, Word
files, email applications, and web pages, for example. Screen readers
not only read the text on the page, they announce important elements to
the user to describe what is on the page, such as the number of headings
on the page, number of links, and number of form fields. A screen reader
user can have the software say everything from the top left of the page,
or they can use keyboard navigation to jump to certain elements. They
can use the tab key to move between links and form fields on a page, and
use the up and down arrow keys to move between lines of text or to the
next item. There are also custom keys to jump to specific types of
content the user is interested in. In JAWS, the “<strong>H</strong>” key
will move between headings. The “<strong>F</strong>” key will move from
form to form. “<strong>T</strong>” will move to the next table,
“<strong>B</strong>” to the next button. There are also keyboard
combinations that can help bring up lists of important elements on a web
page, in order to help users navigate faster. In JAWS, pressing
the <strong>Insert</strong> key followed by <strong>F6</strong> will
bring up a list of headings on the page with heading level,
<strong>Insert</strong> + <strong>F7</strong> will bring up a list of
links on a page, <strong>Insert</strong> + <strong>F9</strong> will
bring up a list of form elements.</p>
<p>Screen reader users can run into barriers when content isn’t marked
up properly. This markup tells the user what an object on the screen is
and what it does. A big one is missing alternative text. Alt text is
used to convey the purpose or information contained in or by an image.
If an image is used as a link or a button, alt text will tell a blind
person where the link will lead to, or in the case of a button, what
will happen if it is activated. When headings are coded as headings on a
web page, or styled as headings in Word, these provide landmarks to help
a screen reader user navigate to what they would like to hear
faster.</p>

<p>Voice recognition software is used primarily for hands-free operation
of a computer by people with mobility impairments. It’s used for
dictation to write text in place of typing. It’s also used for
commanding the computer to perform tasks that would be done with a mouse
or keyboard. These tasks include opening and closing applications,
switching from one application to another, using the menus and options
available within an application, clicking on buttons, links and other
interactive elements on a web page, drag and drop, as well as other
tasks. Dragon Naturally Speaking is the most popular voice recognition
software, but there are others. Windows operating system has a built in
tool called <em>Speech Recognition</em>. Mac OS X has its <em>Enhanced
Dictation</em> tool and iOS devices have <em>Siri</em>.</p>
<p>Command mode works on the premise of see it and say it. A voice
recognition user gives commands to their computer based on what they see
on the screen. Later, we’ll talk about alternative text that can be
placed on images or buttons. Alternative text is typically used by
screen readers to help  people who are blind know what information is
being conveyed by an image, but it’s also used by people using voice
recognition software. Alternative text or “alt text” that is placed on a
button, for example, should match text that is on a button, so that the
command the user will give will match.</p>
<p>Dragon Naturally Speaking has features that will help with command
and control when elements on a web page aren’t coded as links or
buttons, or elements don’t have the proper alternative text attribute
set on them. One is the “mouse grid” tool which provides a series of
numbered grids on the page that progressively shrink and re-center
themselves over the previously spoken number’s area. Another is telling
the mouse to move up, down, left and right. There’s a <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOSObinq7a4" target="_blank"

the mouse</a> at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOSObinq7a4.</p>

<p>In the previous example, we saw how painfully slow it can be for
voice recognition software users to navigate an improperly coded
website. The technology, though, can allow for greater efficiency in
navigating when alt text is set, for example. Compare by watching the

<p>People with low vision include those with part of their field of view
blocked, or blurred. Glaucoma causes tunnel vision, reducing the field
of view around the outer edges. Macular degeneration causes blockage of
vision in the central part of the eye. Cataracts will cause blurred
vision. People with low vision frequently use magnification programs to
view the computer screen. Operating systems have built-in magnifiers and
there are third party ones that are more feature rich. Screen magnifiers
built into operating systems are <em>Windows Magnifier</em> on the
Windows platform and <em>Zoom</em> on MacOS and iOS.  More feature rich
magnification programs are <a href="https://youtu.be/ojtiVj78QPw"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
title="Link takes you to Youtube video introduction to ZoomText and Screen Magnifiers"><em>ZoomText</em></a> and
<em>MAGic</em>. Screen magnifiers typically provide features like
variable magnification, color contrast adjustment, text to speech, and
tools for helping with cursor tracking and focus.</p>
<p>Some users will magnify what they see in a browser by pressing
the <strong>CTRL</strong> key followed by the <strong>+</strong> key on
their keyboard. They zoom back out by pressing <strong>CTRL –</strong> .
Users can also increase the font size within their browser settings to
be greater than the default 16 pixels.</p>
<p>Seeing a small portion of the screen at once can cause problems with
orientation and navigation. Split screen modes are possible in which one
side presents the enlarged version of the content and the other side
presents the non-magnified view of the page, but this uses up screen
real estate. Other screen magnifiers will use a picture in picture mode.
This presents as an enlarged outlined area over the top of the page
wherever the mouse is pointing on the page. It’s best to avoid using
multi-column layouts in order to help users with low vision view your
content.</p>
<h2>Views Using Screen Magnifiers</h2>

<h2>Difficulties with using Screen Magnifiers</h2>
<p>When a student uses a screen magnifier they might have trouble with
scanning the screen to find specific content they are looking for. This
might make performing certain tasks take more time than they would for
other students. If images that the student is viewing were produced with
a low resolution (usually below 300dpi), the greater the magnification
the more difficult it will be to read the content in the image. If color
is used for conveying information, an inverted contrast or color
filtering might make it impossible to identify the color that the
student needs to see. Students using this technology commonly have
difficulties perceiving color as well.</p>
<h2>Font Style, Color, and Size Adjustment</h2>
<div style="clear: both; width: 90%;">

class="clear" width="479" height="299"
alt="A web page displaying with a black background instead of white. Text links are a dark blue or visited links are dark purple, which are difficult for someone with normal color vision to see against the black background." /></p>
<div style="clear: both;">
<h2>Difficulties with Font and Color Adjustment</h2>
<p>Using <em>images of text</em> instead of text will make it so that
the person cannot adjust the preferences they need to be able to see the
content. This happens commonly when people use PDF documents without
proper accessibility elements, images of foreign language or images of
mathematical text. People can have difficulty making these adjustments
if documents were prepared with spacing instead of using proper table
structure or multi-column layout in Word. People also have difficulty
making adjustments with a screen magnification program when text with
fixed positions on the page are used, such as when text is put in text
boxes with fixed sizes to create a callout. When enlarged, the text can
overlap or be displayed in an order that no longer makes sense. If color
is used as the only method for providing information, when the color is
changed it might nullify the message.</p>
<h2>Printed Content</h2>
<p>Students with low vision will also sometimes print online documents
to make adjustments like those seen in the images above. Students who do
this typically are looking to make the text larger, or make the colors
less busy, so that they can print an easier to read document. Students
with low vision also use handheld magnifiers or electronic magnifiers
which can apply tinting or invert the colors of the printed document. If
the student is not able to customize the printed document, it may make
the document harder or even impossible to read with the magnifier.
Elements that make this harder to accomplish are text embedded into
images, customizing colors inside of individual PowerPoint slides
instead of within a PowerPoint theme slide, and using floating textboxes
in Word.</p>

<p>Assistive devices have enabled people with mobility impairments to
not only use a computer and access information on it, but to create
websites, videos, and documents for others, provide independence and a
path to employment.</p>
<p>Hardware assistive devices primarily emulate keyboard and mouse
input. However, there are switch devices in place today that work with
Switch Control in iOS 7 and higher, that allow users to operate Apple
mobile devices, such as an iPad. Watch the video below that shows how a
boy with cerebral palsy uses a switch and an iPad in switch mode and
point mode to navigate the web, interact with applications, focus the
camera. Switch mode is used when there are recognizable buttons. But, he
engages Point Mode, often, when there aren’t recognizable buttons or it
allows him to navigate faster. Below is an example of a non-captioned
Youtube video captioned with an Amara.org account. It contains both a
“CC” icon to show closed captioning, as well as a page icon to display
an interactive transcript. Check out the interactive transcript, which
highlights lines of text as they are spoken by the narrators. You’ll
learn more about Amara in the module on transcribing and adding closed
captions to your multimedia files. The video, called <a

<h2>Setting Document Language/s</h2>
<p>It’s important to indicate the language or languages within your
document for a screen reader to read it properly. During setup of
Microsoft Office, you likely specified your default language as English.
If you would need to change the default document language or add
additional languages, within a multi-language document, you can do this
under the <strong>File</strong> menu.</p>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>File</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Options</strong> from the list on the left
navigation. It’s at the bottom of this list within Word 2016.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Word Options</strong> dialogue box that pops up,
select <strong>Language</strong> from the navigation list on the
left.</li>
<li>From the drop down menu below your <strong>Editing
Languages</strong> box, where it says, “<strong>Add additional editing
languages</strong>,” click on the drop down arrow to expand the menu and
select English (United States) or another language.<br />

<h2>Checking with a Screen Reader</h2>
<p>The default settings in JAWS 17 automatically detects when the
language changes within a Word document and will start reading in the
new language. NVDA will do this when its voice synthesizer is set to its
default eSpeak NG. To make sure NVDA’s synthesizer is set to eSpeak NG,
find the NVDA icon in the system tray (Windows). It looks like an N with
a curved ascending arm as seen below.</p>

class=".responsive-image-left-50" width="250" height="165"
alt="NVDA icon showing in Windows System Tray" /></p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the <strong>NVDA</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select <strong>Preferences</strong> to expand its preferences
menu</li>
<li>Within the preferences menu, select
<strong>Synthesizer</strong></li>
<li>Select the first option for synthesizer to set it to <strong>eSpeak
NG</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">. The Microsoft Speech API
version 5 sounds more pleasant, but won’t automatically switch the
languages its reading when the language changes.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll attach a multi-language Word document below in case you would
like to practice with it.</p>

<h2>Setting Language on Small Amounts of Text in Multi-Language
Document</h2>
<p>If you find that a screen reader automatically switches to a foreign
language when it should not have, or if you have small amounts of text
that are a different language from the main language of the document,
you can set the language on this text specifically by:</p>
<ol>
<li>select the line of text that it isn’t reading properly, or the
word/s that are in a different language</li>
<li>click the <strong>Review</strong> tab,</li>
<li>click on <strong>Language</strong> in the ribbon at the top</li>
<li>Select “<strong>Set Proofing Language</strong>.”</li>
<li>From the Language dialogue box the opens up, you’ll see the
incorrect language highlighted. Scroll to find the language you want,
such as <strong>Chinese (PRC)</strong>, select it and click
<strong>OK</strong> at the bottom. The screen reader should now read
back the line in that language. This case really did happen with the
practice syllabus you’ll work on for your assignment in this chapter.
For some reason, when JAWS and NVDA reached the line starting with
“<em>Prerequisites</em>,” it started reading in German. That could throw
your audience off track!</li>
</ol>

to another language in Word 2016:</p>

</div>
<h2>Setting a Word Document Title</h2>
<p>Setting a Word document title can be useful if the document will be
converted to HTML and viewed by a screen reader user in a browser. In
the .htm (HTML) format, the title will show within the title element,
located between the opening and closing head element. The structure
would look like &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;TITLE&gt;Your unique title
here&lt;/TITLE&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt; with some other elements listed between
the head elements also. A title set in Word will go with a Word document
converted to PDF also. You can set a title on a Word document by:</p>
<ol>
<li>With the document open, click on the <strong>File</strong> menu</li>
<li>Select <strong>Info</strong> if it is not selected</li>
<li>Under the <strong>Properties</strong> column on the right, find
<strong>Title</strong> and click the <strong>Add a Title</strong> text
to the right of it</li>
<li>Type a unique, concise title that explains what the document is
about</li>
<li><strong>Save</strong> the document</li>
</ol>
<h2>Create a Unique Concise File Name</h2>
<p>Both in Word and Acrobat, a screen reader reads the file name first
of the document that is open. Because of this, it’s a good idea to make
your file name a unique, concise description of what the file is about
also. It’s okay if it matches your title or heading level 1.</p>

<p>Contrast is the difference in luminosity or tonal values between the
foreground and background. In other words, the difference between the
value of the foreground color, which is usually your font color, and the
background color of the screen, Contrast is a property that helps us see
and distinguish figure from ground.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways">
<div class="textbox__header">
<p>Key Takeaway</p>
</div>
<div class="textbox__content">
<p>WCAG 2.0 guidelines require a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 between the
foreground color (text color) and background color to meet level AA, for
standard font size, e.g. 12 pt font. Large print sizes, or large scale
text can have a contrast ratio of 3:1. A large print size is considered
14 pt (approximately 18.66 px) bold, or 18 pt (24 px) or larger
non-bold text. The contrast ratio requirements are the same for WCAG 2.1
for level AA. WCAG 2.1 has an additional standard (1.4.11) for user
interface components and graphical objects that requires a contrast
ratio of 3:1 against adjacent colors to pass level AA.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are lots of color contrast analysers available within various
programs and as free downloads on the web. A stand alone application
that will tell you whether your foreground and background color choices
have enough contrast to meet WCAG 2.0 level AA or level AAA standards is
called <a
href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
title="This link takes you to a download page for Colour Contrast Analyser application">Colour
Contrast Analyser</a>. It is a free download from The Paciello Group’s
website. This is a nifty tool and I recommend downloading and installing
it! It contains an eye dropper for sampling colors on your computer
screen, much like that of Adobe Photoshop’s color picker. You can keep
the application on your desktop or set a short cut for it within your
Start menu in Windows to have easy access to launching it. Colour
Contrast Analyser will tell you the contrast ratio of your selected
foreground and background colors, let you know if it passes WCAG 2.0
level AA and level AAA, and toggles into a mode that lets you see how
people with different color blindnesses see your text against
background. If your color choices don’t pass, there are sliders to
adjust the red, green, and blue values to change the color to something
that will pass, and suggested variations on the color. The
hexidecimal color codes from the passing colors can be copied and used
in Word or Blackboard Learn’s content editor. Hexidecimal code is
typically how colors are designated in HTML. Hexidecimal code for color
takes the format of an octothorpe (pound symbol) followed by six letters
or numbers, two characters for red, two for green and two for blue.
Hexidecimal code for white is #ffffff, and for black is #000000.</p>
<p>The older, Classic version of Colour Contrast Analyser (2.5.x) also
has a built in screen, web page, and file viewer that will allow you to
see what the colors look like as a whole for people with various types
of color blindness. This later simulation is available in the Windows
version only. These simulated web pages for protanopia, deuteranopia and
tritanopia can be saved as jpg (jpeg) files if you need to reference
them later or share them with other designers and decision makers.</p>

<p>Word has a built in accessibility checker that will sometimes catch
contrast issues and sometimes not. The use of the Colour Contrast
Analyser application can help you check, when you may have doubt about
your choices.</p>
<p>Other tools for checking to see if you have adequate color contrast
are <a href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"

Contrast Ratio Analyser</a>. Both of these require you to know the
hexidecimal color values, before arriving at the page. There is no eye
dropper tool to sample the colors from a page open on your screen. You
enter the known color values into their form and submit it to get
results on pass or fail for WCAG 2.0 Level AA or AAA. WebAIM directs
designers to install <a href="http://www.colorzilla.com/firefox"

<p>You should avoid the use of color alone to convey meaning in order to
help user’s with colorblindness. Color blindness comes in various
states. Protanopia results from insensitivity to red light, which causes
confusion in discerning greens, reds or yellows. Deuteranopia results
from insensitivity to green light, which causes confusion in discerning
green, red and yellows. It is the most common form of color-blindness,
often referred to as red-green colorblindness. Tritanopia results from
an insensitivity to blue light, which causes confusion in discerning
greens and blues. Achromatopsia or Monochromacy is rare, but results in
a person not being able to see color at all, only black, white and
shades of gray. Wordwide, approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women have
a color deficiency. There are a greater number of white (Caucasian)
people with color blindness, such as in Scandanavia where 10-11% of men
have color blindness.</p>
<h2>Avoid Color Coding Text, Only, To Indicate Importance:</h2>

state in your course schedule that the dates listed in red are quiz
dates, and then only color code the text to represent those days.</p>

<p>You could fix this problem by saying the dates listed in red with the
asterisk beside them are days you will have a quiz over the previous
topics. The asterisk has come to be known as a designator of required
fields on internet forms, for screen reader users. Thus, it could be
used here to designate important dates in a schedule.</p>

<h2 style="clear: both;">Inherent Color Conveying Meaning, What Do You
Do?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you need to present information that inherently has color
coding that represents meaning. The following example is from <a
href="http://www.vischeck.com/daltonize" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">Vischeck’s website</a>. On the left, the
photomicrograph shows how fluorescent staining of a cell renders a blue,
green and red image where the colors represent different structures
within a cell. The image to the right of it, shows how someone with
red/green color blindness (deuteranopia) would see the colors. The
greens and reds show as yellows and the boundary between them is
lost. </p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/RedGreenColorBlindExample_600px.jpg"
class="clear" width="600" height="454"
alt="A cell stained with flourescent dyes, producing green and red areas. On the right is a simulation of the same cell seen by someone with red-green color blindness. The green are red areas appear yellow in the simulation." /></p>
<p>Vischeck’s website used to have a way to upload an image like this to
run through their Daltonizing algorithm. The algorithm increases
contrast between the green and red areas, and shifts the hue of the red
toward a blue or grayish color. This helps differentiate the structures
of the cell. There is an example of the same image of the cell run
through their Daltonizing algorithm on the right, below. Unfortunately,
no one can load an image to be run through the Daltonizing algorithm at
this time. There are other resources you can recommend to colorblind
students that may help them see difference between colors.<br />

<h2>Resources to Help Daltonize Images for Colorblind Audience:</h2>
<p>Google Chrome browser has an extension which will simulate what an
image or page looks like to a person with various types of
colorblindness and has a Daltonization algorithm to convert a page or
image for people with colorblindness to see differences between colors.

<p>Designers who use Photoshop CC 2017 also have access to colorblind

by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clicking on the <strong>View</strong> menu</li>

<p>The following movie demonstrates the use of Photoshop’s colorblind
simulators when looking at a form. The form, unfortunately, was designed
so that the color red alone indicated required fields! See what someone
with protanopia or deuteranopia would see when viewing this form. They
are left guessing which fields are required. Best practice would be to
place an asterisk before each required form field label and let the user
know that the asterisk designates a required field.</p>

<p>Your choice of font family, style, weight, size, color, and
line-height can all affect its legibility and readability on screen.
Legibility is the ability of someone to discern what is written. Capta
text is often barely legible, as an example. Avoid the use of Script
text, for legibility reasons. Readability is how easy or difficult it is
to read the content. Readability is affected by not only your style of
writing, but your choice of and formatting of text on the page. In Word,
we’ll be formatting text with Word Styles primarily. But, we’ll talk
about font properties that will help your readers, both with and without
documented disabilities.</p>
<p>When selecting a font family for screen viewed text, you’ll want to
select families and weights that have a substantial stroke thickness and
medium sized x-heights. The x-height is the height of the lower case
letter x within the font family. All the lower case letters within the
font typically have the same height as the x height.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/laymans-layout-type-anatomy-small.jpg"
class="clear" width="714" height="201"
alt="Illustration of the different terms used to describe a font face. Of note is the x-height which is the height of the lowercase x of the font face." /></p>
<p>Sans-serif fonts, such as Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, Tahoma,
Trebuchet MS, or Myriad Web Pro are good choices for body text. Though
you want to pick fonts with substantial stroke thickness, it may be a
good idea to avoid the use of a font that is designed primarily as bold,
such as Arial Rounded MT Bold, because you are left with few options for
formatting for importance. If you apply a Strong Style (bolding), to an
already bold font, it makes the font so thick, it becomes difficult to
read on screen.</p>
<p>If you are using a serif font family, Times New Roman, and Georgia
are good selections. In general, serif font families work well for body
type that is printed, and sans-serif families work well as body type
presented on screen. When it comes to styling text, it’s a good idea to
minimally use Italics (the emphasis style) because slanting the letters
can effect their readability. Bolding (the strong style), also, should
be used sparingly and be reserved for text you want to strongly
emphasize. Selecting 12 point text or higher will help readers with
vision difficulties. When a browser’s default font size is set to 16 px,
12 pt is approximately equal to that height. Line-height can make large
blocks of body text or long lists easier to read. These paragraphs, on
this page, have a line-height of 170% set within the HTML. In Word, you
can select a multiple from the paragraph formatting options, such as
1.5, that will be one and a half the the line height of your font. Keep
your Word documents in Word format, rather than converting them to PDFs
with security restrictions, to help users who may need to download and
manipulate font sizes and colors to help them perceive and understand
the information presented. From the previous section, we saw how
assistive technology applications like MAGic can manipulate a document
to make it more accessible to those with low vision.</p>
<p>There are other properties of a document’s formatting that effect
readability. It helps to group related content together by using
headings above associated paragraphs. There should be separation of
groups of related content by white space. Adding white space around
images can help also. Line lengths should be reasonable. The avoidance
of unnecessary distracting moving graphics or blinking images is
important for those with cognitive difficulties related to focus, and
for individuals with photosensitive epilepsy who may go into seizure
because of a blinking object set at a frequency of 5 to 30 Hertz
(flashes per second).</p>

<p>Everyone loves style! Industrial designers use it to attract people
to their products. Graphic designers use it to organize information on a
page and designate changes in topic. We’ll create organization of our
content, add meaning, and make it easier to navigate by adding Word
Styles. Word Styles are used to format headings, emphasized and strongly
emphasized text, links, paragraphs, and lists for example. When text is
formatted with <strong>Styles</strong> in Word, it creates a
navigational structure that screen reader users can use to quickly get
to the information they want.</p>
<p>Screen reader users use shortcut combinations of keys, for example,
to bring up a list of headings that can help them navigate to where they
want to go in the document faster. In JAWS, pressing the
<strong>Insert</strong> key followed by <strong>F6</strong> will bring
up a list of headings. The numbers behind the names of the headings,
such as 1, 2, and 3 designate heading level. It is good practice to
create one heading level 1 at the top of the page that describes what
the page is about, followed by subheading levels 2 through 6. In JAWS,
pressing of the <strong>H</strong> key will help a screen reader user
jump from heading to heading on a page. See a screen shot of what JAWS’
Heading List floating window looks like on top of a Word syllabus with
headings levels 1 and 2. Within this document, you can see that the
heading level 1 is the title of the document, “Syllabus for NUR 440.”
The syllabus is then broken up into sections, which are second level
headings.</p>

alt="JAWS pop-up window showing a list of headings in a Word syllabus" /></p>
<p>Once you add headings with Word Styles, you can see them in Word’s
<strong>NavigationPane</strong> to the left of the document. If you
don’t see the navigation pane, you can bring it up by going under the
<strong>View</strong> menu in Word and checking the box next to
<strong>Navigation Pane</strong>. It shows you the structure of your
page and can help people without disabilities also. See the screen shot
of the <strong>Navigation Pane</strong> and the box to enable this
outlined in red with a red arrow pointing to it (for accessibility
reason).</p>

to Apply a Word Heading Style</h2>
<p>In html, there are 6 heading levels represented by H1 through H6. H1
is typically your largest and/or most important heading of a document.
H2 headings would be subheadings of the H1 heading. H3 headings would be
subheadings of H2, H4 headings would be subheadings of H3, and so forth,
creating a visual and semantic hierarchy. The following graphic is a way
to visualize the hierarchy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/heading_Levels.gif" class="clear" width="600"
height="670"
alt="Visual display of heading levels 1 through 6 showing indented visual heirarchy" /></p>
<p>The heading level 1 at the top of this page will be the name of the
syllabus for a class, such as “Syllabus for Nursing 440.” It sums up
what the page is about. Once you type this in, highlight the text and
click the <strong>Heading 1</strong> style in Word’s
<strong>Styles</strong> bar at the top. You can expand the styles into a
pane that floats to the right, by pressing the tiny button,  with the
diagonal arrow that points toward the lower right, at the bottom right
of the styles menu. In the graphic below, the red arrow points to the
button to open the Styles pane.</p>

<p>The Styles pane is bordered by the red box in the image below,

alt="Screen shot of Word&#39;s Styles pane open on right side of Word window." /></p>
<p>A Note about the Title and Subtitle Styles:</p>
<p>If you use the Title or Subtitle style to designate Title text within
a Word document, this will not show up in a list of headings, within a
screen reader. It will also not convert to a &lt;title&gt; element if
the document is saved as a Web Page Filtered. Title and Subtitle text
gets converted to an ordinary paragraph element in HTML. If you use a
Heading level 1 to style your title or main subject, this will show up
in a list of headings to help the user navigate the page.</p>
<p>A note about Heading levels above 6:</p>
<p>Headings 1 through 6 should convert to their corresponding HTML
heading element (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;,
&lt;h5&gt;, and &lt;h6&gt;), but heading levels greater than this, such
as Heading 7 through Heading 9, will convert to paragraphs with custom
classes to affect their visual appearance, when a Word document is saved
as a Web Page Filtered. This isn’t semantically correct.</p>
<p>A note about text formatted as lists in Word:</p>
<p>I’m seeing each list item convert to a paragraph element in HTML
instead of their semantically correct &lt;li&gt; (list item).</p>

<p>If you don’t like a style, you can change it by right clicking on the
name of the style in the <strong>Styles</strong> pane, and selecting
“<strong>Modify</strong>.” In the image below, the text that has the
heading level 1 applied to it is selected at the top of the screen. It
is, “Syllabus for Nursing 440: Primary Preventive Strategies for
Communities,” outlined in a red box, pointed out by a large red arrow.
The Modify option is outlined in a thick red box also, pointed out by a
large red arrow.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/modify_style_h1-1.png" class="clear"
width="800" height="661"
alt="Screen capture of the pop up menu with the Modify option in Word." /></p>
<p>Within the <strong>Modify Style</strong> dialogue box, you’ll see
options to change the font, font size, font color, font weight,
emphasis, bolding, underlining, line spacing, space before and after a
line of text, indentation and alignment at the top. There are more
options available, like setting the language, by clicking the
<strong>Format</strong> button in the lower left of the <strong>Modify
Style</strong> window. These options are outlined in thick red boxes in
the image below, and pointed to by the large red arrows.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/modify_Style_dialogue-1.gif" class="clear"
width="800" height="651"
alt="Screen capture of Word&#39;s Modify Style pop-up window with the Formatting fields outlined in red." /></p>
<p>Control of the space between lines and before and after styled text,
without hitting the Return or Enter key, is important. If you format
with extra line returns or by hitting the space key multiple times, this
adds extra hidden characters to your layout. If a Word document is later
converted to a PDF, these extra returns create extra meaningless tags
that have to be deleted from a tagged PDF. You can see extra returns and
spaces within documents by clicking on the icon that looks like a
paragraph symbol under the Home ribbon. It looks like a backwards P and
is the <strong>Show/Hide</strong> button for showing paragraph returns,
spaces, tabs and other hidden characters.</p>
<p>You can add space above and below your selected text equally by using
the fourth and fifth buttons on the second row of the formatting area in
the Modify Style dialogue box. The button that increases spacing between
a heading and the surrounding content has two blue arrows, pointing away
from one another. The button that decreases space between a heading and
surrounding content has two blue arrows pointing at one another. You can
also adjust the spacing before and after the style of text by clicking
on the <strong>Format</strong> button at the bottom left of the
<strong>Modify Style</strong> dialogue and selecting
<strong>Paragraph</strong>.</p>

<p>Once in the <strong>Paragraph</strong> style dialogue menu, you can
see separate text boxes to enter the space before and space after. These
are outlined by the red box in the image below. A big red arrow points
to this box. You also see the ability to indent, align, and adjust line
spacing.</p>

<h2>Avoid the Use of the B or I Buttons under Word’s Home tab</h2>
<p>You’ll want to <em>avoid</em> the use of the B (bold) or I (Italic)
buttons and use the <strong>Strong</strong> or <strong>Emphasis</strong>
styles found in the <strong>Styles</strong> pane respectively.</p>

<p>If you would like your text bolded, use the <strong>Strong</strong>
style in Word’s Style pane. If you want to create italicized text, use
the <strong>Emphasis</strong> style in Word’s Style pane. These will
create the correct semantic structure for this type of text. Some screen
readers will change their tone of voice when reading to reflect Emphasis
(the style that looks like italic) and more Strongly emphasized text
(the style that looks like bold text). If the document is converted to
HTML, Strong and Emphasis will add the correct HTML tags around those
words.</p>

Word</h2>
<h2 class="chapter-author">Heather Caprette</h2>
</div>
<div class="ugc chapter-ugc">
<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>The addition of alternative text for images will help a blind user
know what is the content or function of an image. You’ll want to keep
your alt descriptions succinct, and equivalent to what the image is
conveying. If you have a chart or a graph, it’s best to describe what is
being represented in the chart or graph within the body of the document,
rather than in alt text. Or, if you can convey the information in the
chart or graph by way of a simple data table, this would also make the
content accessible. If you have an image that is a link, your alt text
can be the name of the page that the link leads to.</p>
<p>In HTML, we can add a null alt attribute to a decorative image that
doesn’t convey meaning, such as a flourish. This will tell the screen
reader to skip over it and not announce it at all. In more recent
versions of Word, unfortunately, there’s no way to do this. JAWS may be
set to announce images, even if they don’t contain
<strong>Description</strong> text. If you leave the
<strong>Description</strong> field blank for a decorative image, this
leaves the screen reader user wondering if the image contains meaning or
not, when it is announced. One way to get around this is, would be to
put a decorative image or flourish in the header or footer of a
document. Or, you could leave the image out. But, in Word, if you find
that you don’t want to leave the decorative image out, you should write
very brief <strong>Description</strong> text about what it is.</p>
<p>You can add alternative text by right mouse clicking on an image, and
choosing “<strong>Format Picture</strong>.” In the <strong>Format
Picture</strong> pane that opens to the right of the document, click on
the cross shape icon for “<strong>Layout &amp; Properties</strong>” of
the image. Click the arrow to the left of <strong>Alt text</strong> and
type a <strong>Description</strong> for the image. Why is there both a
Title and Description field under the Layout and Properties’ Alt Text
options, and which serves as the alt text? The Description text serves
as the alternative text and should always be filled in! Some screen
readers will read the Title text before the Description, such as JAWS 15
and newer, but some older screen readers, such as NVDA 2014.2 and
Window-Eyes 8.4 don’t. You can leave the Title text out. If you include
it, make it short and screen reader users can decide if they want to
hear the Description. But, also try to keep your Description text short
and succint (200 characters or less). It’s important that you write a
Description that conveys the images meaning, purpose, or where it leads
to. Don’t just describe what is in the image or write “image of.”</p>
<p>If you have an artistic image that conveys sensory information, such
as a painting or photograph, it is okay to describe what is in the
image, such as “photo of,” or “painting of.”</p>
<p>The choice of alt text depends on the context of the image. You don’t
want to be redundant and repeat text that is surrounding or adjacent to
the image.</p>
<h2>How to add an image to Word and add Alt Text to it</h2>
<p>To insert an image in Word, go under the <strong>Insert</strong> tab
and select <strong>Pictures</strong> from the ribbon. Browse to your
image, select it and click <strong>Insert</strong>. With the image
selected, right click on the image and select <strong>Format
Picture</strong> from the context menu that pops-up. From the Format
Picture pane options, select the icon that looks like four arrows
forming a white cross on a blue background. It is the <strong>Layout
&amp; Properties</strong> button. Expand the Alt Text option by clicking
on it. This brings up the <strong>Description</strong> field into which
you should type your alternative text. The image below shows the Layout
&amp; Properties button outlined in red and the Description field where
you would enter your alternative text.</p>

<p>At some point in a document or course creation, you’ll want to
provide links to other websites or pages. Screen reader users can bring
up a list of links on a page, much like they bring up lists of all the
headings on a page, or landmarks. In JAWS, a screen reader user does
this by pressing the <strong>Insert</strong> key followed by
<strong>F7</strong>.  It’s important to use descriptive text for your
links that convey where the link is going to or it’s purpose, so that
the links in this list make sense to a user taken out of context.  You
don’t want to use “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">click
here</span>” or “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">read
more</span>.” If there are more than one of these “<span
style="text-decoration: underline;">click here</span>” or “<span
style="text-decoration: underline;">read more</span>” links on a page, a
screen reader user may not remember, provided she or he read the page,
which “<span style="text-decoration: underline;">read more</span>” went
with which topic. It’s best to write the sentence in such a way to
provide link text that will describe the purpose of the link and where
it will lead to. The link text should be meaningful and unique from the
other link text on the page.</p>
<p>In the following example I’ll show you what you should avoid and then
how to rewrite and relink it for descriptive link text.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">In Word, the
<strong>ScreenTip</strong> option is similar to adding a
<strong>Title</strong> attribute to a link in html, or with the
Blackboard’s content editor. The Title attribute or ScreenTip will show
on screen to sighted users when the link is moused over or tabbed to,
that is, when the link has focus. The text for the ScreenTip or Title
attribute should be different from the link text. It is advisory in
nature, so in this case, we can write at ScreenTip that says, “<em>This
link will take you to the Copyright Advisory Network’s website.</em>”
We’ll do this by clicking on the <strong>ScreenTip</strong> button to
the right of the text entry box for <strong>Text to display</strong>.
The image below shows the Set Hyperlink ScreenTip window with the
ScreenTip text written in it. Be sure to click OK to close both
Hyperlink editing pop-up windows to save your changes.</span></p>

<p>Tables can be used to layout information that has a two way
relationship, or tabular data. Information that has a two-way
relationship is found in grading rubrics, evaluation information and
course schedules.</p>
<p>In HTML, header table cells are read by a screen reader before a
corresponding data cell to tell the user what the data is and give it
meaning. In HTML, a screen reader will read both column headers and row
headers. The column headers are in the rows above the data columns. A
row header would be found in a column on the far left typically. In a
rubric table layout, a column header cell might read as “exemplary
performance” and the data cell under it would read, “makes an original
post and replies to at least two classmates in the discussion.” The row
header for this may read as “participation.” An example of this is
below.</p>

<p>Word has limited ability to designate table header cells, and
unfortunately, JAWS doesn’t read the header cell text before each
associated data cell text in a Word document, to establish the
relationship. However, we should designate a header row in Word tables,
in case they are later turned into accessible PDF files, or web pages.
Tables with header rows that repeat upon page breaks also help sighted
users. We can designate column headers by selecting the top row of a
Word table, but we can’t create row headers out of a far left column,
for example. It’s best to setup simple tables with one header row across
the top. In the case of a table used to layout evaluation methods and
their associated points, we’ll designate the top row as a header by
selecting all cells in the first row, right clicking and selecting
<strong>Table Properties</strong>. See the screen shot of the menu with
<strong>Table Properties (outlined in a thick red box)</strong> that
appears after you right click on the highlighted contents of the top
row:</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/Table_Properties.gif" class="clear"

the <strong>Row</strong> tab, check the box next to “<strong>Repeat as a
header row across the top of each page</strong>.” See a screen shot of
this option outlined in a thick red box below.</span></p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/Row_Properties.gif" class="clear" width="856"
height="592"
alt="Select Row tab in the Table Properties menu, check off the box next to Repeat as header row at the top of each page, in Word." /></p>
<p>With table setup, it’s best to keep tables simple. Avoid blank cells
if possible and merged cells. Screen readers read linearly, from left to
right and top to bottom, row by row. It helps to keep this in mind when
setting up a Word table.</p>

avoid combining information that should be spread across more than one
table. If you merge and/or color cells to create a visual separation
from different content, JAWS may not read the information in an order
that makes sense to a screen reader user. The following example is from
a real table setup I’ve seen in a course. It’s one table that combines
what should have been an “Evaluation Methods” table and a separate
“Grading Scale” table.</span></p>

<p>In Word and HTML, you want to avoid combining tables, and cells if
possible. In this example, you’ll see how JAWS screen reader reads these
combined tables in a confusing and incomprehensible manner. The tables
lack header rows. The two visual headings that exist, “Assignment” and
“Maximum Grade” are formatted with the Bold button on the Word ribbon
instead of making them into a Table Header Row through Table
Properties.</p>
<p>This is a recreation of a real example I spotted in a course!
Remember to avoid blank table cells also.</p>

Layer</h2>
<h2 class="chapter-author">Heather Caprette</h2>

<div class="ugc chapter-ugc">
<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>In Word, there is a Document Layer and a Drawing Layer to a document.
Objects such as Text Boxes, Shapes, Smart Art, Charts, Word Art, and
Miscellaneous inserted Objects float in the Drawing Layer. These
floating objects may not be detected and read in the correct order when
a screen reader reads the text on the document. Though, modern versions
of Word, JAWS and NVDA are getting better. Both JAWS 17 and NVDA will
announce that there are embedded objects on a Word document. Word 16 has
a way to add alternative text to these objects, which is explained
below. JAWS will bring up a list of floating objects when the user
presses Control + Shift + O on her keyboard, but these objects may not
make sense when taken out of the flow of the document. NVDA doesn’t read
objects in the drawing layer.</p>
<p>If you set the objects to be <strong>In Line with Text</strong>, this
can often move them from the Drawing Layer to the Document Layer and
make them accessible. This can be done by selecting the object by
clicking on it. Click on the <strong>Layout Options</strong> icon to the
top right of the selection. It has horizontal lines and an arch, and
select <strong>In Line with Text</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/floatingObject_inlineWithText_Word2016.gif"
class="clear" width="800" height="389"
alt="Example of floating object in Word created by inserting Smart Art" /></p>
<p>Diagrams and illustrations created with Shapes and Smart Art can be
copied to the clip board and then reinserted as one image within the
document. You can save a copy of the document with the separate Smart
Art and Shapes in case you would need to go back and edit. In another
copy of the document, you would delete all the separate shapes that make
up your diagram, and insert the single image you’ve snipped. You can
then add alternative text in the Image <strong>Description</strong>
field for this one image, to make it accessible. In Windows, you can
copy the image to the clipboard with the Snipping Tool. To bring up the
Snipping Tool, enter “<strong>Snipping Tool</strong>” in Windows Search
box. The Search box which contains the default text, “<strong>Search for
programs and files</strong>,” is found by clicking <strong>Window’s
Start</strong> icon in the lower left of the screen. The Snipping Tool
program will appear at the top of the search results. Click it to open
it. The background will white out somewhat, and the Snipping Tool will
be a floating window. Under the <strong>New</strong> menu, select
<strong>Rectangular Snip</strong>, and then drag a rectangle around the
area of the screen you want to capture as one image.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/Snipping_Tool_1.gif" class="clear" width="800"
height="710"
alt="Windows&#39; Snipping Tool New menu activated with Rectangular Snip option" /></p>
<p>Once the image has been copied, you can go under the
<strong>File</strong> menu and select <strong>Save As</strong> to save
it as a .gif, .jpg, .png, or .mht. If the image contains large areas of
solid colors, GIF is a good format to choose. If the image is a
photograph or has subtle gradients, choose either JPG or PNG. MHT is a
proprietary Windows format which I can’t recommend. Sometimes, learning
management or content management servers don’t contain the MIME types to
display the format.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/Snipping_Tool_2.gif" class="clear" width="800"
height="486"
alt="Windows&#39; Snipping Tool with the File menu expanded. Select Save As to save the snip." /></p>
<p>After saving out your Word file as another document, go under the
<strong>Insert</strong> tab and select <strong>Pictures</strong> from
the ribbon. Browse to your newly created image, select it and click
<strong>Insert</strong>. With the image selected, right click on the
image and select <strong>Format Picture</strong> from the context menu
that pops-up. From the Format Picture pane options, select the icon that
looks like four arrows forming a white cross on a blue background. It is
the <strong>Layout &amp; Properties</strong> button. Expand the
<strong>Alt Text</strong> option by clicking on it. This brings up the
<strong>Description</strong> field into which you should type your
alternative text. The image below shows the <strong>Layout &amp;
Properties</strong> button outlined in a thick red box and the
<strong>Description</strong> field where you would enter your
alternative text.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/format_picture-1.gif" class="clear"
width="600" height="624"
alt="Word&#39;s Format Picture Layout and Properties Icon selected. Arrow pointing to Description field to write alternative text." /></p>
<p>On a Mac laptop or desktop, you can use press Command-Shift-4 on the
keyboard to bring up a tool similar to the Windows Snipping Tool that
will let you take a screen shot of a window on your desktop. There’s an
explanation of <a

http://www.macworld.com/article/2987618/os-x/how-to-take-screenshots-on-your-mac.html.</p>
<p>If you have an object that represents data, for example a bar chart,
you can explain the equivalent of the information presented within the
body of the document, or create a simple accessible data table, such as
in the example below. NVDA will read the table column headers before
each data cell. JAWS 17, in default settings read the column header row
once and then simply read the following rows linearly.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/bar_chart_and_data_table.gif" class="clear"
width="800" height="592"
alt="Word bar chart with table below it representing the same data." /></p>
<p>In Word 2016, there is the ability to add alternative text that
describes the data within the chart. JAWS 17 will recognize this
alternative text and read it. You can add alternative text to a chart by
selecting the whole thing (an outline will appear around the outer
perimeter), right click and select <strong>Format Chart Area</strong>.
When the Format Chart Area pane opens on the right side of the screen,
click on the <strong>Layout &amp; Properties</strong> icon (crossed
white arrows on blue background), and type the equivalent of the
information the chart presents within the <strong>Description</strong>
text entry box. You can add a title that represents what the chart is
about.</p>

<p>Text Boxes are frequently used in Word to draw attention to important
information. They float above the Document Layer and reside in the
Drawing Layer. Therefore, you’ll want to avoid the use of Text Boxes and
instead use and modify the Intense Quote style to make text stand out if
it is important, or create a custom style for this. The following movie

<p>Remember that screen readers will not present visual information,
such as bolding, borders, background colors and highlighting. Sometimes,
screen readers can be set to describe visual information, but it is not
typically done. The information can be overwhelmnig and irrelevant to
screen reader users. To designate important information, you can start
the sentence with “Attention,” or “Note.” “Warning,” and “Important” are
also usable choices to draw the attention of a screen reader user, as
well as sighted users.</p>

<p>The <strong>Accessibility Checker</strong> is a good place to start
when creating an accessible document out of an existing Word document,
or to check how accessible a document is that you are currently working
on. The Accessibility Checker pane will open on the right side and you
will see Errors, Warnings and Tips. I’ve heard some trainers say that
Errors are the things you must fix, Warnings are the things that should
be fixed and Tips aren’t as critical but should still be looked at. My
advice is to look at it all carefully, and use what you’ve learned in
this module to repair what you think are issues. Word provides
information about each issue when you select it in the Accessibility
Checker pane, at the bottom. It explains why you should fix it and gives
an explanation of how.</p>

<p>Blackboard will allow you to create a page using its WYSIWIG (What
you see is what you get) editing buttons within its content editor, or
switch to <strong>HTML Code View</strong> to add accessibility elements
and attributes. Blackboard’s content editor shows up within many of its
tools, such as discussion forum posting, assignment submissions, or
creation of Items or Blank Pages. The content editor has three rows of
buttons. If you don’t see three rows, you can click the upper right most
icon of the two downward pointing chevrons to expand its view.</p>

alt="Blackboard&#39;s Content Editor. The last button in the top row expands the bottom two rows. In the third row is the HTML editor button, second from the last button." /></p>
<p>Much of the content in this course was created with Blackboard’s
<strong>Blank Page</strong> tool. The buttons in this content editor
allow you to enter into pop-up windows that enable addition of images,
media files, tables, hypertext links, and math equations, to name
several content types. It also contains an <strong>HTML Code
View</strong> button that will allow you to manipulate the code that
generates the content the user will see. Sometimes, with Blackboard’s
content editor, it is necessary to enter into <strong>HTML Code
View</strong> to add accessibility features. It’s not hard and I’ll
guide you in what should be done.</p>

TIP: Turn off the Content Editor’s Spell Checker Feature</h4>
<p>You’ll want to turn off the Spell Checker within the practice course
you’ve been given for assignments to produce clean HTML that you can
work with. Your practice course will show up in your Blackboard course
list with a name that looks like
<em><strong>Online_Accessibility_Practice_Course_YourFirstInitialAndLastName</strong></em>.
You’re enrolled as an instructor within your practice course and have
full privileges. Unfortunately there is a bug in the current version of
Blackboard that causes multiple, useless &lt;span&gt; elements to be
placed around fragments of words, URLs, and anything the spell checker
thinks is misspelled. Since you will be editing code in HTML Code View,
it will help if you turn off the Spell Checker within your course. To do
this, click on <strong>Control Panel</strong> at the bottom of your
course menu, in the left navigation. This expands options available for
course management. Click on <strong>Customization</strong> to expand its
options. At the bottom of the Customization options, click on
<strong>Tool Availability</strong>. On the Tool Availability screen,
scroll down until you see <strong>Spell Check</strong> under the
<strong>Tool</strong> column. Uncheck the box beside it that controls
its <strong>Availability</strong>. Then scroll to the top of the page,
or bottom, and click the <strong>Submit</strong> button. This will make
the Spell Checker icon disappear from Blackboard’s Content Editor. When
it is available it appears as a button with ABC over a check mark. If
the tool is available and on, this button will be a darker shade of gray
from surrounding buttons, as seen at the end of the second row in the
image above.</p>
<p>Alternately, if you don’t want to turn off Spell Check completely for
your course, you can remember to turn it off within the instance of the
<strong>Content Editor</strong>, by clicking on the <strong>Spell Check
button</strong>, every time you go to edit content within your
Blackboard course. This is hard to remember to do, and inevitably
results in a time or two when you’ve forgotten and submitted, and then
found the multiple, useless &lt;span&gt; elements breaking up your code
when you go back to edit.</p>

<p>In the module on Word, we learned that font family, font size, line
height, and the contrast of the font against its background all effect
the accessibility and readability for the sighted, as well as those with
vision difficulties. It’s best to pick font families with a good
mid-weight stroke thickness, good space between letters, and medium
sized x-heights. An x-height is the height of the lower case letter x
within the font family. Avoid the use of fancy fonts, scripts and those
with thin strokes. Sans-serif fonts work better for body text on screen,
rather than fonts with serifs. Examples of good sans-serif fonts to use
are Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, Myriad Web Pro, Trebuchet, or Roboto. Serif
font families with good stroke weight and spacing for online display are
Georgia, Times New Roman, and Times. The image below shows a comparison
between font families. The upper four fonts, Amienne, Blackadder ITC,
Bradley Hand ITC, and Burnstown Dam, have thinness to their strokes, or
jagged appearance to the serifs which makes them hard to read on screen.
The bottom two fonts, Arial and Georgia, have more evenness to the width
of their strokes, and the strokes are straighter, making them easier to
read on screen.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/font_family_comparison-723x1024.gif"
class="clear" width="520" height="736"
alt="The same passage from a song represented in the following font families: Amienne Regular, Blackadder ITC, Bradley Hand ITC, Burnstown Dam, Arial and Georgia. The four families have poor on screen legibility and readability. Arial and Georgia display well on screen." /></p>
<p>If you write text from scratch, with no copying and pasting from
Word, into Blackboard’s content editor’s WYSIWYG mode, you’ll see
options to set the text type to Paragraph, Heading, Subheading 1, and
Subheading 2. These are OK, but you may not like the size of the text
they produce.  You’ll also see options to set the font family and its
size.  The sizes listed, such as Arial Size 3 (12pt), are a bit
misleading because the HTML generated behind the WYSIWYG interface sets
font sizes in the descriptive keyword units xx-small, x-small, small,
medium, large, x-large, and xx-large, not point (pt). These units are OK
because, if an end user sets her/his browser’s default font size to a
larger setting, these will scale up, which will help people with low
vision.</p>
<p>All font sizes should be specified in relative units that will scale
up or down when a user changes her default font size in her browser.
Other relative font size units include <em><strong>em</strong></em>, and
<em><strong>percent (represented as %).</strong></em> The typical
default browser font size is 16 pixels (px), but people with low vision
will increase this default font size to help them read. One em is the
height of the font you are using, usually thought of as the height of
the upper case M within that font. So, if a user doesn’t change the
default font size and the font size isn’t set in the code of an html
document or a CSS file,  1em would be equal to 16 px. The percent (%)
unit scales relative to the font size of a parent HTML element, or the
default font size set in the browser. So, if a parent HTML element
contains a font size of 16 px (pixels), font set to 125% would be 20 px
heigh. Please view the following movie demonstration that shows how
fonts set in em, rem and percent (%) scale with a change of the default
browser font size, while fonts specified in pixels (px) and points (pt)
don’t.</p>

<p>When you copy content from other sources, such as Word or from a
website, you copy over styling code with it that may not help people
with vision difficulties who choose to increase their default font size
in their browser. Font sizes for content copied from Word usually end up
as points (pt), and font sizes from content copied from websites can end
up being in pixels (px). This can be seen after you copy the content
into Blackboard’s content editor, by toggling into the <strong>HTML Code
View</strong>. The font sizes in points and pixels should be converted
to <em><strong>em</strong></em> or <em><strong>percent
(%)</strong></em>. The following chart, taken and modified from <a
href="http://reeddesign.co.uk/test/points-pixels.html" target="_blank"
rel="noopener" title="Reed Design&#39;s font-size conversion chart">Reed
Design</a>, will show you equivalent em and percent (%) units for point
(pt) and pixel (px) units that get copied into Blackboard from other
sources, like Word documents. You can use this chart to convert your
font sizes in Blackboard’s HTML Code View.  If for example, you had a
heading that was 18 pt, copied from Word, you would want to change it to
1.5 em. A 16 pt subheading, copied from Word, should be changed to 1.4
em. I’ve also added in where the fonts specified with descriptive
keywords would fall. Please view the following movie tutorial
demonstrating how to format text copied from Word into Blackboard
Learn’s content editor for accessibility. This demonstration will also
show you how to increase line-height between list items in HTML Code
View, using inline styling. This increase of space between lines will
help with readability also.</p>

<h4>Remember to Check Your Color Contrast</h4>
<p>Color contrast for a normal body type that is 12 pt, or 16px, against
its background would be 4.5:1. This will pass WCAG 2.0 level AA
standard. If you really want to pass the AAA level, the best, you would
want a contrast of 7:1 between the font color and its background. Use
the <strong><a
href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">free Colour Contrast
Analyser</a></strong> from the Paciello Group’s website, that you
learned about within the Word module, to help you determine if your
color choices meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA. If you have a larger font, which
would be 14 pt bold (19 px, or 1.2 em) or 18 pt (24 px or 1.5 em), the
contrast ratio can be lower. In this case, it should be 3:1 or greater
to meet level AA of WCAG 2.0 standards for contrast. If you would like
to review the movie demonstration of Colour Contrast Analyser, you can
replay it below.</p>

</div>
<h4>Remember Not to Use Color Alone to Convey Meaning</h4>
<p>Colour Contrast Analyser will also help you see your design as
someone with one of the color blindnesses, as we learned in the module
on Word accessibility. Often, we format important text with color alone,
such as red, but this text doesn’t appear red to someone with protonopia
or deuteranopia. When designating something as important, use an
asterisk (*) or write the word “IMPORTANT” before the content that you
want special emphasis put on. You can also enclose the text with the
<strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> element to make it appear bold and give
a strong semantic emphasis to it. The
<em><strong>&lt;em&gt;</strong></em> element will give emphasis to text
by making it appear italicized. Fortunately, Blackboard’s content editor
will add a &lt;strong&gt; tag around words that you select and format
with the editor’s “bold” button. It is the first button in the first
row, with a bold capital letter T. Blackboard’s content editor also adds
an &lt;em&gt; tag around words that you select and format with its
“italic” button. This is the second button in the first row, with an
italic letter T.</p>
<p>Another best practice is to make sure your links are underlined and
use the underlining only on links. Blue, underlined text has been used
as a default style for links from the early stages of the web. It’s best
not to remove the underlines, even if you choose a different color for
your linked text. This could cause a user to miss important content, and
in a teaching and learning setting, could lower a student’s grade. I
know first hand, because I was in a course that changed its link styling
from underlined to non-underlined between modules and pages. Consistency
in design is important for usability and accessibility!</p>
<h4>Avoid Busy Background Images Behind Text</h4>
<p>Placing text directly over a background image can hurt readability
also, especially an image with great detail, many tonalities, and
semi-transparent font. You can solve the problem by placing the text
within a solid color box whose background contrasts sufficiently with
the font color. This would be best. But, some designers have been able
to blur background images that are photographs with enough contrast with
the font, and put a drop shadow behind the font, or outline it in black
to improve readability in this situation.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a sign that is difficult to read for people
with good vision. The photograph’s been taken from approximately the
position that a passenger riding in a car on the street in front of the
sign would have. The designer has made a white CSU seal semi-transparent
against a red background, and superimposed solid white text on top of
the semi-transparent white seal. Though the very large “Fire Lane” is
readable due to its size, the fine print about having your car cited,
booted, and towed if you dare park there, isn’t readable. The white text
message about the fire lane competes with the “Cleveland State
University 1964” text of the seal for our attention.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/fireLane_sign_streetPerspective.jpg"
class="clear" width="500" height="723"
alt="CSU Fire lane sign with water mark of white seal against a red background, somewhat transparent white seal. Small white text printed over the faded seal isn&#39;t readable from passenger side of car in lane." /></p>
<p>Here is another example of text over an image, that helps solve the
readability problem. The photograph is blurred and the dark grays
provide contrast with the white “AACSB Accreditation matters” text,
which has a drop shadow around it. The designer has also placed the
AACSB International Challenge text message over a solid blue background
and put the “Challenge” in all caps. The contrast ratio between the
white font and the medium blue background is 4.7:1, which passes WCAG
2.0 color contrast level AA for regular text, and level AAA for large
text. When the image is filtered for the various color blindnesses and
cataracts, we see that the small “INTERNATIONAL” is the hardest text to
read.</p>

<p>One of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines is to provide
equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content. We’ll talk about
adding alt text for images here. Though, the same principles apply to
audio-visual media, applets, or non-text objects and embeds.</p>
<p>The addition of alternative text for images will help someone who is
blind or has vision difficulties know what is the content, purpose or
function of an image. It can also help sighted users with mobility
impairments, who are using dictation software to navigate, when an image
is also a link. Alt text helps sighted users who may be using a browser
with images turned off, perhaps to load pages faster, save on bandwidth
or data usage when roaming. Alt text will also help search engines index
your images.</p>
<p>Alt text (short for alternative text) is a complex topic to discuss.
You’ll get different ideas about what alt text should be, depending on
what reference you read, or who you talk to. All images presented in an
HTML document should have what is referred to as an <em>alt</em>
attribute. The <em>alt</em> attribute will either contain text that
conveys the meaning or function of the image, or it will be left empty
or null. Images generally fall within three types: functional,
informative and decorative. Decorative images always use a null (or
empty) alt attribute and the functional and informative images sometimes
use a null alt attribute or they require text that conveys the meaning
or function of the image. Whether or not an image requires alternative
text within the alt attribute, or if it is left empty (null) depends on
its context within the page. The <a

Accessibility Initiative</a> has a good tutorial on alternative text and
a <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
title="The Web Accessibility Initiative&#39;s decision making guide as to whether or not you need alt text.">decision
tree</a> for helping you decide how to write the alt attribute. <a
href="http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext" target="_blank"
rel="noopener"
title="Web Accessibility In Mind&#39;s guide to writing alternative text">WebAIM’s
article on alt text</a> is helpful also, but some of their scenarios
don’t have an objective right or wrong way.</p>
<p>We’ll look at examples of the different types of images and discuss
how to write the HTML code for accessibility. Alternative text as well
as a title (screen tip) can be created with the non-code, WYSIWYG part
of Blackboard’s content editor, when inserting an image. Within
Blackboard’s content editor, an empty alt attribute can be added by
simply putting your cursor within the <strong>Image Description</strong>
field and pressing your spacebar once to create one empty space. You can
then toggle over into the <strong>HTML Code View</strong> and delete
this space to make the alt attribute null.</p>
<p>The following are general guidelines for alternative text:</p>
<ul>
<li>The text alternative should be equivalent to the meaning, purpose or
function of the image</li>
<li>Keep it short. Usually a few words will do, but sometimes a sentence
or two may be needed. Images requiring a longer description can use a
longdesc attribute that links to another page with a more comprehensive
description, or the information can be written within the body of the
document that contains the image.</li>
<li>Use a null or empty alt text attribute if the same information is
presented in the text adjacent to the image, or if the image is purely
decorative. The former is to reduce redundancy when the information is
read to the end user.</li>
<li>Don’t start the alt text with “image of” or “graphic of.” A screen
reader announces when it encounters an image. You may explain that the
image is an illustration, painting or photograph when it conveys
content, such as in an Art History course that displays many examples of
paintings showing different styles or subject matter.</li>
<li>For functional images, don’t start the alt text with “link to.” A
screen reader announces that it is a link.</li>
</ul>

<p>The example below gives information about flooding in an emergency
preparedness course. Would you consider the photograph below the text to
be informative or decorative? Does it convey important supplemental
information that the surrounding text doesn’t?</p>
<h2>Flooding:</h2>
<p>The National Weather Service (NWS) issues flood advisories. A flash
flood occurs within 6 hours of excessive rainfall and poses a threat to
life and/or property. The following are advisories the NWS issues.</p>
<ol>
<li>Flash Flood Watch: A flash flood watch typically occurs 6 to 24
hours in advance of expected flooding.</li>
<li>Flash Flood Warning: A flash flood warning is issued when flooding
is occurring or imminent.</li>
<li>Flood Warning: A flood warning is declared when general flooding is
occurring, imminent, or likely.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/flooded_bridge_pg22.jpg" class="clear"
width="642" height="445"
alt="flooded river flowing over the top of a bridge and the banks near houses. Distressed onlookers standing at edge of water." /></p>
<p>Let’s say that I determine that the photograph does show important
information I would like to get across to the audience. It shows an
important impact of a flash flood. Here’s how I could go about adding
the alternative text in Blackboard’s content editor.</p>
<ol>
<li>With your cursor insertion at the point where you want to insert the
image, click the <strong>Insert/Edit Image</strong> icon in the text
editor. It is the second icon from the left in the third row, with a
picture of a mountain. It’s outlined with a red box below.<img
src="OEBPS/assets/01_iconToInsertImage.gif" class="clear" width="800"
height="661"
alt="The insert/edit image button highlighted in Blackboard Learn&#39;s content editor. Third row down, second button from left." /></li>
<li>Browse to the location on your computer or in the course, by
clicking on the <strong>Browse My Computer</strong> button or
<strong>Browse Course</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select it by clicking on the name of the image file, and click
<strong>Open</strong>.The <strong>Image URL</strong> will appear.
Blackboard gives an image a unique URL once it has been uploaded to a
course.</li>
<li>Next, in the text entry box for <strong>Image Description</strong>,
type the alternative text you have in mind for this image. Try to keep
it short and succinct. If it goes over two sentences, you’ll need a long
description instead. For this image, I chose to write, “A flooded river
crests over the top of a bridge, extending onto the banks and roadway of
a nearby community, where onlookers stand in frustration.” I chose to
leave the title text box empty since I don’t have advisory information
that I want to show as a screen tip for this image. <em>The point to
take away is that the <strong>Image Description</strong> serves as the
alt text.</em><img src="OEBPS/assets/02_addingImageDescription1.gif"
class="clear" width="800" height="357"
alt="Blackboard Learn&#39;s Insert/edit image window with Browse My Computer highlighted. This is how you select the image on your hard drive. The Image Description field is highlighted. This is where you add the alt text." /></li>
<li>The Appearance tab has some other options for styling the image that
you might like to set before clicking the Insert button at the bottom of
the Insert/Edit Image dialogue box. It has some older options for
creating white space around an image so that it doesn’t butt up against
surrounding content. These are called Vertical Space and Horizontal
Space. I’ll set 5 for five pixels of white space both vertically, above
and below the image, and horizontally, to the sides of the image. I’ll
also set a 1 pixel wide border around it to help separate it from the
background. As I set these styles, the HTML code is written in the Style
text entry box. You can add styling here, or in the HTML Code View.<img
src="OEBPS/assets/03_imageAppearance.gif" class="clear" width="800"
height="304"
alt="Blackboard Learn&#39;s insert/edit image Appearance tab, with the tab highlighted." /></li>
</ol>
<p>The code that Blackboard adds for the image looks like the
following:</p>
<p>&lt;img
src=”https://bb–csuohio.blackboard.com/courses/1/Inclusive_Online_Design_1/content/_2019925_1/embedded/flooded_bridge_pg22.jpg”
alt=”A flooded river crests over the top of a bridge, extending onto the
banks and roadway of a nearby community, where onlookers stand in
frustration.” style=”margin: 5px; border: 1px solid black;” height=”445″
width=”642″ /&gt;</p>
<p>Blackboard’s content editor uses the dimensions of the image to set
the height and width in pixels. You can delete the height value
(height=”445″) and change the width value (width=”642″) to a percentage.
You would choose a percentage that you want the width of the image to
take up within its containing element, which is the central white
background content area in Blackboard. For the flooding image, I chose
40%. Percent is a relative unit that will allow the image to scale up
and down with a resize of the browser window. This minimizes scrolling
horizontally, which helps with accessibility and usability. So, in HTML
Code View, the final code for the image would look like:</p>
<p>&lt;img
src=”https://bb-csuohio.blackboard.com/courses/1/Best_Practices_Accessible_Online_Design_Accessibility_Committee/content/_2171113_1/embedded/flooded_bridge_pg22.jpg”
alt=”A flooded river crests over the top of a bridge, extending onto the
banks and roadway of a nearby community, where onlookers stand in
frustration.” style=”margin: 5px; border: 1px solid black;” width=”40%”
/&gt;</p>
<h4>Banner Example</h4>
<p>In the case of a logo or banner for a department, you can simply use
the text within the image, or the department or school name that it
represents as the alternative text. For the School of Nursing banner,
the alt text would be “School of Nursing.” The code would look like the
following:</p>
<p>&lt;img
src=”https://bb-csuohio.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-2171113-dt-content-rid-11788111_1/xid-11788111_1″
<strong>alt=”School of Nursing” width=”90%”</strong> /&gt;</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/school_of_nursing.jpg"
class="alignleft size-full wp-image-278" width="570" height="110"

<p>Images of charts, graphs and diagrams convey more information than
can be conveyed with a short alt text attribute. In this case, we need
to find a way to present a longer description of the data contained in
the chart, graph or diagram. One way to do this would be to summarize
the information within the body of the page. Another way is to represent
the same data that is graphically displayed in a chart, within an
accessible table, with headers and a summary. You’ll learn about how to
add table headers, captions and summaries later in this module. However,
I’ll show you a method of adding a complex image and its alternative
text, including a long description, with the add <strong>Image</strong>
feature in Blackboard Learn.</p>
<p>To add an image of a bar chart with an alternative text and a long
description:</p>
<ol>
<li>With <strong>Edit</strong> mode set to <strong>On</strong>, there is
an <strong>Actions Bar</strong> at the top center of the content region
which will allow you to add content. Click on the <strong>Build
Content</strong> option.</li>
<li>Within the <strong>Build Content</strong> menu of this
<strong>Actions Bar</strong>, select to add an <strong>Image</strong>.
This menu option is shown in the image below.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Build_Content_Image.png" class="clear"
style="width:60.0%"
alt="Blackboard&#39;s Build Content menu expanded with Image and Build Content highlighted." /></li>
<li>In the <strong>Create Image</strong> dialogue box that pops up, give
your data image a Name or title in the text entry box next to
<strong>Name</strong>. This should express what the data or information
is about. In the final display, it will show above the image of the
chart, graph or diagram.</li>
<li>Next, you can locate the image file by browsing your computer, the
course files (provided you’ve already uploaded the file to the course),
or select a Flickr Photo from the Mashups feature. Select one of the
<strong>Browse</strong> buttons below the Color of the Name box
(defaults to black).<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Create_Image_01b.png" class="clear"
style="width:80.0%"
alt="Blackboard&#39;s Create Image window with the Name field and File File buttons highlighted." /></li>
<li>Enter a short, concise alternative description of the data
represented by the chart, graph or diagram in the text entry box next to
<strong>Alt Text</strong>. The <strong>Alt Text</strong> will not be
seen by sighted users viewing the image on the page, but will be read by
screen readers.</li>
<li>Next, in an accurate way, describe all of the information conveyed
by the chart, graph or diagram. This will be written in the <strong>Long
Description</strong> text entry box. In the final display, the
<strong>Long Description</strong> will show beneath the image of your
chart, graph or diagram. Write the long description as if you are
conveying the information to someone on the other end of a phone
call.<br />

<h2 class="chapter-title">Creating an Empty or Null Alt Attribute for
Decorative Images</h2>
<h2 class="chapter-author">Heather Caprette</h2>
</div>
<div class="ugc chapter-ugc">
<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>A decorative image is one that doesn’t convey meaning nor add
information to the page. Examples of decorative images include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Images that serve as borders, spacers, corners, flourishes</li>
<li>Images adjacent to text that convey the same meaning or information
as the text, e.g. an image of Abraham Lincoln next to the text link
“Abraham Lincoln.” You want to avoid redundancy when a screen reader
reads what is there.</li>
<li>Images adjacent to text that serve as “eye-candy,” or “ambience,”
and don’t add information.</li>
<li>Images used next to link text simply to improve its appearance or
increase its clickable area</li>
</ol>
<p>Decorative images require the addition of an empty or null alt
attribute in the <strong>HTML Code View</strong> that will tell the
screen reader to skip over the image. An empty alt attribute is written
as alt=” ” with a space between the double quotes. A null alt text is
written as <strong>alt=””</strong> with no space between the set of
quotes. Without a null or empty alt attribute, the screen reader will
announce that there is an image, and possibly give its dimensions, but
leave the audience wondering what the image is and if it is
important.</p>
<p>You can produce an <strong>empty</strong> alt attribute (alt=” “) by
typing one space with your spacebar within the <strong>Image
Description</strong> field when inserting an image with Blackboard’s
content editor. This is the easy route. When the content is read back
with JAWS 17 in Firefox, it will skip over the images without announcing
them at all. NVDA will announce “graphic” but give no dimensions or
other information. If you use a <strong>null</strong> alt attribute on
an image, NVDA will skip over it without announcing it. JAWS 17 will
also skip over an image without announcing it when there is a null alt
attribute set. <em>Therefore, it’s best practice to create a null alt
attribute on a decorative image or one that doesn’t convey information
that is not on the page</em>.</p>
<p>Below is an example of a decorative image of a flourish that might be
used at the top of a page or a separator for sections of a document. It
would require the null alt attribute on the image element in HTML. The
HTML code for this image would look like the following:</p>
<p>&lt;img src=”flourish.jpg alt=””&gt;</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/flourish.gif" class="clear" width="659"
height="105" alt="decorative flourish" /></p>
<p>***IMPORTANT: Blackboard’s content editor, won’t create null alt text
attributes on an image if you simply leave the <strong>Image
Description</strong> blank when inserting an image. That is, if you
leave the Image Description field blank and then click on the
<strong>HTML Code View</strong> button after you have inserted the
image, you won’t see &lt;img alt=””&gt; anywhere.</p>
<p>To setup an image with null alt text, insert the image with the
<strong>Insert/Edit Image</strong> icon as you would normally, but leave
the <strong>Image Description</strong> field empty, as seen in the image
below. Don’t worry about this right now.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/decorativeImage_01.gif" class="clear"
width="800" height="343"
alt="Blackboard&#39;s Insert/Edit Image window with the Browse My Computer button highlighted." /></p>
<p>When you get a pop-up dialogue window warning you that you need to
include an image description to make the image accessible, click OK.
When that dialogue disappears, click <strong>Insert</strong> to finish
inserting your image.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/decorativeImage_021.gif" class="clear"
width="800" height="341"
alt="Blackboard&#39;s Insert/Edit Image window with the OK button highlighted, when it asks if you are sure you want to leave the Description field empty. Click OK." /></p>
<p>Next, you’ll need to toggle into <strong>HTML Code View</strong>
using the <strong>HTML</strong> icon which is second from the right in
the third row, to edit the code.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/decorativeImage_03.gif" class="clear"
width="800" height="336"
alt="Blackboard&#39;s Content Editor with the HTML button highlighted and the flourish decorative image displaying." /></p>
<p>You’ll see the code that Blackboard’s content editor created for the
image. It will look like the following:</p>
<p>&lt;img
src=”https–csuohio.blackboard.com/sessions/3/4/2/0/8/8/4/7/session/ff9f70436e4a4ab9a27a283871716715/flourish%281%29.gif”
height=”105″ width=”659″ /&gt;.</p>
<p>You can see the really long location and name change that Blackboard
created for the image, ending in the file format, which is gif. You’ll
also see height and width attributes. You can add a null alt attribute
any where after <em>img</em> plus a space. We’ll add it just after the
source (<em>src</em>) pathway to the gif. Place your cursor just before
the <em>h</em> in height and type alt=””, and then a space. The code
will now look like:</p>
<p>&lt;img
src=”https://bb–csuohio.blackboard.com/sessions/3/4/2/0/8/8/4/7/session/ff9f70436e4a4ab9a27a283871716715/flourish%281%29.gif”
<strong>alt=””</strong> height=”105″ width=”659″ /&gt;</p>
<h4>Creating a Fluid Image Size</h4>
<p>We’ll make the image respond to changes in the browser window size,
by changing its width to a percent value. Setting its width to a
percentage of the container it is in, will allow it to scale
proportionately downward with a decrease in window size. This technique
can also avoid the need for horizontal scrolling if the window gets
smaller than the width of the picture. We’ll delete height=”105″ and
width=”659″ from the code above, so that it looks like the
following:</p>
<p>&lt;img
src=”https://bb.blackboard.com/sessions/3/4/2/0/8/8/4/7/session/ff9f70436e4a4ab9a27a283871716715/flourish%281%29.gif”
alt=””  /&gt;</p>
<p>We’ll now create a width that uses percent as a value. I’ll use 90%.
I like to make the image slightly less than 100% of its container, to
create some white space on the left and right of the image. To enter the
width=”90%”, I leave a space after alt=”” and type the new property. The
final code will look like:</p>
<p>&lt;img
src=”https://bb–csuohio.blackboard.com/sessions/3/4/2/0/8/8/4/7/session/ff9f70436e4a4ab9a27a283871716715/flourish%281%29.gif”
<strong>alt=”” width=”90%”</strong> /&gt;</p>
<p>A note about image sizing: If your image dimension in pixels is a
smaller percentage of the parent container than the percent that you
write, there will be some scaling up, which could lead to a less
detailed display of the image. Blackboard’s content area scales down to
a minimum width of 1150 pixels before it stops responding to a decrease
in the width of the browser’s display.</p>
<p>Below is a comparison chart you can use to determine the percentage
that an image of a certain numbers of pixels will take up when
Blackboard’s content area is scaled down to its minimum width. If the
browser window is scaled up, the image will still occupy the percentage
of space that you designate, but pixels will not be added to your image
to maintain image quality.</p>

<p>There is another method to make the image respond to a decreased
screen size and eliminate the need for horizontal scrolling, but the
execution isn’t perfect within Blackboard. Blackboard clips a small
portion of the image on the right side. This method uses the max-width
property for sizing the image. With the <strong>HTML Code View</strong>,
you set the max-width of the image to be 100% of the containing parent
element, and set the height to auto. In this case, the image will scale
down to fit a window smaller than its original width in pixels (down to
the minimum width of 1150 pixels in Blackboard), but it won’t scale up
if the window size is larger than its width in pixels. The code would
look like the following:</p>
<p>&lt;img alt=””
src=”https://bb–csuohio.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-2020261-dt-content-rid-11186514_1/xid-11186514_1″
style=”max-width: 100%; height: auto;” /&gt;</p>
<h4>Decorative Image Example #2:</h4>
<p>The following example shows the use of an image (the Start button)
beside text to draw the user’s eye to important information. This helps
sighted users and can help people with low vision or cognitive
impairments orient. The image of a round button that says “Start”
repeats the same information or has the same meaning as the text heading
“Start Here” which is located above it. So, it won’t add meaning for
someone listening to a screen reader. Therefore, we’ll but a null alt
attribute on this image so that a screen reader skips over it.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/start_here.gif" class="clear" width="600"
height="121"
alt="Link to content folder in Blackboard called &quot;Start Here&quot; with a &quot;Start&quot; icon below it and text that says, &quot;This folder contains instructions and a general overview of the course.&quot;" /></p>
<p>The yellow folder icon indicates that the author added a folder of
content to her Blackboard course. To create the folder called “Start
Here!” you can add a <strong>Content Folder</strong> from the
<strong>Build Content</strong> menu on Blackboard’s <strong>Action
Bar</strong>, with <strong>Edit</strong> mode <strong>On</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/Content_Folder.png" class="clear" width="505"
height="705"
alt="Blackboard&#39;s Build Content menu expanded with Content Folder highlighted." /></p>
<p>Type the name of your Content Folder, such as Start Here! in the
<strong>Name</strong> text entry box.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/Content_Folder_Text_Description.png"
class="clear" style="width:90.0%"
alt="Blackboard&#39;s Create Content Folder window with an area for a Name and Text description" /></p>
<p>To create the Start button image to the left of the text description
of the folder, you can copy and paste the following code within
<strong>HTML Code View</strong> for the Text description box:</p>
<p>&lt;div style=”color: #000; padding: 1.5em; font-size: 1 em;
font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial, Helvetica,
sans-serif;”&gt;&lt;img
src=”https://bb-csuohio.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-2171115-dt-content-rid-11267299_1/xid-11267299_1″
style=”margin: 0px 10px;” height=”50″ width=”50″ alt=”” /&gt; This
folder contains instructions and a general overview of the
course.&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>The image below shows the code pasted into the HTML Code View
dialogue window, superimposed over the WYSIWYG editor. Note that the
spell checker button, outlined in red, is turned off. It is the ABC icon
with the check mark. This is to avoid the unnecessary insertion of
&lt;span&gt; elements in your code, due to a bug in the current version
of Blackboard Learn. The HTML button clicked to enter into HTML Code
View is also outlined in red.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/HTML_Code_View_01-1024x608.gif" class="clear"
style="width:90.0%"
alt="Blackboard&#39;s HTML Code Editor window showing code for the inserted image." /></p>
<p>*** Note: This code will work for centering the alignment vertically
for one small image and one short line of text beside it. If you have a
larger image and want to wrap a paragraph of text to the right of it
within Blackboard Learn’s content editor, please see the section on
<em>Creating a Fluid Wrap of Text Around an Image</em>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-title">Creating Alt Text for Functional Images</h2>
<h2 class="chapter-author">Heather Caprette</h2>
</div>
<div class="ugc chapter-ugc">
<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>Functional images are images that are linked or initiate an action,
such as submission of a form or a search query. If the image isn’t
beside text that conveys the same function, then it will need alt
text.</p>
<p>Below are some examples of functional image situations.</p>
<h2>A Logo and Seal Image</h2>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/CSU-Logo-NoTag-Split-2015.png" class="clear"
width="260" height="54"
alt="Cleveland State University&#39;s logotype with seal." /></p>
<p>In general, it’s best not to use text inside images for buttons, or
links. If you can create these buttons or links with HTML and CSS, they
should be created this way. Logos are exceptions. In the case of a logo,
the alt text should convey what the image conveys. For example, if it is
Cleveland State University’s logo or seal, you can simply use
alt=”Cleveland State University” rather than describing it. You wouldn’t
want to write alt=”Cleveland State University logo and seal“. The code
for the image above is:</p>
<p>&lt;img
src=”https://bb–csuohio.blackboard.com/courses/1/Inclusive_Online_Design_1/content/_2033036_1/embedded/CSU-Logo-NoTag-Split-2015.png”
<strong>alt=”Cleveland State University”</strong> style=”margin: 5px;
border: 1px solid black;” width=”260″ height=”54″ /&gt;</p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 2em;">Logo Image that Links to a Home Page</h2>
<p>If the Cleveland State University logo is linked and leads to the CSU
home page, you can use the destination of the action the image performs,
alt=”Cleveland State University Home Page”.</p>
<p><a href="http://csuohio.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img
src="OEBPS/assets/CSU-Logo-NoTag-Split-2015.png" class="clear"
width="260" height="54"
alt="Cleveland State University&#39;s logotype with seal." /></a></p>
<p>The code for this situation would look like the following:</p>
<p>&lt;a href=”http://www.csuohio.edu” title=”This link takes you to
Cleveland State University’s Home Page” target=”_blank”&gt;&lt;img
src=”https://bb-csuohio.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-2171116-dt-content-rid-11787785_1/xid-11787785_1″
<strong>alt=”Cleveland State University Home Page”</strong> title=”This
link takes you to CSU’s home page” style=”margin: 5px; border: 1px solid
black;” height=”54″ width=”260″ /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>If a College or School logo is used with the CSU seal, as in the
following example, you can use the destination of the action the image
performs, alt=”Cleveland State University School of Nursing Home
Page”.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/NursingLogo.png" class="clear" width="240"
height="84"
alt="School of Nursing with CSU seal to left of text." /></p>
<p>The code for the example above looks like the following:</p>
<p>&lt;a href=”http://www.csuohio.edu/nursing/home”
target=”_blank”&gt;&lt;img
src=”https://bb-csuohio.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-2171116-dt-content-rid-11787936_1/xid-11787936_1″
<strong>alt=”Cleveland State University School of Nursing Home
Page”</strong> style=”margin: 5px; border: 1px solid black;” height=”84″
width=”240″ /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<h2>Icons to Inform File Type</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll use icons to represent what a linked file type for
download is. These icons may be for Word, PowerPoint or PDF formats, for
example. The example below represents this.</p>
<p><a
href="http://www.csuohio.edu/nursing/sites/csuohio.edu.nursing/files/media/graduate_programs/documents/GNR%20Student%20Handbook.pdf"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nursing Graduate Student Handbook <img
src="OEBPS/assets/pdf_icon_50px.png"
class="size-full wp-image-337 alignnone" width="50" height="50"
alt="PDF" /></a></p>
<p>The code for this example looks like the following:</p>
<p>&lt;a
href=”http://www.csuohio.edu/nursing/sites/csuohio.edu.nursing/files/media/graduate_programs/documents/GNR%20Student%20Handbook.pdf”
target=”_blank”&gt;Nursing Graduate Student Handbook &lt;img
src=”https://bb–csuohio.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-2033036-dt-content-rid-11256471_1/xid-11256471_1″
<strong>alt=”PDF”</strong> style=”margin: 1px;” width=”50″ height=”50″
/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>
<p>Notice that the alt text, “PDF” doesn’t repeat text that is used for
the link, which is good practice.</p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 2em;">Icons that Represent an Action</h2>
<p>Icons that represent an action could be a magnifying glass to submit
a search, a printer icon to print a page, a phone icon to call a phone
number, a twitter icon to send a tweet, a submit image to submit a form.
In these cases, for alt text, we would not describe what the icon looks
like, but what it will do. Therefor, we would not write alt=”magnifying
glass” for the magnifying glass icon that submits a search term, but we
would write alt=”search”.</p>
<p>In the example below, the phone icon launches a phone application to
call someone, the email icon launches an email application to email
someone, and the twitter icon opens twitter to send a tweet to someone.
In each case, the icon is linked but the text beside is not. If the text
beside it were descriptive links, we could use alt=”” for the images if
they were included inside the html link. To give them the same alt
attribute as the descriptive link, would be redundant.</p>
<p>Contact Information:</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/phone_40px.png" class="alignleft wp-image-339"
width="24" height="24" alt="phone elearning" /> 1 (216) 687-3960</p>

<h2 class="chapter-title">Setting up Descriptive Links and the Title
Attribute in Blackboard Learn</h2>

<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>At some point in document or course creation, you’ll want to provide
links to other websites or pages. Screen reader users can bring up a
list of links on a page, much like they bring up lists of all the
headings on a page, or landmarks. In JAWS, a screen reader user does
this by pressing the Insert key followed by F7. It’s important to use
descriptive text for your links that convey where the link is going to,
so that the links in this list make sense to a user taken out of
context. You don’t want to use “click here” or “read more.” If there are
more than one of these “click here” or “read more” links on a page, a
screen reader user may not remember, provided she or he read the page,
which “read more” went with which topic. It’s best to write the sentence
in such a way to provide link text that will describe the purpose of the
link and where it will lead to. The link text should be meaningful and
unique from the other link text on the page.</p>
<p>In the following example I’ll show you what you should avoid and then
how to rewrite and relink it for descriptive link text.</p>
<p>Avoid this type of writing and linking:</p>
<p>“For more information about Fair Use of copyrighted materials, click
here. For information about a Fair Use Evaluator that can help you
decide if your specific use of copyrighted material favors Fair User or
not, click here. For a chart that shows a list of conditions that favor
or oppose Fair Use, click here.</p>
<p>How you could reword the text to provide descriptive text links:</p>
<p>“More information about Fair Use of copyrighted materials can be
found on the Copyright Advisory Network’s website. If you have a
question about whether a use falls under Fair Use or not, you can take
the Fair Use Evaluator on their site. There is also Fair Use chart at
Wheaton’s Buswell Library, that you can use as a quick guide to see if
your use of copyrighted materials is favoring or opposed to Fair
Use.”</p>
<p>The following is a screen capture of JAWS links list showing the
links on this page. You can see the three vague “click here” links
followed by the three descriptive text links. The later three are best
practice.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/JAWS_links_list.gif" class="clear" width="500"
height="384" alt="JAWS Links List Popup Window" /></p>
<p>It is best practice to also avoid linking URL text. It would be
better to write out where the link is taking the person. Imagine hearing
the following two links read out within a list of links by a screen
reader: <em>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2370354,00.asp</em>, or
<em>http://mashable.com/2010/10/13/bit-ly-qr-codes/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29#33L46KnrOkqk</em>.
The first link doesn’t give a clue to what the article is about, and the
second link is insanely long.</p>
<p>Blackboard’s content editor <strong>Insert/Edit Link</strong> button
will give you a screen in which you can add a <strong>Title</strong>
attribute to your link. Title attributes are additional advisory
information about where a link leads to or its purpose. It
<em>shouldn’t</em> duplicate the descriptive text link. Screen readers
may or may not be set to read the Title text. But, if you don’t want it
to show as missing on a web accessibility check, you can write Title
text either in the WYSIWYG view of  Blackboard’s content editor or
within the HTML Code View. For sighted users, when they mouse over the
link, the Title text shows as a tool tip.</p>
<p>Remember, the text you select to make a descriptive link is more
important that adding titles to links, for screen reader users.</p>
<p>We’ll take a look at how to add a link within Blackboard’s content
editor. Select the descriptive text you would like to turn into a link
by clicking and dragging over it. Click on the <strong>Insert/Edit
Link</strong> button in the second row of the content editor. It is the
eighth button from the left and has a chain link on it.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/wysiwyg_accessible_Bb_link_01.gif"
class="clear" width="800"
alt="Blackboard Learn&#39;s content editor with the Insert/edit link button outlined, and the descriptive text highlighted in the text entry box." /></p>
<p>In the next screen that pops-up, you would enter the URL of the web
page you would like to link to. You can also link to a file that is
already loaded in your course or upload a new file. For the Target, you
can choose to open it in the same window or in a new browser tab. If you
will be opening your links within new browser tabs, you can make a note
of this in your course information folder under the Accessibility
Resources section. The Title attribute below gives advisory information
(a tool tip) that the link will take the user to the Copyright Advisory
Network’s website.</p>

class="clear" width="800" height="308"
alt="Blackboard&#39;s Insert/edit link dialogue box, giving the option to enter the URL path, a Target window, and an advisory Title." /></p>
<p>Don’t bother setting the Class style. When you are done, click on the
<strong>Update</strong> button at the bottom.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-title">Building a Fluid Container for Content in
Blackboard</h2>
</div>
<div class="ugc chapter-ugc">
<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>Earlier we talked about using relative units such as em and % for
font size and image width to create content that scales when a user
changes her font size in her browser, or content that reflows when the
user changes the browser window size. This same principle applies to
HTML containers. In HTML, there is a generic type of container element,
called a Div, that we can use to surround our content. It has an opening
&lt;div&gt; tag before the content, and a closing &lt;/div&gt; tag at
the end of the content. When we specify a width in percent (%) for a
container, its content will reflow as a browser window is scaled down.
In the past, people used tables to layout just about everything on a web
page. While this works for sighted users, it causes problems for people
using screen readers. Using tables for layout should be reserved for
tabular data or information that has a two-way relationship, such as
found in rubrics or course schedules. Sometimes, tables can be used for
layout if the content within is read in a logical order. A screen reader
reads linearly, from top to bottom, line by line, in the order that
content appears in the HTML. This holds true for both the content in the
HTML code and content within a table. If the default language is read
from left to right, the screen reader also reads from left to right,
line by line, from top to bottom.</p>
<p>Below I’ll give you some code to create fluid content containers.
Their basic structure can be re-used and you can put your choice of
text, images or media within.</p>
<p>Single container with rounded corners</p>
<div
style="border-radius: 25px; background-color: #006a4d; color: #fff; padding: 1.5em; margin: 1.5em; font-size: 1 em; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
Here’s a single container with rounded corners in which you can write
whatever you would like. This box will respond to your screen size so
that the text reflows and remains visible without scrolling, until
Blackboard’s content area hits its minimum width of 1150 pixels. It
doesn’t use an image in its background, so it is light weight in terms
of downloading content. Its only limitation is set within Blackboard
Learn’s minimum width size for the parent element (the content area).
</div>
<p>The code that you would enter into the <strong>HTML Code
View</strong> is:</p>
<div style="border-radius: 25&lt;span class=;">
&lt;div style=”border-radius: 25 px; background-color: #006a4d; color: #
fff; padding: 1.5em; margin:1.5em; font-size: 1 em; font-weight: bold;
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;”&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a single
container with rounded corners in which you can write whatever you would
like.  This box will respond to your screen size so that the text
reflows and remains visible without scrolling, until Blackboard’s
content area hits its minimum width of 1150 pixels. It doesn’t use an
image in its background, so it is light weight in terms of downloading
content. Its only limitation is set within Blackboard Learn’s minimum
width size for the parent element (the content
area).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</div>
<div style="border-radius: 25&lt;span class=;">

</div>
<p>Note the words contained within the &lt;div&gt; element that display
in white letters. You can simply select this text, delete it or type
over it, and enter whatever message you would like to appear here. The
essentials to keep are: &lt;div style=”border-radius: 25px;
background-color: #006a4d; color: #fff; padding: 1.5em; margin:1.5em; 
font-size: 1 em; font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial, Helvetica,
sans-serif;”&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; . Write whatever you
would like in between the paragraph (&lt;p&gt;) tags.</p>
<p>The <em>style=”border-radius: 25px; background-color: #006a4d; color:
#fff; padding: 1.5em; margin:1.5em; font-size: 1 em; font-weight: bold;
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;”</em> is not HTML, but
“inline” CSS. CSS is another web language, that styles the content laid
out by HTML. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Most web designers
use separate (external) style sheets of CSS and link to them within
their web page. We have to use what is called “inline” CSS within a
content management system in order to impose the styling that we want
and override the basic styling set within the learning management
system’s CSS files.</p>
<p>Below, you can see a video of the contents within the container
reflowing as I scale the viewport size down.</p>
<div class="textbox interactive-content">
<span class="interactive-content__icon"></span>
<p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version
of the text. You can view it online here: <a

<p>If you would like to avoid the use of tables for layout, and save
them for tabular data that has a two-way relationship, then the
following code will help you create a fluid textwrap around an image. It
uses a &lt;div&gt; element, which a generic container for content in
HTML. You would click on the HTML Code View icon in Blackboard’s Content
Editor and paste the following into the HTML Code View dialogue box.</p>
<p>&lt;div style=”clear: both; width: 90%; float: left; display: block;
color: #000; padding: 2em; font-size: 1 em; font-weight: bold;
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;”&gt;&lt;img
src=”https://bb-csuohio.blackboard.com/bbcswebdav/pid-2171074-dt-content-rid-7398148_1/xid-7398148_1″
style=”float: left; margin: 0 1.5em; border: 1px solid black;”
width=”50%” height=”auto” alt=”” /&gt;This bar chart shows the
distribution of preferred learning styles of fifty-eight first and final
year nursing students in a study done by Flemming et al. The preferred
learning style of first and final year nursing students was Reflector.
The highest bar shows thirty three out of fifty-eight first year
students preferred Reflector learning style. Forty out of fifty-eight
final year students preferred Reflector learning style. Seven first year
students and eleven final year students preferred Activist learning
style. Eight first year students and five final year students preferred
Theorist learning style. Ten first year students and two final year
students preferred Pragmatist learning style.&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>This code for wrapping text around a larger image will look like the
following when displayed within Blackboard Learn:</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/Content_wrap_picToLeftOfText.png"
class="clear" width="904" height="318"
alt="text wrapping or positioned to the right of an image of a bar chart." /></p>
<p>You can go back into the WYSIWYG editor, select the bar chart image,
and then click on the <strong>Insert/Edit Image</strong> icon. You can
then browse your computer or course to find an image of your choosing.
Likewise, you can highlight the text and write over it by typing in your
own text. The code above provides an alternate way to layout your text
and images than using a table.</p>

<p>Adobe Reader is a free program for viewing documents that end with
.pdf. Adobe Reader does not have the full functionality of Acrobat
Professional, which is used to create accessible PDFs.</p>
<p>If you have a PDF you would like to use online, you can open it with
Adobe Reader to check for some accessibility features. If a PDF is
accessible, it will have tags and searchable text. Tags are the
structural elements, similar to HTML elements, that provide semantic
meaning to the content on the page. There are tags for headings,
paragraphs, images, lists, tables, and table headers for example. It is
these tags, much like Word Styles and properly marked up HTML, that help
people using assistive technology and devices navigate the page and
understand what content is.</p>
<p>You can check to see if the PDF has been tagged by opening the
document in Adobe Reader and going under the <strong>File</strong> menu,
selecting <strong>Properties</strong>. In the <strong>Document
Properties</strong> pop-up window, look for the word
“<strong>Yes</strong>” next to <strong>Tagged PDF</strong> at the bottom
of the screen. Please be aware, that even though a document may have
tags, they may not be semantically correct. Problems arise with
automatic tagging that produce the wrong tags, or wrong parenting order
and break the meaning that is conveyed visually. A common problem with
automatic tagging is the breaking up of one list into multiple lists.
Another is the addition of empty tags produced by spaces created by
using the return key multiple times within a Word document, before it
was converted to PDF.</p>
<p>To see if a document has searchable text, you can also check it
within Adobe Reader by pressing your <strong>CTRL</strong> key plus
“<strong>F</strong>.” Then in the “<strong>Find</strong>” search box
that pops up, type a word that you see in the PDF and click the
“<strong>Next</strong>” button. If the word becomes highlighted on the
page, then it has searchable text as opposed to being a scanned image of
text.</p>
<p>You can check for correct read order within an accessible, tagged PDF
or one that has had optical character recognition done on it by going
under the “<strong>View</strong>” menu and checking off “<strong>Read
Mode</strong>.” You then go under the “<strong>View</strong>” menu,
select “<strong>Read Out Loud</strong>,” and “<strong>Activate Read Out
Loud</strong>.” Go back under the <strong>“View”</strong> menu and
select “<strong>Read Out Loud</strong>,” and either “<strong>Read This
Page Only</strong>,” or “<strong>Read To End Of Document.</strong>” 
Listen to see if the order of presentation makes sense for meaning. Pay
attention to areas where diagrams with text have been inserted into
pages. The text within these gets converted to searchable text that can
be read, but often they get read in the middle of something else,
breaking logical read order.</p>
<p>Often, you will find “full text PDF” versions of publisher’s articles
on library databases. These articles have had optical character
recognition run on them, and have searchable text, but don’t necessarily
have correct read order, especially when figures or tables are inserted
within the body of the text, or there are multi-column layouts. These
are partially accessible, but better than a scanned image of an
article.</p>

<p>Often, you’ll find passages from books or articles in a journal that
you would like to make available to your students. Provided the usage
falls under Fair Use guidelines, these hard copies of the content can be
scanned on the 8<sup>th</sup> floor of the Michael Schwartz Library in
Electronic Course Reserves. Though, an office copy machine may scan to
PDF and do optical character recognition, these machines can’t do the
quality of scanning that the BookEye scanner can do in the Michael
Schwartz Library. Optical Character Recognition or OCR is the process of
recognizing images of letters in a document and converting them to
editable and searchable text. The BookEye scanner, with 600 dpi optical
resolution, produces a high quality scan that is optimized for the
optical character recognition process. It adjusts the baselines of the
text on the page to make sure they are straight and running at a 90
degree angle to the top of the page. It also prevents shadows from page
curvature at the seams. ECR has the ability to create accessible, tagged
PDFs, which can be used in your course.</p>

<p>Some would agree, the best things in life are free, like kittens, or
software that will do optical character recognition.</p>
<p>Most people have access to Microsoft Word. The most recent version,
in Office 365, will import a PDF and convert it to native Word format
for editing. You simply open the PDF in Word. There are some issues that
you may need to fix and PDF forms do not convert well. For more
information, see the tutorial on <a

in Microsoft Word</a> on envatotuts+ site.</p>
<p>If you don’t have Word and are still looking for a free way to
perform optical character recognition on a PDF document, you can also
try the OCR feature in Google Drive. It will convert files that are 2MB
or under and in PDF, JPG, GIF, or PNG formats. Anyone can get access to
a Google Drive by <a
href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&amp;flowEntry=SignUp"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a Gmail account</a>. After
uploading the PDF to Google Drive, you right click on it and select to
Open with Google Docs. The OCR process will take place. You’ll need to
format the text in Google Docs after that point. For more information

<p>Often, faculty will require students to read content on websites as a
learning activity. Sometimes these pages contain forms that students
interact with, such as registering with a professional organization.
When you find web pages or sites, you can check their accessibility to
get an idea of the problems that someone with a disability might
encounter. We’ll look at a way of doing this in this section. Please
don’t be afraid or turned off by the display of the code, if you’re not

<p>There are a variety of free web accessibility checkers available on
the web. They can give you an idea of how accessible a webpage is, if
you are requiring students or users to go there. I’ll provide a list of
free resources at the end of this lesson. We’ll focus on WAVE web
accessibility evaluation tool here.</p>
<p>WAVE, hosted by webaim.org, is available as a website and as an
extension for Chrome browser. The <a href="http://wave.webaim.org"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">WAVE web accessibility evaluation
tool</a> website is located at http://wave.webaim.org. Once on this
page, you can enter the url of a web page to check its accessibility.
The same tool exists in a form that will check the accessibility of
password protected or internal pages, as well as public web pages. For
this, install the <a
href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">WAVE extension for Chrome</a>. The WAVE
Chrome extension will also allow you to evaluate pages that use
JavaScript. JavaScript is stripped out of the page when displayed on the
WAVE website evaluator. There is more <a
href="http://wave.webaim.org/extension" target="_blank"
rel="noopener">information about WAVE Chrome Extension</a> at
http://wave.webaim.org/extension/.  Webaim has a help page that explains
<a href="http://wave.webaim.org/help" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how
to use WAVE</a> at http://wave.webaim.org/help.</p>
<p>WAVE checks for compliance with many WCAG 2.0 guidelines, but no
automated tool can check for all issues with the guidelines.</p>
<p>Once the analysis is run, WAVE presents a report on the top left side
of the screen as well as embeds icons and indicators within the web
page. You don’t need extensive knowledge about web accessibility to
benefit from the results. The RED icons indicate accessibility errors.
If you get red icons, it is likely that someone with a disability will
have difficulty accessing the content.</p>
<p>Below is a screen shot of a WAVE report for the internal landing page
for a personal account within our library’s system. This is a very clean
page with few errors and warnings. You can see the “W” icon within a
circle at the top left of the browser window. After I logged into my
account at our library, I clicked on the Wave “W” icon at the top to run
the web accessibility report. I’ve added red arrows to point out
embedded icons which WAVE added to the page. Red icons indicate problem
areas. Yellow icons indicate warnings. Green icons indicate
accessibility features (green icons) that may or may not be helpful to
someone using a screen reader.  The blue icons indicate structural
elements that have been included that can potentially help people using
a screen reader or other assistive technology, navigate your page more
efficiently.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/WAVE_markup.png" class="clear" width="930"
height="642" alt="WAVE active on a web page, showing alert icons" /></p>
<p>I’ll include a view of what the page looks like without the WAVE
embedded icons below:</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/webPage_beforeWAVEresults.gif" class="clear"
width="935" height="647"
alt="Web page before WAVE applied to it." /></p>
<p>When you click on the icons embedded in the web page, you get more
information about what each means. The top red icon with the white
bubble, for example, says that the language for the page isn’t
specified. Setting the language is important for screen readers to read
in the correct language. I’ve personally heard JAWS switch from reading
in English to reading in French once it ran into the word
“prerequisites” in a syllabus. The author never intended for this to
happen. If you are authoring an HTML page, you can set a language
attribute on the HTML tag at the top of the document. The code would
look like this for United States English:<br />
&lt;html lang=”en-us”&gt;.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/languageNotIndicated.png"
class="alignleft size-full wp-image-473" width="663" height="270"
alt="A popup window for WAVE&#39;s red chat bubble icon. It says, &quot;Document language missing. The language of the document is not identified.&quot;" /> <img
src="OEBPS/assets/h1_warning.jpg" class="clearRight" width="663"
height="270"
alt="The popup window for WAVE&#39;s yellow h1 icon. It says, &quot;Missing first level heading. A page does not have a first level heading.&quot;" /></p>
<p>The yellow “h1” warning icon to the right of the red icon states that
there is no heading level 1 for this page. It’s best to put a heading
level 1 at the top of a web page to tell what the main topic of the page
is. The visual headings on the page should be represented in the heading
tag structure on the page, in the correct hierarchical order. There
should be one h1 at the top of the page followed by heading level 2. Any
subheadings would be represented by h3 through h6.</p>
<h2>Form Labels As An Example of An Important Accessibility
Guideline</h2>
<p>Forms are vital to business and education. It’s impossible to get
through college without having to fill out forms online. Even within
courses students are asked to register with professional organizations,
or register online with services that check for plagiarism, such as
Turn-it-in.  If you are directing your students or users to fill out a
form, it’s important that each input item in the form be coded with an
“id” attribute that directly corresponds with a “for” attribute of a
form &lt;label&gt; element. <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H44.html#H44-tests"
target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCAG 2.0 techniques for <em>Using label
elements to associate text labels with forms</em></a> also tests for
visibility of the label for conformance. With explicit labeling, this
code looks like the following for a text entry box asking for a first
name:</p>
<p>&lt;label
<strong><em>for</em></strong>=”<label for="”&lt;span">firstname”&gt;First
Name:&lt;/label&gt;</label></p>
<p>&lt;input <em><strong>id</strong></em>=”firstname”  name=”firstName”
type=”text”&gt;</p>
<p>On the web page this displays like the image below.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/FirstName_form_InputTextEntry.gif"
class="clearRight" width="401" height="76"
alt="Visual display of a properly coded form text entry box with an explicit label &quot;First Name&quot; to the left of the box." /></p>
<p>With explicit labeling, the user can click on the text “First Name”
and the cursor will insert into the text entry box to the right of it,
which helps people with mobility impairments who may have trouble
clicking in small areas.  Not only do these labels increase the area for
a person with a mobility impairment to click on, in order to fill an
input element such as a text entry box, they also help screen reader
users know what they are supposed to be entering in a form input, such
as their first name or last name.  Fieldsets and legends are elements
that should be used on pages with multiple forms to help the person
filling out the forms distinguish between them. Fieldset tags group
related form items and legends provide a title or short description of
what the grouped form items are for, e.g. a home address. A good use of
this would be when there is a set of inputs for a mailing address and
another set of form inputs for a billing address.</p>
<p>Simply putting the text “First Name:” next to the text entry box is
not a reliable form of labeling. The same is true for forms that save
space by placing the label inside the form input, such as shown below.
Screen readers may read these, but there’s no explicit connection
between the labels and their inputs. Also, putting a form label inside
of a text entry box, is not good for users with cognitive issues that
include short term memory or attention. The label often disappears as
soon as the user clicks within the box. If the person forgets what was
needed for the input, she or he will have to back track out of the form
input to discover what it is. I know it is hard to imagine, for some of
us, what this is like. Keep in mind that we have a legal obligation to
make our programs accessible to them. Nielsen Norman Group has an
article about the <a
href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
title="Nielsen Norman Group&#39;s article about placeholder text in form fields">harmful
impacts of placeholders in form fields for usability, accessibility and
conversion</a>. Below is a screen shot of WAVE flagging form fields with
labels inside the text entry boxes.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/WAVE_showing_Missing_Form_Label.png"
class="clearRight" width="408" height="616"
alt="WAVE showing Missing Form Label icons for text entry boxes with internally written labels that disappear when you start typing in them." /></p>
<p>Leaving form labels as visible within the code is important for
passing accessibility checks.  In the WAVE analysis of the Scholar
search form above, WAVE and other accessibility auditing applications
yield an error for the form labels for the central search inputs. In a
couple cases, this is not due to form labels not being present in the
code, but because they aren’t <em>visible</em>. Their display is set to
“<em>none</em>.” Some screen readers will ignore content with styling
that sets the visibility to “<em>hidden</em>,” or the display to
“<em>none</em>.”</p>

box with a missing label</a></strong> </span></p>
<p>The image below shows the red and white warning tags next to the form
inputs that need visible form labels.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/WAVE_FormLabel_DisplaySetToNone-1024x283.gif"
class="clear" width="1024" height="283"
alt="Popup in WAVE showing missing form label for a label whose display style is set to none." /></p>
<p>The code for the inputs above looks like the following:<br />
<code>&lt;label for="searcharg" style="</code><strong><code>display:none</code></strong><code>;"&gt;Search Type&lt;/label&gt;</code><br />
&lt;input <strong>id=</strong>“searcharg<strong>“</strong>
name=”searcharg” size=”30″ onchange=”return searchtoolSubmitAction()”
maxlength=”75″ value=”” type=”text”&gt;</p>
<p>A way to get around the issue of hiding a label visually, but making
it available for screen reader users, is to use WAI ARIA. WAI ARIA is an
extension of HTML. An <em>aria-label</em> attribute can be added to an
input element to give it a label that is detected by assistive
technology. Important to note here, is that there is no added benefit
for people with mobility impairments, such as mouse users with tremors
or spastic hand movements, needing a larger clickable area. The code for
an aria-label would look like the following:</p>
<p>&lt;input type=”text” name=”search”
<strong>aria-label=”Search”</strong>&gt;<br />
&lt;button type=”submit”&gt; Search&lt;/button&gt;</p>
<p>In another instance of a label error, the code lacks a form label.
This is for the check box input next to the text, “Limit to items which
are not checked out.” In this case, there is no label element above the
input element. The code looks like the following:</p>
<p>&lt;div&gt;<br />
&lt;input name=”availlim” value=”1″
type=”checkbox”&gt;&lt;/input&gt;<br />
Limit to items which are not checked out<br />
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;</p>
<p>The following example shows problems with a form to join the American
Nursing Association, an organization Nursing students are asked to join.
The form lacks properly coded labels to associate form fields with their
text descriptions. The labels are present, but the form inputs don’t
have corresponding id attributes to associate them with their labels.
The yellow tag warning icons are next to the labels that have no
corresponding input, and the red tag error icons are next to the form
fields that aren’t marked up to associate them with their labels. The
ANA has a paper form that is meant to be printed and mailed in. It is an
untagged PDF, with no form elements, and therefore not accessible to the
blind and visually impaired. It’s best to look for sites that have
contact phone numbers with people that can help register a user who
can’t use their site. Alternatively, someone at CSU would need to help a
blind or visually impaired person complete a form.</p>

<p>WAVE extension for Chrome also has a tab at the upper left side to
turn off presentation Styles to see the structure of the page. This
button is called <strong>No Styles</strong><span class="mceItemHidden">.
When you click it, you’ll see navigation as lists, hopefully headings to
provide structure, as well as paragraphs of text. This structure is
similar to what a screen reader sees and reads out. If the structure
lacks lists for navigation, headings, or <span
class="mceItemHiddenSpellWord">fieldsets</span> with legends for
multiple forms, this can be a warning sign that the page will be have to
be read through from beginning to end by someone using a screen reader,
and will be more time consuming to navigate. Below is a screen shot of
what the form page above looks like with styles turned off.</span></p>

alt="The display of a web page with WAVE&#39;s &quot;No Styles&quot; tool activated. This shows the simple structure of the page that the screen reader will read off." /></p>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">WAVE also has a tab for checking color
contrast, called Contrast, at the upper left. When you click on this,
you’ll get warning icons for areas where the text doesn’t have a high
enough contrast ratio with its background to pass WCAG 2.0 standards.
The icons in red below, that have an ABC on them are areas with color
contrast problems. There’s no eye dropper tool to sample colors, so the
<span class="mceItemHiddenSpellWord">Paciello</span> groups <span
class="mceItemHiddenSpellWord">Colour</span> Contrast <span
class="mceItemHiddenSpellWord">Analyser</span> would be a much stronger
tool to use to find color and contrast issues, and find color
combinations that will pass WCAG 2.0 level AA.</span></p>

<p>Deque Labs developed an accessibility engine called <a
href="https://www.deque.com/axe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aXe
accessibility tools</a> to test accessibility of web pages. Axe exists
as an extension for Chrome and Firefox. I’ll focus on instructions for
adding it to Firefox, since WAVE only installs in Chrome browser.  You
can <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/?src=api"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
title="This link takes you to page to add aXe Developer Tools as a Firefox Add-On">install
aXe Developer Tools</a> to add an Accessibility Audit tool to Mozilla
Firefox’s Web Developer Tools. When this tool is active, it will allow
you to analyze a web page and see the accessibility issues in a panel
below the web page. When you are on a page you would like to check the
accessibility of, you can activate aXe’s Accessibility Audit. This is a
great tool if you not only want to identify the problem areas, but also
inspect the code of the page. If you prefer not to look at the code, you
are still made aware of the issues that will arise for people with
disabilities landing on the page you’ve chosen to share.</p>
<p>Below is a video overview of aXe Accessibility Audit tool, used with
its Highlight and Inspect features.</p>

<p>The aXe add-on for Firefox recently upgraded to version 3. It looks
like it will add to CSU’s mandated Firefox version 48, but there’s a
notice that it shouldn’t be used with an outdated version of Firefox. 
If you want to keep using Firefox browser and have a version of it that
will work with aXe Developer Tools, you can install <a
href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer" target="_blank"
rel="noopener"
title="Firefox Developer Edition to run with aXe add-on">Firefox
Developer Edition</a>.  The colors in the interface are different, but
you can search for the site you want much in the same way as with the
standard Firefox.</p>
<p>To search for aXe in Firefox, click the menu icon with the three
horizontal bars in the upper right corner. This type of icon is
typically referred to as a “hamburger” because it resembles a sandwich.
The arrow in the image below points to the menu icon.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/Firefox_hamburger_icon.gif" class="clearRight"
width="220" height="131"
alt="The hamburger icon in Firefox, or main menu, is located in the upper right corner and has three horizontal lines." /></p>
<p>Once open, click on Add-ons.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/Firefox_Add_On_Menu.gif" class="clearRight"
width="498" height="815" alt="The Add Ons menu option in Firefox" /></p>
<p>In the next screen, click on Extensions and type “aXe” in the Search
box at the upper right.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/aXe_Extension_Search-1024x346.gif"
class="clear" width="1024" height="346"
alt="Firefox&#39;s Extensions screen with aXe typed in the Search input field." /></p>
<p>When aXe comes up at the top of the search results, click on it. On
the page with the details about aXe, click the Add to Firefox
button.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/aXe_Add_to_Firefox_button-1024x887.gif"
class="clear" width="1024" height="887"
alt="aXe Extension details page with the Add to Firefox button" /></p>
<p>Once aXe is added to Firefox, you can access it under the web
developer tools. These tools are opened by clicking the wrench icon at
the top right of the browser, or going to the hamburger menu and
selecting Web Developer and then Toggle Tools. See the method for
accessing the web developer tools under the wrench icon below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/aXe_wrench_menu-1024x630.gif" class="clear"
width="1024" height="630"
alt="With the wrench icon selected, which accesses Firefox&#39;s Web Developer Tools, select Toggle Tools option." /></p>
<p>Enter the URL for the page you would like to analyze for
accessibility. I’ll go to the updated version of the American Nursing
Association’s membership form. The Developer Tools will likely open at
the bottom of the browser window or on the right side. Below is an image
of the tools open at the bottom of the screen. You will also need to
navigate to the aXe tab or view of the developer tools. Once there,
click the Analyze button.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/aXe_analyze_button-1024x608.gif" class="clear"
width="1024" height="608"
alt="aXe open at bottom of Firefox, and Analyze button visible and clickable." /></p>
<p>The analysis results will come up at the bottom of the window. On the
left are a list of problem items on the page. In the middle are details
about the issue, such as a problem with text being too light against the
background color and not creating enough contrast to meet the WCAG 2.0
AA standard. When the Highlight button is clicked on, the item will have
an outline around it, which helps people with sight recognize what it is
on the page. This will help non-coders to see what the problem is, along
with the written description of the problem. The end user can arrow
through all of the items on the page with the same issue, e.g. not
enough color contrast between text and background, using the arrows at
the far right of the aXe screen. To look at different issues, click the
next item down in the list on the left, e.g. documents must have a
title.</p>

class="clear" width="1024" height="614"
alt="aXe analysis results showing a list of problem items on the left, and details about the currently selected problem in the middle." /></p>
<p>On the right, you’ll see information about how to fix the problem and
how critical the impact is. With the color contrast problem below, we
see that its impact is serious. We’re told that the light gray text has
a contrast of 2.32 to 1 against the background color. We’re told that we
need to raise the contrast to a ratio of 4.5:1.</p>

<h2>Use a Web Developer Extension in Firefox to Disable all CSS Styles
and Turn Off all Images</h2>
<p><a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer" target="_blank"
rel="noopener"
title="This link takes you to a page to download the Web Developer extension for Firefox by Chris Pederick.">Web
Developer add-on for Firefox by Chris Pederick</a> is also a good
extension that will allow you to turn off all CSS styles and see the
structure of the page. This structure is what a screen reader will
detect and read back. This extension for Firefox will also allow you to
turn off all images, to check for alternative text which the screen
reader will read back. <a href="http://webaim.org/resources/webdev"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
title="WebAIM&#39;s page explaining how to use the Disable feature of Mozilla Firefox&#39;s Web Developer tool to check for accessibility issues.">WebAIM’s
page on how you can use the Disable feature of the Web Developer
extension to check for accessibility</a> is at
http://webaim.org/resources/webdev/.</p>
<h2>HTML Based Text Enlargement and Reflow</h2>
<p>Because people with low vision will increase their default browser
font size, text should be formatted with relative font size units such
as em, or %. Content should also respond to a reduced window size and
the user’s set font-size by reflowing in a logical order, and not
clipping content. You can check this by entering <strong>Responsive
Design Mode</strong> with Mozilla Firefox’s <strong>Web
Developer</strong> tool under the <strong>Tools</strong> menu and then
dragging the lower right corner of the browser window to the left and
upward. The page content, including the text shouldn’t just scale down
or shrink to fill the reduced viewport window. Text size should remain
readable, which typically involves the text becoming slightly larger,
but it could possibly stay the same size.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to check page response to a reduced window size in
Chrome browser. You do this by first clicking on the middle
“<strong>Restore Down</strong>” icon at the top right of the screen that
looks like a window frame over the top of another window frame. Then,
hover your mouse over the lower right corner of the browser window until
it becomes a diagonal arrow. Click and drag the lower right corner up
and to the left. The text should reflow and possibly change font
size. If the developer used CSS media queries to layout the page, the
font size may increase when the window approaches the size of a phone or
small tablet. This would be an example of a best practice.</p>
<h2>Look at the Page Info</h2>
<p>A user can look at a web page’s info within Mozilla Firefox browser
by right clicking on a web page and selecting <strong>View Page
Info</strong>. This is a quick way to see what information is coded into
the meta elements within the head of a web page. These meta tags give
information about the page that help screen reader users know what it is
about when they find the page within Google results or on Social Media.
A properly marked up page will have a unique title at the top of the
<strong>General</strong> tab.  A meta “description” is particularly
helpful and shows highlighted in blue in the image below. The image
below is a screen capture of the page information for The Ohio State
University’s home page. It has a unique title at the top that says, “The
Ohio State University.” The “og” tags provide information to FaceBook
users when the page is shared on Facebook.  The “twitter” tags provide a
title, description, and an image for a Twitter Card when the page is
shared on Twitter.</p>

summary of findings are listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>98.6% of students find captions helpful</li>
<li>71% of students without hearing difficulties use captions at least
some of the time</li>
<li>66% of ESL students find captions “very” or “extremely” helpful</li>
<li>52% of students use captions as a learning aid to improve
comprehension</li>
<li>15% of students didn’t know how to tell if a video had captions</li>
<li>The most common reason students use captions is to help them
focus</li>
<li>The most common reason students use transcripts is as study
