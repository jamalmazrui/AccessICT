The Ministry of Children and Equality is responsible for promoting equality and preventing discrimination on the basis of gender, age, sexual orientation, skin colour, ethnicity, religion or disability. Through this action plan for universal design and increased accessibility, the government is bringing both the equality policy and sustainability policy an important step further.
For people with a disability, accessibility is an important factor in their ability to take part in society. A lack of accessibility has a discriminatory effect. 
The Government's work is based on universal design. Universal design is an expression of a value put on equality by society. Basing social developments on universal design provides better and more equal surroundings for people with a disability. It also results in social qualities that are positive for the entire population and for Norway as a society.
Universal design also contributes to social and economic sustainability and is therefore part of the national sustainability strategy.
This is a plan that affects most areas of society. All the ministries are involved in implementing the plan.  A wide range of tools is to be used to reach all levels of the public sector and help to develop the private sector.  This work will be coordinated with the National Transport Plan 2010-2019.
The government's vision is for Norway to be universally designed by 2025.  This is ambitious but possible. The action plan shows how the government will lay the foundation for achieving this ambition through various goals and measures that are subject to deadlines.

1 Introduction 
The goal of increased accessibility in society has high priority. The Soria Moria Declaration states that the parties in power will prepare an action plan concerning the accessibility of transport, buildings, information and other important areas of society. The Declaration also states that a binding timetable for accessibility also has to be ensured and that the principle of universal design is to form the basis for the government's work.
The government wants to get away from a way of thinking in which the individual is defined as the problem and in which special measures for people with disabilities are the main solution. The universal design of the physical environment means an equal form of accessibility, so that the main solution can be used by as many people as possible. This applies not only to people with disabilities but also, for example, to families with children in pushchairs and to the elderly. The government will make systematic efforts to promote knowledge and stipulate a requirement of universal design in the development of the human-created environment.
The UN Convention on the Rights of People with disabilities was adopted by the UN General 


During the past few years, several Acts and regulations have been amended in order to ensure universal design and increased accessibility. These include: 
 
• The Planning and Building Act
• The Universities and University Colleges Act
• The Vocational Training College Education Act
• The County College Act
• The Primary and Secondary Schools  Education Act 
• The Public Procurement Act
• Education-sector legislation
• Regulations concerning a framework plan for kindergartens' contents and tasks
• Regulations concerning the universal design of the transport sector.
• Regulations concerning impact assessments
• Regulations concerning basic loans from the Norwegian Housing Bank
Assembly on 13 December 2006. The Convention's objective is to ensure that people with disabilities have a full and equal right to realise their human rights. 
The Convention stipulates that the countries are obliged to implement the necessary measures to ensure that people with disabilities have access to the physical environment, transport, information, communication and other areas and services that are open or offered to the general public. The countries must also make efforts to promote universal design. Norway signed the Convention on 30 March 2007. The government is now preparing a parliamentary bill concerning the ratification of the Convention. In May 2009, 51 countries, seven of which were European, had ratified the Convention. The UN human rights conventions form a wide-ranging foundation for ensuring the rights of all people with disabilities, irrespective of their age, gender, sexual orientation or ethnic background.
In January 2009, a new, aggressive Act relating to a prohibition against discrimination on the grounds of disability (the Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act) came into force. The new Act's objectives are to strengthen the legal protection against discrimination on the grounds of disability and to prevent discrimination due, among other things, to a lack of accessibility. The Act stipulates a duty to universally design undertakings that offer goods or services to the general public. Public and private undertakings that offer goods or services to the general public also have a duty to make active efforts to ensure universal design. In addition, employers, both public and private, must make active efforts to promote equality and ensure equal opportunities and rights, regardless of functional impairment. 
The government has appointed a public commission to prepare a proposal regarding compiled, more integrated and strengthened anti-discrimination legislation in Norway (the Anti-Discrimination Legislation Commission). The Commission is to prepare and submit a proposal regarding a compiled Act to combat discrimination and consider how rules regarding accessibility and adaptation for people with disabilities can be safeguarded in the Act. The Anti-Discrimination Legislation Commission is to submit its recommendations by 1 July 2009.
The government has also initiated an inquiry into people with disabilities' access to goods, services and information. This inquiry is to be completed by 1 July 2009. Any proposals to strengthen the protection against discrimination in these areas will be included in the follow-up to the Anti-Discrimination Legislation Commission's recommendations. 
The Norwegian parliament (Storting) has agreed to the government's proposed new Planning and Building Act. This Act contains new provisions regarding universal design, including in its statement of legislative purpose. This will strengthen the implementation of universal design in the field of local authority planning and new building. The Act also authorises the issuance of regulations to upgrade categories of existing buildings, facilities and outdoor areas to universal design within further stipulated deadlines. Regulations to further support and stipulate the consideration of universal design in both the Act's planning part and building part are in the process of being developed. 

Norway cooperates internationally and follows up a number of recommendations and obligations in the area of universal design and increased accessibility, including:
UN
•	The UN Convention on the Rights of People with disabilities.
Council of Europe
• Resolution: Introduction of universal education in all courses. 
• Resolution: Full participation through universal design.
• The Council of Europe's action plan for people with disabilities 2006-2015.
EU
• Regulations concerning technical standards for means of transport.
• The EU Disability Action Plan 2004-2010.
Nordic Council of Ministers
•	Cooperation forums with a focus on Design for everyone/Universal design within the various sector areas.
Better legislation is one of several instruments for combating discrimination in the form of a lack of universal design. Administrative measures, improving expertise and economic instruments are also important in order to prevent future barriers and remove existing ones. 
In March 2009, the government introduced a 
White Paper concerning the National Transport Plan 2010-2019. This White Paper underlines that everyone has an equal right to participate in society. The opportunity to move around in society easily, efficiently and safely is crucial for being able to participate in working life and social activities. The government will therefore develop and adapt the transport system so that as many people as possible are ensured good mobility and that individual special solutions are avoided in so far as possible. During the period covered by the plan, the government will increase the use of resources considerably in order to pave the way for the universal design of the transport systems. 
White Paper (Stortingsmelding) no. 17 (20062007) An Information Society for Everyone places particular emphasis on three prerequisites for the government's work on digital inclusion: digital access, universal design and digital competence.
Norway's strategy for sustainable development created in 2008 places emphasis on the fact that universal design, in the form of workplaces being better adapted for people with disabilities, will reduce exclusion from working life. It is important to increase the number of people with disabilities who are in work. Increased participation in working life would improve their economic standard of living. The universal design of public transport, buildings and ICT increases their chances of education and work.
Accessibility for people with disabilities has improved over the past few years. Developments vary within the different areas of society. Two surveys that have assessed the status of the work on universal design and accessibility are: "Full participation for all, Trends 2001-2006",published by the Norwegian Directorate of Health and the National Centre for Documentation on Disability, and the "Status Report 2007 - Social Developments for People with Disabilities", published by the National Centre for Documentation on Disability.
The first report shows that a number of the proposals in Official Norwegian Report (NOU) 2001:22 From User to Citizen have either been implemented or are being considered. The report shows that there have been improvements in accessibility and universal design in the areas of buildings, outdoor areas, transport and ICT as regards more attention being paid, better regulations and higher levels of activity.
The report also shows that there is some way left to go before the overall goal of a society for everyone has been reached. People with disabilities do not have the same access to important areas of society as the rest of the population. The greatest challenges are linked to making the existing surroundings universally designed. Later analyses and cost estimates confirm the extent of the challenges. 
A report entitled "The Status of Accessibility in 
Norway" was published by the Norwegian State Council on Disability and the National Centre for Documentation on Disability in 2006. It concluded that there is limited knowledge in Norway of accessibility and universal design in important areas such as ICT, transport, buildings and outdoor areas.
In the work on this action plan, emphasis has been placed on the provisional results of the external evaluation of "The Government's Action Plan to ensure Increased Accessibility for People with Disabilities. A plan to ensure universal design in important areas of society" (2005-2008). The evaluation, which is being conducted by the Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research (NIBR), shows that the ministries' sector responsibilities, use of stimulating measures and development of accessibility and universal design norms have been important contributions to the work of ensuring universal design.
Norwegian status reports and international comparisons indicate that Norway has come a long way in its legislation in a number of areas, and has implemented universal design relatively well in its public administration sector. These are central qualities for resolving the challenges which remain and a good foundation for the further work. The government therefore believes it is possible to achieve the vision of a universally designed society by 2025. 
The development of the action plan's strategy and content has taken place in consultation with relevant ministries and through several processes that have requested the views of government departments, regional administrative authorities, research institutions, the Norwegian State Council on Disability, municipal and county council committees dealing with people with disabilities, interest groups and professional organisations.
2. National goals and strategies for universal design and increased accessibility
2.1. The plan's main goals
The action plan is intended to support the implementation of the new Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act, new Planning and Building Act and other new legislation dealing with universal design. The action plan is also intended to help meet Norway's obligations when Norway ratifies the UN Convention on the Rights of People with disabilities.
2.2. Implementation of universal design that is subject to deadlines prior to 2025 
The government's vision that Norway is to be universally designed by 2025 can be achieved using various instruments that are adapted to suit the various sectors and tasks. Goals that are subject to deadlines are used. 
In some areas, such as in ICT, there are statutory requirements regarding when universal design is to have been implemented. In other areas, the deadline is set when the universal design regulations are implemented. 
It is an important principle in the government's strategy that the main solution for all new procurements, buildings and facilities intended for the general public is to be universally designed. Plans are also to be based on the principles of universal design. This is assured through such things as legislation and guidelines and the efficient follow-up of these. 
In important areas, such as existing buildings and outdoor areas, both the extent and cost of upgrading to universal design are uncertain. In addition, the responsibility has been divided among a number of different bodies and owners. A survey conducted by the Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research (NIBR) shows that it will be very expensive to upgrade existing buildings, facilities and outdoor areas intended for the general public's use.  Due to the major financial cost of upgrading existing buildings, facilities and outdoor areas to universal design, a step-by-step and prioritised approach has been adopted. The Planning and Building Act includes the authority to issue regulations regarding upgrades to a standard that is equivalent to universal design. Over time, requirements as to existing building categories can be stipulated in separate regulations. The individual regulations will determine the deadline for implementing the upgrade.
Other surveys and analyses, however, show that the additional costs are limited if the upgrade to universal design takes place through planned maintenance and repair work. The government places emphasis on utilising these opportunities.

Goals subject to deadlines 
• Based on the Planning and Building Act, regulations may be issued concerning the upgrading of categories of buildings, facilities and outdoor areas for the general public by stated deadlines.
• Existing buildings that are managed by Statsbygg are to be successively upgraded in accordance with Statsbygg's action plan. The measure is to continue until the universal design requirements have been met in accordance with the vision, ie, by the end of 2025. 
• Relevant underlying state departments are to prepare action plans for universal design by 2011.
• All local authorities should have adopted a municipal plan containing universal design guidelines by 2015.
• Universal design should be an integral principle in all regional plans by 2015.
• All county councils and 25% of the local authorities should actively participate in a national development project aimed at the local authorities and counties by 2014. 
• All local authorities should have actively taken part in the guidance concerning the new Planning and Building Act by 2010. 
• Norwegian State Railways (NSB) has entered into a contract for the delivery of 50 new train sets that meet the universal design requirements. These train sets will come into operation in 2012.
• Older railway materials that will be in use after 2010/2011 will be upgraded to as high an accessibility level as possible.
• On the main road network, almost 100 intersections and around 2,000 out of a total of 6,500 bus stops will be upgraded to the desired standard by 2019.
• For the railways, achieving accessibility at very many stations and the universal design of the busiest junctions will be given priority. The Public Roads Administration and National Rail Administration are, in dialogue with the user organisations, to prepare specific action plans that stipulate which of the bus stops and stations are to be prioritised and the measures that are to be implemented.  
• All new ICT intended for the general public's use is to be universally designed as from 2011.
• All existing ICT intended for the general public's use is to be universally designed as from 2021.Good documentation showing the development and effect of various instruments is important to reach the universal design goals that have been determined. In order to obtain a better basis for prioritising the efforts from now until 2025, universal design indicators are being developed in key areas. The data on which the indicators are based is being incorporated in so far as possible into existing registers, such as KOSTRA (the Municipality-State Reporting) and Matrikkelen (the Land Register).
In addition, emphasis is placed on obtaining more detailed statistics and data in order to ensure precise planning in the individual sectors. Statsbygg's registration system and the Norwegian Public Roads Administration's bus stop register are examples of this. 
Several specific part-goals relating to the vision of universal design by 2025 will be set for more areas as basic material regarding the status gradually becomes available.   
2.3 Strategy
2.3.1 An integrated and cross-sectoral effort
The action plan is sector overarching and contains both cross-sectoral and sectoral measures.
Cooperation between various administrative stages and levels is important. For this reason, the action plan contains a programme to support the local authorities' work. This programme has been developed in dialogue with the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities (KS) and is based, among other things, on experience gained from the "Universal Design as a Municipal Strategy" development project that was carried out by the Ministry of the Environment together with 17 local authorities from 2005-2008. 
County councils and county governors are to be involved more heavily in the regional and local work on universal design.     
Strengthen the sector responsibility principle The sector responsibility principle is a necessary and fundamental strategy for achieving the main goals of the policy concerning people with disabilities. The strategy involves it being the normal bodies in society that are to provide and finance the services offered to people with disabilities in the same way as to the rest of the population. It is the same bodies that, as required, are to provide additional special schemes if the ordinary schemes are not sufficient.
The individual ministry is to review its area of responsibility and assess the need for additional deadlines and specific measures. Relevant underlying departments are to prepare action plans for universal design by 2011. This work is also to be linked to the duty to carry out activities that has been stipulated in the Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act. 
Increased contribution and cooperation In order for the plan to be implemented efficiently and well, there must be close cooperation between the ministries affected.
Emphasis will be placed on a close dialogue with the Norwegian State Council on Disability, interest groups for people with disabilities and professional organisations.
The Ministry of Children and Equality is responsible for administering the "Act relating to councils or other representation schemes for people with disabilities, etc, in local authorities and county councils". These councils have, among other things, tasks in relation to universal design and accessibility within the local authority and county council's activities.  The government's action plan for universal design and accessibility includes ways of supporting the councils' work, such as through measures to enhance competence. Information that the ministry obtained from the county governors in 2008 shows that 87% of the local authorities have established councils or some other form of representation. The ministry has implemented measures to achieve councils for people with disabilities throughout Norway.
The Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities (KS) will be involved in discussions of matters relating to the municipal sector. 2.3.2 Use of legal instruments 
The use of legal means forms an important part of the overall strategy for promoting universal design. A new foundation has been laid through the new Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act. This Act provides legal protection against discrimination on the grounds of disability in all areas of society. The Act contains a discrimination part and an accessibility part, in addition to rules concerning a duty to be active.
The universal design obligation in the Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act is a minimum requirement and has been introduced at the same time as a legal standard. A legal standard is a concept that has legal consequences but whose content is determined on the basis of norms that may change over time, for example in line with technological developments. 
The duty to have universal design applies to public and private undertakings that offer goods or services to the general public. A breach of this duty is to be regarded as discrimination unless the duty entails a undue burden. When assessing whether or not a burden is undue, emphasis is to be placed on the adaptation's effect on the dismantling of disabling barriers, whether the undertaking's normal function is of a public nature, the necessary costs of the adaptation, the undertaking's resources, security considerations and safety considerations.
Equality and universal design have been strengthened in several Acts, including the new Planning and Building Act. A further strengthening in existing sector legislation is continuously 

The government's action plan for universal design and increased accessibility covers measures in 16 ministries' areas of responsibility. Key measures for achieving universal design and equality for people with disabilities have been included in and are described in greater detail in action plans and strategies for the individual areas. 
These include: 
• The National Transport Plan 20102019 (Ministry of Transport and Communications),
• The National Sustainability Strategy (Ministry of Finance).
• Action Plan for Architecture Policy (Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs)
• Environmental Action Plan for the Housing and Construction Sector 2009-2012 (Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development)
• Action Plan for Local Air Quality (Ministry of the Environment)
• Asthma/allergy Strategy (Ministry of Health and Care Services).
• New Action Plan for Habilitation and Rehabilitation (Ministry of Health and Care Services).
• The Government's Consumer Policy - Action Programme 2008-2009 (Ministry of Children and Equality).
• Outdoor Life for People with Disabilities 
(Directorate for Nature Management)
• Universal Design of Cultural Monuments 
(Directorate for Cultural Heritage)
• Nordic Regional Policy Cooperation Programme 2009-2012 (Nordic Council of Ministers/ Ministry of the Environment).being considered. The government intends to determine national policy guidelines for universal design for local authority planning. 
2.3.3. Use of non-legal instruments
The state has considerable instruments at its disposal in its efforts to achieve the vision of Norway being universally designed by 2025. The government will make use of its public market powers and its administrative powers, including its management of the departments and power to allocate funding (including through annual budgets), as key instruments in the action plan. This means, for instance, the active use of opportunities inherent in the public procurement regulations in order to ensure the universal design of procurements and that universal design is safeguarded in all parts of public administration, to stipulate clear universal design guidelines in relevant public grants and to utilise and intensify the public authorities' opportunities to ensure universal design through relevant approval and subsidy schemes.
2.3.4 Further details concerning the use of economic instruments
The main principle is that financing is to take place within the ordinary budget frameworks and that universal design is to be naturally included in the various sectors' relevant projects.
The government introduced parliamentary bill (Stortingsproposisjon) no. 37 (2008-2009) Regarding Amendments to the National Budget for 2009 with employment measures on 26 January 2009. In the bill, the government proposed several measures, including in the local authority sector, that will promote universal design. The package of measures also contains funds earmarked for universal design and accessibility in several sectors. This package of measures has been agreed to by the Norwegian parliament (Storting).
On 13 March 2009, the government introduced a 
White Paper on the National Transport Plan 20102019. This White Paper sets aside NOK 4.47 billion for universal design and measures to improve accessibility in the transport sector. Around 78% has been set aside for measures relating to the railway network, while 22% has been proposed used on measures relating to the road network. All new infrastructure must also be designed in accordance with the principle of universal design. 
NOK 18.6 million has been set aside for following up this action plan - parliamentary bill (Stortingsproposisjon) no. 1 (2008-2009). These funds will to a great extent be directed towards cross-sectoral and highly prioritised measures such as competence enhancement, local authority measures and the development of universal design indicators.
2.3.5 Focus on four prioritised areas of commitment
The government is prioritising four areas of commitment in its action plan for universal design and accessibility. These are outdoor areas/planning, buildings, transport and ICT. Increasing the levels of employment among people with disabilities is a consideration for all the measures in the plan. This agrees with the need stated in status reports on this area and recommendations made during the phase when ideas were invited for the action plan.
Within these areas, prioritisations will be made in relation to the dates of the measures, such as the building categories that are to be upgraded and the order in which existing building categories, facilities and outdoor areas are to be upgraded to universal design.
In addition, the government wants to make some cross-sectoral perspectives visible. These are the local authority commitment, development of indicators and standards, public transport policy, interests of children and young people, and research and development.
The efforts in the four prioritised areas of commitment will help to make it easier for people with disabilities to work. Instruments other than universal design will be important for achieving this. The state personnel policy is to require at least one qualified applicant with a disability to be called in for an interview. The Ministry of Government Administration and Reform will, in dialogue with relevant knowledgeable and interested parties, consider measures that can increase the recruitment of people with disabilities to state jobs. The ministry will also map how the qualification principle is practised and ensure that expertise is developed in the Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (Difi).

The government's financial policy package of measures relating to employment  
In the parliamentary bill, the government proposed a non-recurring grant of NOK 4 billion as an earmarked subsidy to the local authority sector for the maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading of the local authority infrastructure. This grant is divided into NOK 3 200 million for the local authorities and NOK 800 million for the county councils (80/20 per cent distribution), with an equal amount per inhabitant.
The grant is to be spent on measures relating to the maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading of local  authority infrastructure, including buildings. Apart from normal maintenance measures and catching up with maintenance that has lagged behind, the grant may, for example, be spent on indoor-climate, environmental and energy measures and on the universal design of local authority buildings.
The government stated that all new buildings on which work is started as a result of the measures proposed in the parliamentary bill (Stortingsproposisjon no. 37 (2008-2009)), including local authority and county council buildings, are to have an emphasis on universal design.  
In the parliamentary bill, the government proposed increasing the grant for operating and maintaining the railway network by NOK 818 million. Of this, the aim is to spend NOK 758 million on increased maintenance of the railway network. The maintenance measures will result in railway traffic being more regular and punctual. In addition, the measures will improve safety, increase accessibility and result in better information to the public. The government also proposes spending NOK 483 million on railway line investments, of which NOK 50 million will be spent on railway stations and junction developments to make stations and platforms in the railway network more accessible.   The government has also proposed granting:
• NOK 35 million for adaptation measures in outdoor areas where measures for people with disabilities (universal design) are prioritised.
• NOK 25 million to the Directorate for Cultural Heritage to repair and adapt cultural monuments with an emphasis on universal design
• NOK 20 million earmarked for accessibility measures linked to Statsbygg's real estate.
• NOK 30 million for modifying asylum centres in order, among other things, to make them suitable for people with disabilities.
• An additional NOK 75 million as a non-recurring grant for the building of student accommodation in 2009, linked to environmental and energy measures and universal design.
The government's financial policy package of measures relating to employment has been agreed to by the Norwegian parliament (Storting).

3. Measures in the four  prioritised areas
3.1. Building and construction
3.1.1 Goals 
One of the main goals of the government's housing and building policy is to have more environmentally friendly and universally designed housing and buildings in attractive sites. The work goal is to increase the number of universally designed homes, buildings and outdoor areas. In line with the government's vision, all buildings that house state-owned civilian operations should be universally designed. This relates to public areas, workplaces and associated outdoor areas. Goals subject to a deadline
• Pursuant to the Planning and Building Act, regulations may be issued concerning the upgrading of categories of buildings, facilities and outdoor areas intended for the general public within given deadlines.
• Existing buildings managed by Statsbygg are to be upgraded successively in accordance with Statsbygg's action plan. The measure is to be continued until the universal design requirements have been met in line with the vision, ie, by the end of 2025.
3.1.2 Strategies and completed and on-going measures
There are currently limited national statistics showing the accessibility of outdoor environments, buildings and facilities. 
The population and housing census in 2001 showed that around 7% of all homes are both accessible and suitable as homes for wheelchair users. Around 22% of those who are 80 years old or more live in homes that are accessible to wheelchair users. 
Data is available regarding the accessibility quality of homes financed through the Housing Bank's mortgage and grant schemes. More than half of the 6 216 homes that were granted a Housing Bank basic mortgage to erect or improve a home in 2007 met the requirements as to universal design qualities. 
Measures have been implemented to improve the knowledge of how accessible buildings and outdoor areas are. The Housing Bank and the National Office of Building Technology and Administration are taking part in the work of developing universal design indicators for buildings. This work will in time lead to a better statistical overview of the status of the universal design of housing, buildings and outdoor areas.
In addition, universal design is being encouraged in the housing and construction sector through the Housing Bank's financial instruments, through legal instruments in the Planning and Building Act and the regulations issued pursuant to it, and through the systematic increase in the level of information and expertise among key players and consumers in general. 
The new Planning and Building Act proposes tightening up the building design requirements. 
Universal design is required in new measures relating to buildings, facilities and outdoor areas intended for use by the general public.  An important element here is that a requirement of universal design will be stipulated for buildings in which people work. This will increase the opportunities for being able to start work and continue to work with a disability.
This tightening up will be implemented in the technical regulations issued pursuant to the Planning and Building Act.
This action plan contains a number of measures intended to help support the implementation of the new Act.
The management of the state buildings is divided among many ministries, but a lot of the state-owned real estate in the private sector is managed by Statsbygg. Statsbygg is subject to the Ministry of Government Administration and Reform. 
In total, Statsbygg manages around 2.3 million m2 of building floor space, divided among more than 1,500 properties in Norway, including Svalbard, and around 115 abroad. As from 1 January 2009, the real estate increased by around 313,000 m2 in that the prison properties managed by the Norwegian Correctional Services were transferred to Statsbygg.
During the period from 2004-2005, Statsbygg extensively registered the accessibility of its public buildings. The information is registered in the "Building for everyone" database, which also has a management module and a general public module. 1.6 million m2 and 577 buildings are registered in the database, along with reports on repair measures, accessibility and pictures.
Since 2005, Statsbygg has set aside a share of its maintenance funds for measures to ensure universal design in existing buildings. During the first few years, around 2% of the maintenance funds were spent on universal design measures. Since 2007, the efforts have been increased, in line with the goal of the new action plan, and a minimum of 6% of the maintenance funds are now spent on universal design measures each year. In total during the 2005-2008 period, just under NOK 76 million was spent on the universal design of the buildings managed by Statsbygg.  At the beginning of 2009, the remaining need for improvement is estimated to cost around NOK 400 million. The need for improvement is based on the recommendations stated in the "Building for Everyone" guide published by the National Office of Building Technology and Administration and the Housing Bank. The need will have to be reassessed when the revised Planning and Building Act has been adopted and new regulations come into force. 
The Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs finances facilities for sports and other physical activities through gaming funds. Accessibility for people with disabilities and universal design are incorporated into the criteria for the award of these funds. The Ministry will further develop and strengthen this work.
Existing church buildings represent a challenge with regard to universal design. It is the local authorities and church councils that are financially responsible for building, operating and maintaining churches, and the Ministry may not instruct them.  Through the interest-compensation scheme for repairing church buildings, the state has made conditions suitable for churches to be secured and preserved. Universal design is one of the measures covered by the scheme. 
School buildings are owned and run by local authorities, county councils and the state. The Ministry of Education and Research is responsible for the school sector and is responsible for the interest-compensation scheme for school buildings that can, among other things, be used for universal design. The work of the driving force unit at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) includes preparing and coordinating action plans for universal design in universities and university colleges. 
There are 225 buildings at Norway's embassies, consulates and missions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Statsbygg play a key role in the construction of new buildings and upgrading of existing ones.
Universal design is relevant for some of the 
Armed Forces' buildings. The Norwegian Defence 
Estates Agency is the builder and manages the Armed Forces' buildings. On-going plans and measures relating to universal design will be continued. 
The universal design requirements will be safeguarded for new buildings in the legal sector. Examples of new projects are Halden Prison and Gulating Court of Appeal. The upgrading of existing prisons in accordance with universal design is one of several factors in a plan for upgrading existing prisons. A plan for implementing adaptations for the hearing impaired in courts has been prepared and will be maintained.
There is a considerable amount of real estate in the health sector. As regards existing buildings and premises, the initiative is being taken to ensure universal design. The Ministry of Health and Care Services has the overall responsibility for this. According to the Labour and Welfare Administration Act, the Labour and Welfare Service (NAV) offices must, in so far as possible, be designed based on the principle of universal design. The Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion will contribute to the physical design of the NAV offices meeting these requirements. 
There are 51 women's refuges, two centres for rape victims and 20 centres for incest victims in Norway. The Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth and Family Affairs (Bufdir) is responsible for administering the state subsidies to women's refuges and rape and incest centres. The circular stating the guidelines for state subsidies to women's refuges and centres for rape victims makes it clear that the women's refuges must be suitable for all relevant user groups, including women with disabilities.
3.1.3 Measures
Measure B1 The New Planning and Building Act and new regulations issued pursuant to it are intended to help ensure universal design in new buildings, facilities and outdoor areas.  This measure ensures that universal design will be a general consideration in the new Planning and Building Act through the new statement of legislative purpose. In addition, the responsibility for following up the accessibility requirements in  building matters is made clear.  The local authority's duty to supervise compliance with the accessibility requirement in building matters is also made clear.  Tighter requirements are introduced as to lifts in new work buildings, new public buildings intended for use by the general public and new multi-dwelling buildings. 
Implementation: as from 2010
Responsible: Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development
Measure B2 The Planning and Building Act authorises the issuance of regulations concerning the upgrading of existing buildings, facilities and outdoor areas. The new Planning and Building Act contains a provision authorising the introduction of regulations concerning the upgrading of buildings, facilities and outdoor areas intended for use by the general public. Over time, requirements as to existing building categories may be determined in separate regulations. A step-by-step and prioritised approach is to be taken.
Implementation: The individual regulations will stipulate the deadline for the upgrade Responsible: Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development
Measure B3 The Universal Design in the Building Sector Information Programme

A new accessibility and universal design guide for physical activity is to be prepared. This will be based on the new Planning and Building Act, the new Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act and accessibility criteria applicable to sports and physical activity facilities. New standards for sports facilities will be prepared, with particular emphasis on accessibility and universal design. These standards will be prepared in cooperation with Standards Norway.
Implementation: As from 2009
Ansvarlig: Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs
Measure B6 Interest-compensation scheme for the repair of churches The interest-compensation scheme was introduced in 2005 with the aim of encouraging the securing and preservation of churches, church decorations and church contents. The scheme is administered by the Housing Bank, and universal design and adaptation are one of the measures covered by the scheme. The investment framework has been increased by NOK 800 million in the National Budget for 2009, and by a further NOK 400 million in the government's package of measures. The total investment framework from which interest compensation may be sought equals NOK 1.2 billion in 2009. Of the country's just over 1 620 churches, a total of 376, divided among 184 local authorities, have been awarded interest compensation since the scheme was introduced in 2005.
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs
Measure B7 Universal design of school buildings
This measure includes an investment scheme for school buildings and swimming pools. The interest-compensation scheme for rehabilitation work and new buildings was renewed in the budget for 2009. The aim is to have a total investment framework of NOK 15 billion over an eight-year period. The investment framework for 2009 is NOK 3 billion. 
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: Ministry of Education and Research
Measure B8 Universal design of the embassies, consulates and missions. This measure includes guidelines stating that universal design is to form the basis of new buildings and the choice of premises for Norwegian embassies, consulates and missions. In addition, an action plan for the universal design of the embassies, consulates and missions is to be prepared.
A simple overview of the universal design status of the embassies, consulates and missions is available. The universal design standard of all the buildings and their outdoor areas will be mapped during the first half of 2009. Following this, a progress plan for improvement to universal design standard will be prepared.
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: Ministry of Foreign Affairs/ Statsbygg
Measure B9 Universal design of the Norwegian 
Armed Forces' buildings
There must be an awareness of universal design when planning and building the Armed Forces' construction projects. The Norwegian Defence Estates Agency must therefore consider universal design in connection with all new construction projects.  
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: Ministry of Defence
Measure B10 Universal design of prisons and courts 
This measure means that universal design requirements will be complied with for new buildings in the justice sector. The universal design requirements will also form part of a plan for upgrading existing prisons.  A plan to improve court rooms for the hearing impaired will be maintained.
Implementation: As from 2009 
Responsible: Ministry of Justice and the Police
Measure B11 Universal design of buildings in the health service and social welfare service The Ministry of Health and Care Services will take the initiative to ensure that regional health authorities prepare universal design plans. The Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion will follow up the duty to have universal design at the Labour and Welfare Service offices.
Implementation: As from 2010
Responsible: Ministry of Health and Care Services and Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion
Measure B12 Universal design of new state purpose-built buildings This measure means that the ministries responsible for the development ensure that the universal design requirements stipulated in the new technical regulations issued pursuant to the amended Planning and Building Act (the building application part) are met in new buildings. As the builder, Statsbygg is assigned an active role as a professional body and driving force to ensure that universal design requirements are met in the planning and building process.  
Implementation: As from 2009 Responsible: The ministries that are responsible for the development and the Ministry of Government Administration and Reform
Measure B13 Universal design of existing buildings managed by Statsbygg
Existing buildings are to be upgraded successively in accordance with Statsbygg's action plan. Statsbygg sets aside an amount for the universal design measure each year. This measure will continue until the universal design requirements have been met in line with the vision, ie, by the end of 2025.
Implementation: Continuation of measures determined in 2005
Responsible: Ministry of Government Administration and Reform
Measure B14 Universal design of buildings rented by state undertakings
When state civilian undertakings enter into leases concerning location in private buildings, or renegotiate existing leases, the lease should state that the building will be upgraded in accordance with universal design requirements by 2025. According to section 9 of the Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act, it is the tenant that is responsible for the premises being universally designed. The state tenant should ensure that any defects are mapped and rectified. The ministries have overall responsibility for the mapping and implementation of universal design within their areas of operation.
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: All ministries
Measure B15 Cultural monuments and universal design

Responsible: Ministry of the Environment
Measure B16 Women's refuges, centres for rape victims and centres for incest victims In order to reach the goal of making these emergency centres accessible and adapted to all users, the Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth and Family Affairs (Bufdir) has, in cooperation with the Housing Bank, turned to the emergency centres to encourage the increased use of the Housing Bank's lending schemes in order to improve accessibility. The circular containing guidelines on state subsidies to the centres for incest victims also stipulates that the centres are to provide good services to users with special needs too, including being accessible to people with disabilities. 
Implementation: Continuously
Responsible: Ministry of Children and Equality
3.2. Planning and outdoor areas 
3.2.1 Goals
Universal design is a main goal of the Ministry of the Environment's operations and is to be incorporated into the state's planning policy guidelines. The considerations pursuant to the new Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act are to be included. The local authorities should make efforts to ensure that all municipal centres in Norway are universally designed and that all local authorities have outdoor areas for general use that are universally designed. 
Goals subject to deadlines
• All local authorities should have adopted a municipal plan containing universal design guidelines by 2015.
• Universal design should be an integral principle of all regional plans by 2015.
• All county councils and 25% of all the local authorities should actively take part in a national development project with efforts aimed at municipalities and counties by 2014. 
• All local authorities should have actively taken part in guidance on the new Planning and Building Act by 2010.
3.2.2 Strategies and completed and ongoing measures
The Ministry of the Environment coordinated the 2005-2008 Government Action Plan to ensure increased accessibility through universal design, in cooperation with the ministries and many other bodies. A programme involving 17 local authorities spread throughout the country was established.
These pilot local authorities have become pioneer municipalities for universal design in Norway. Their experiences have been included in Report T-1472 "Universal Design as a Local Authority Strategy". A new action plan implements a new generation of pilot programmes aimed at the regional level, involving county governors and county councils.  Former pilot local authorities will be included as resource municipalities. These efforts will form an important part of the work of making Norway universally designed by 2025, in accordance with the government's vision.
The local authority programme is intended to show that universal design has been included in the new Planning and Building Act as a strategy for helping to make society accessible to all and to avoid discrimination. Universal design is to form the basis of all planning. The term "Outdoor areas" describes many purposes for areas, all of which are further defined in the Act's planning regulations.  The planning will thus promote the design and adaptation of physical factors that provide equal opportunities for taking part in society. This entails an innovative approach to planning and design and an ambition to constantly find better and more inclusive solutions. 
The dismantling of disabling barriers is in so far as possible to take place through ordinary, general measures that form part of the planning work. Universal design is to be operationalised in both local authority plans and development plans. 
The provisions and guidelines relating to the universal design of outdoor areas can be linked to all the sub-objectives of the following area objectives: "Buildings and Facilities", "Green Structures" and "Transport Facilities and Technical Infrastructure". All outdoor areas, whether for recreational or transport use, are to be planned so that they are accessible to everyone and have universally designed areas in which people can rest or carry out activities.  This applies both to new areas and when redesigning existing ones. 
The planning work is to be carried out by the local authorities, county councils and private players and have an effect on the design of outdoor areas and the individual building measure. The results therefore depend on many parties cooperating. Experience gained from administering the AntiDiscrimination Act and Gender Equality Act is to be included in these contexts.  
The Ministry of the Environment will concretise its sector responsibility for universal design in the areas dealing with the preservation of cultural monuments, outdoor life, air pollution and localised information too through individual measures and programmes. Public departments, local authorities and regions will be involved and guided in their work on universal design. The local authority centres contain buildings, undertakings and outdoor areas that are to be publicly accessible through their function of a public or private nature. Here, coordination with measures in other ministries' areas is required.  
3.2.3 Measures
Measure P1 Strengthen universal design in local authority and regional planning This will take place through guidance and competence measures in connection with the introduction of the new Planning and Building Act. A programme is to be established focusing on universal design in the local authority centres.
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: Ministry of the Environment
Measure P2 Geographical information system for obtaining and presenting universal design data 
This measure comprises the development of geographical information systems relating to universal design which include the mapping and gathering of accessibility data for buildings and outdoor areas. The systems are to be used to measure the status and development of universal design at a national level, local authority level and user level.
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: Ministry of the Environment
Measure P3 Outdoor areas and local air quality 
This measure comprises the following up of goals and measures in the report entitled "Outdoor Life for People with Disabilities", which has been prepared by the Directorate for Nature Management. This includes universal design in the management of state-protected outdoor areas and in subsidy schemes for outdoor life purposes. The measure also includes the preparation of an action plan for local air quality that takes account of persons with asthma/allergies.
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: Ministry of the Environment
Measure P4 Universal design in area-development projects
The Housing Bank is to have a focus on universal design in area-development projects in which the undertaking is involved.
Implementation: As from 2009 
Responsible: Ministry of Local Government and 
Regional Development 
Measure P5 Health in planning The measure comprises innovation and the development of methods. The tools are the Planning and Building Act and local authority plan, and the methods that are to be developed relate to how various public health objectives, including universal design, can be realised through being anchored in the local authority plan's society part, area part and subject plans. Organisation, cooperation, political anchoring, the development of expertise and dissemination of information are also means to be used in this context.  The Health in Planning scheme, which is run by the Directorate of Health, will be continued.
Implementation: As from 2009 
Responsible: Ministry of Health and Care Services
3.3 Transport
3.3.1 Goals
The main goal is to have a universally designed transport system - one that, in so far as possible, can be used by everyone without any need for adaptation or special arrangements. The intermediate goal for the plan period is that the public transport system is to be more universally designed. No combined assessment of the state of the Norwegian public transport network exists. Basically, it must be assumed there is a need for upgrading to universal design at all bus stops and stations in the public transport network, as well as at ferry quays. In addition to the actual bus stop or station, it is important that the access to the public transport system is also universally designed. This entails a need for targeted efforts over a long period. The achievement of the goals in relation to the government's vision of universal design by 2025 must be assessed when the plan is reviewed.
Goals subject to deadlines
• NSB AS (Norwegian State Railways) has entered into a contract for the delivery of 50 new train sets that meet the universal design requirements. These train sets are to be put into operation in 2012. 
• Older train materials that will be in use after 2010/2011 will be upgraded to as high an accessibility level as possible. 
• Regulations concerning the universal design of rolling stock on railways, including tram lines, underground railways and commuter trains, will be issued in 2009.
• Scheduled town buses that are registered after 2004 are to be universally designed. 
• The aim is to issue regulations concerning the universal design of commuter and express buses (motor vehicles in licensed transport), etc, by the end of 2009.
• The transport departments are to develop routines for inspecting the universal design of facilities that are being planned and of completed facilities.
• On the main road network, almost 100 intersections and around 1,500-2,000 out of a total of 6,500 bus stops will be upgraded to the desired standard by 2019.
• The Public Roads Administration and National Rail Administration will in 2009 prepare an action plan for the National Transport Plan 2010-2019. This will put into concrete terms the government's measures in the work to achieve a universally designed public transport system.
The government will contribute to the public transport system becoming more universally designed both through bodies of legislation and agreements and through physical measures financed over the national budget.
3.3.2 Strategies and implemented and ongoing measures
The travel chain
An accessible transport system requires there to be accessibility in every part of the travel chain.
The travel chain comprises information on transport alternatives, the journey to/from, and any stops at stations and bus stops. In addition, there is the accessibility of the means of transport itself. A breach in the travel chain means that one or more elements of the travel chain are not accessible. When parts of a journey are inaccessible, the entire journey may appear to be inaccessible.
In the public transport system, the travel chain has many parts, many players and a spread distribution of responsibilities. In order to ensure that the entire travel chain is safeguarded, the various players' efforts must be coordinated.
Responsibilities and coordination
The distribution of responsibility in the public transport area requires a high level of cooperation between the players. In order to ensure that the entire travel chain is safeguarded, the players' efforts must be coordinated. The Public Roads Administration will be a driving force in this regional coordination work. It will take the initiative to implement common projects and packages of measures in cooperation with the National Rail Administration, county councils, regions and local authorities. The prioritisation of the funds for the common projects will take place in close cooperation with local authorities. The Ministry of Transport and Communications will prioritise measures that will help to improve entire travel chains in the town areas.
As part of the Ministry's work of improving the accessibility of the public transport system, around NOK 50 million has been awarded to a separate subsidy scheme each year since 2006. According to this scheme, county councils and local authorities can apply for funding for measures that support state accessibility measures within their own area of responsibility. The objective of the scheme is to contribute to quicker and more coordinated efforts on the part of all players. The intention is for this scheme to continue during the plan period.
Means of transport
Scheduled town buses that are registered after 2004 must meet requirements concerning accessibility to buses for people with disabilities. The requirements are particularly aimed at the needs of those with mobility difficulties, but requirements are also stipulated regarding equipment and technical solutions. The intention is for regulations concerning the universal design of commuter and express buses (motor vehicles carrying out licensed transport), etc, to be issued in 2009. 
NSB (Norwegian State Railways) currently has a total of around 14 different main types or variants of main types of rolling stock in operation. Most of the renewal will take place through the acquisition of new rolling stock. NSB has entered into a contract for 50 new train sets that meet the universal design requirements to be delivered starting in 2012.  The new rolling stock that NSB AS has ordered will be equipped with a small step that can be pushed out to reduce the horizontal distance. 
Older rolling stock that will be in use after 2010/2011 will be upgraded to as high a level of accessibility as possible. 
The requirements concerning the new train sets have been prepared in cooperation with the user organisations for people with disabilities. The same requirements have been incorporated into proposed new regulations to be issued pursuant to the Railways Act. The regulations are to apply to all carriage of persons by rail in Norway, including trams and underground and commuter trains. The aim is to issue the regulations regarding this in 2009.
The requirements of accessibility and adaptation for people with mobility difficulties on ships were implemented in 2004. The Norwegian Maritime Directorate has also issued regulations concerning the universal design requirement on passenger ships sailing in Norwegian waters, and these apply to the access to the ship, communication and notifications, alarm systems and movement within the ship. 
The requirement of accessibility on main road ferry links will be introduced gradually as the individual link is put out to tender. New vessels that start to sail on links that are subject to tender must be universally designed. Existing vessels that start to sail on links that are subject to tender are subject to requirements that certain adaptations are to be made to the ship. The Public Roads Administration is also working on stipulating universal design requirements for existing vessels in so far as this is technically and financially possible.
Railways
There are around 360 railway stations with passenger traffic in use in Norway today. Stations, stops, areas for the public and facilities at the railway stations are of varying standard and in various conditions. Many older stations have too short, too low or too narrow platforms. For persons with mobility difficulties, different platform heights at the stops and varying distances between the platform and the train are particularly great obstacles. Considerable investments in the infrastructure will be required to achieve satisfactory accessibility for passenger traffic.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications has asked the National Rail Administration to prepare a long-term plan for the development of the railway with the aim of achieving universal design.  This means that the principles of universal design are to form the basis of planning, designing and building new station infrastructure. The National Rail Administration's plan for upgrading existing stations is based on long-term efforts, with the aim of upgrading firstly to accessibility for everyone (at least one access route to the platform is to be available), and secondly to full universal design. The efforts will primarily be made where the measures will affect as many travellers as possible so that the benefit will be greatest.
The trend towards a universally designed train service depends, among other things, on the harmonisation of the platform height and height of the interior train floor. The National Rail Administration and NSB have jointly agreed on a platform height standard, so that NSB was able to base its orders for new rolling stock on this in 2008. The benefit from raising the platforms to 76cm in height will thus be achieved as the new train sets are phased in.
Roads
The upgrading of intersections, terminals, bus stops and stopping places is the responsibility of the owner of the road. Around 6,500 bus stops on the trunk road network are owned by the state, while 60,000 stopping places and bus stops are on roads owned by county councils and local authorities. For 2008, the Public Roads Administration budget for repairing bus stops along the main road network was around NOK 100 million. The intention is to maintain this level. A decision regarding and the financing of the upgrading of these bus stops must be made and financed by local authorities and county councils.
 
Airports
Avinor has prepared a quality plan for the entire air journey. This states needs and measures at the airports. The universal design requirements apply to both new facilities and the modification of existing facilities. Avinor believes the current level of accessibility to be satisfactory at most of its airports. However, there are still challenges at several airports, linked to the various elements in the travel chain from arrival at the airport until the passenger goes on board the aircraft. 
Harbours
The public harbours currently on the whole have services that are adapted to suit most user groups. The design of the passenger terminals in harbours is regulated by the Planning and Building Act. The requirements as to the universal design of new facilities and changes to existing ones can thus be prioritised in the local authorities' plans.
Adapted transport
As part of the public transport service, the county councils are responsible for providing transport that is adapted to people with disabilities (the TT scheme). The Ministry of Transport and Communications has issued advisory guidelines. The scheme is available to people who cannot use ordinary public transport. There is wide variation in the county councils' schemes. This reflects differing political priorities, dissimilarities in the public transport systems and varying geographical factors.
The government has established trial projects in several counties to develop the demand-responsive transport scheme, ie, demand-controlled public transport, in which individual journeys are coordinated. At the same time, adjustments have been made to the TT scheme (transport adapted to people with disabilities) regulations so that as many as possible of today's TT users can use the ordinary public transport system, including demand-responsive transport schemes and service routes that are open to everyone. The government will consider whether it is expedient to supplement such a scheme with trials of special measures aimed at younger, active TT users. 
Passenger rights
In 2008, the Ministry of Transport and Communications issued new regulations pursuant to the Aviation Act concerning the rights of people with disabilities and persons with mobility difficulties in relation to air transport. The goal is to ensure the rights of aircraft passengers so that no one can be refused permission to fly on the grounds of their reduced mobility or disability.  The Ministry of Transport and Communications has also determined a national minimum standard for assistance services at all Norwegian airports, prepared in cooperation with representatives of the user organisations. 
The aim is to establish corresponding provisions regarding passengers' rights and obligations when travelling by rail, including a requirement of access to assistance and compensation for the loss of or damage to aids for people with disabilities. 
3.3.3 Measures
Measure T1 Integrate universal design into the body of plans
Universal design is to become an integral part of all plans for the upgrading and building of infrastructure that is to be planned and built by the Public Roads Administrations, Avinor or the National Rail Administration. The organisations representing the interests of people with disabilities are to be entitled to comment on development projects which include an area for the public.  
During the period, the departments are to develop routines to ensure that this consideration is safeguarded. 
In addition, the departments are to develop routines for inspecting the universal design of facilities that are being planned or have been completed. 
Implementation: Continuously
Responsible: Ministry of Transport and Communications
Measure T2 Information
There is to be a greater focus on the information provided at stations, bus stops and intersections/ junctions. Easily available, correct and unambiguous information on when trains are running is important, especially in deviating situations. The information is to be provided in such a way that it can be understood regardless of the type of disability, ie, it must meet the universal design requirements.  
The development and establishment of a national travel planner which allows the traveller to plan a journey with enough knowledge of the accessibility conditions in every part of the travel chain is an important measure on which work will be carried out. 
Implementation: Continuous
Responsible: Ministry of Transport and 
Communications

Measure T3 Government purchase of passenger train services 
NSB has entered into a contract regarding the delivery of 50 new train sets that meet the universal design requirements. The new train sets are to be put into operation in 2012. The rolling stock will be equipped with induction loops and information equipment for blind and sight-impaired people. The requirements have been prepared in cooperation with the organisations representing people with disabilities. Old rolling stock that will be in use after 2010/2011 will be upgraded to as high an accessibility level as possible.  
Implementation: Continuous
Responsible: Ministry of Transport and Communications
Measure T4 Development of the transport services for people with disabilities demand-responsive transport and the TT scheme Trial projects have been established in several counties in which the demand-responsive transport system, ie, demand-controlled public transport, is developed in a way that involves individual journeys being coordinated. At the same time, the TT scheme's regulations are being adapted so that as many as possible of the current TT scheme users can use ordinary public transport, including demand-responsive transport and service routes that are open to everyone. A total of NOK 10.85 million was allocated for 2009. So far, the plan is for the trials to take place for three years. The trials will then be evaluated before a decision on whether to follow them up further is made. 
Implementation: 2009- 2011 
Responsible: Ministry of Transport and Communications
Measure T5 The continuous travel chain - responsibility, coordination 
In order to ensure that the entire travel chain is safeguarded, the various players' efforts must be coordinated. 
The Public Roads Administration will be a driving force in this regional coordination work and will take the initiative to introduce common projects and packages of measures in cooperation with the National Rail Administration, county councils, regions and local authorities.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications will prioritise measures that contribute to local agreements which make sure entire travel chains in the town areas can be improved. 
The aim is to continue with the subsidy scheme according to which county councils and local authorities can apply for funding for measures that support state accessibility measures in their own area of responsibility.
Implementation: Continuous 
Responsible: Ministry of Transport and 
Communications
3.4. ICT 
3.4.1 Main goal
The government's main goal for its ICT policy in general is to have an information society that is for everyone, cf White Paper (Stortingsmelding) no. 17 (2006-2007). Norway is one of the foremost countries in the world when it comes to the access to and use of ICT. The fact that large parts of society use digital solutions means that the consequences of being excluded are greater, and this particularly applies to the elderly and people with disabilities.
Goals subject to deadlines
• All new ICT intended for the general public is to be universally designed as from 2011.
• All existing ICT intended for the general public is to be universally designed by 2021.
3.4.2 Strategies and completed and on-going measures
As a follow-up to White Paper (Stortingsmelding) no. 17 (2006-2007) "An information society for everyone", the requirement of the universal design of ICT was incorporated into the AntiDiscrimination and Accessibility Act and agreed to by the Norwegian parliament in 2008.  The Ministry of Government Administration and Reform has been looking into the questions 
of which solutions are to be included and who is to be responsible for the various solutions since the first quarter of 2009. In addition, the instruments that are to be in place when the Act comes into force and the method of organisation of and responsibilities linked to supervision, enforcement, complaints, etc, must be clarified. Information material will also be prepared and information meetings and suchlike will be held.
The Act comes into force on 1 July 2011 for new ICT and 1 January 2021 for existing ICT. Since the requirements will have to be established one year before the entry into force, standards/guidelines for the key ICT solutions must be established by 1 July 2010.  That means that regulations and the basis for the regulations must be issued by the same deadline. As regards which ICT solutions are to be covered, these are primarily new ICT solutions that support the undertaking's normal functions and which are also main solutions aimed at or made available to the general public. Work on indicators will also be started.
The Ministry of Government Administration and Reform funded certifying training in the universal design of ICT in 2008. Through participation in the EU's Competitiveness and Innovation Programme 2007-2013, the ministry has contributed to the work on the international standardisation of universal design. This work involves planning the design of broad European standards for universally designed ICT that can be linked to procurement requirements and other legislation through normal national standardisation bodies.
The Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (DIFI) is a driving force for the improved quality and accessibility of the information and services offered on the Internet. The Agency is also to contribute to online public information and services becoming better and more easily accessible to the general population.
Difi assigns a seal of approval to public websites (state and local authority) as regards accessibility and quality. Around 700 public websites are evaluated annually according to 36 criteria relating to accessibility, usage quality and content. The evaluations assess the status and put the focus on issues and areas that public administration bodies and websites have a particular responsibility for following up. The result of the quality evaluations is presented on the Norge.no website, and the individual website is awarded stars according to the total number of points it achieves. The 2008 results show that progress has been made compared to the year before. 
IT Funk is a cross-boundary project linked to people with disabilities, universal design and new technology. The project is connected to the Research Council of Norway and is part-financed by a NOK 5.6 million grant from the Ministry of Children and Equality each year. The goal of this project has been to contribute to greater accessibility to information and communication technology for people with disabilities in that it must be possible for everyone to use ICT-based products and services that are introduced to the general market. Over several years, this project has developed a unique working model involving close collaboration between industry, R&D environments, user organisations and public bodies. In 2007, it was decided to continue the IT Funk project for another six years. 
3.4.3 Measures
Measure IKT1 Main project to clarify universal design in ICT
This measure comprises mapping what is to be procured, who is responsible and how supervision is organised and the preparation of regulations, information material, etc. The measure is linked to the Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act. The sum of NOK 5.5 million has been set aside to implement this measure. 
Implementation: As from 2009 Responsible: Ministry of Government Administration and Reform
Measure IKT2 Universal design on the Internet The newly established Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (DIFI) is to be a driving force for the improved quality and accessibility of online information and services.
Implementation: As from 2009 Responsible: Ministry of Government Administration and Reform
Measure IKT3 Evaluation of digital learning platforms
Ensure that digital learning platforms in schools meet the needs of users with disabilities.
Implementation: 2009
Responsible: Ministry of Education and Research
Measure IKT4 Greater adaptation of TV broadcasts and cinema films for persons who are deaf or hearing impaired.
It will be considered whether general requirements regarding subtitling and sign-language interpretation should be stipulated for the television sector, etc. Grants for subtitling Norwegian cinema films for the hearing impaired have been taken over by FILM&KINO as from 2009. Over the next few years, the digitisation of cinemas will lead to physical subtitling becoming far cheaper and the distribution of subtitled films being simpler. In the digital future, it will be considered whether copies of Norwegian films which are given a production grant are to include an opportunity to be shown with subtitles. The process of converting to digital cinema will take place from 2009-2014. A production grant requirement that all Norwegian films must be subtitled is being considered. 
Implementation: 2009-2014
Responsible: Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs
Measure IKT5 Development of speech recognition technology
The possibility of developing speech recognition technology for the Norwegian language is being examined. 
Implementation: 2009-2013
Responsible: Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs
3.5 Sector-overarching measures
The prioritised focus areas in the action plan for universal design and accessibility are extensive. The local authority sector is particularly important. At the same time, there are several common features. A number of cross-sectoral schemes and supplementary issues therefore form part of the action plan. This applies, among other things, to the creation of indicators and standards, the state communication policy, the interests of children and young people, and research and investigation. 3.5.1 Local authority efforts
The local authorities' management and work are crucial to the development and implementation of universal design. This applies to all the prioritised areas in the action plan. Norway's 430 local authorities have a decisive influence on the design of buildings and outdoor areas and are important players in the fields of passenger transport and the adaptation of ICT and workplaces.
Great emphasis is therefore placed on preparing good regulations that the local authorities can apply in order to achieve universal design in the various sectors.  In addition, extensive programmes and measures are being implemented in order to give the local authorities expertise and resources for this work. 
A number of ministries, departments and organisations are involved in this. The county governor offices have been given the task of monitoring developments and local authority and county council boards have been given a stronger mandate to contribute to the local authority planning and decision-making processes. 
The government has started to cooperate with the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities (KS) in order to ensure good communication, a broad area of coverage and suitable instruments. 
The local authority efforts will to a great extent be aimed at the regional level, with county governors and county councils as coordinating players.  The programme is intended to make it clear that universal design has been included in the new Planning and Building Act as a strategy to help make society accessible to everyone and help prevent discrimination. 
Key measures in the local authority measures are:
Measure K1 National development project in county councils and local authorities Universal design is to be developed as a strategy in local authority and regional planning and administration. The measure includes local authorities that can act as a resource, pilot county councils and new pilot local authorities.  All the county councils and 25% of the local authorities should be actively involved by 2015. 
Implementation: 2009-2013
Responsible: Ministry of the Environment
Measure K2 Programme of cooperation with the Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities (KS) regarding measures in the local authority sector This cooperation includes the development of expertise, dissemination of information and coordination of programmes and efforts in which universal design is relevant. 
Implementation: 2009-2013 
Responsible: Ministry of Children and Equality, et al
Measure K3 The Planning and Building Act authorises the issuance of regulations concerning the upgrading of existing buildings, facilities and outdoor areas. The new Planning and Building Act contains a provision authorising the introduction of regulations concerning the upgrading of buildings, facilities and outdoor areas for use by the general public. Over time, requirements as to existing buildings, facilities and outdoor areas may be stipulated in separate regulations. A step-by-step and prioritised approach will be taken. The State is presumed to cover the costs. 
Implementation: The individual regulations will stipulate the deadline for the upgrade. Responsible: Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development
Measure K4 Contribute to regional development and innovation funds being able to be spent on investments and planning in accordance with universal design
Implementation: 2009-2013 
Responsible: Ministry of Local Government and 
Regional Development 
Measure K5 Programme to improve the 
expertise of politicians and local authority employees
The programme is to offer universal design expertise in the Planning and Building Act area to local authority employees and politicians.  A number of bodies are collaborating on this, including the National Office of Building Technology and Administration, Housing Bank, Delta Centre (National Resource Centre for Participation and 
Accessibility for People with Disabilities), Ministry of the Environment and Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities (KS).
Implementation: 2009-2013 
Responsible: Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development 
Measure K6 Make arrangements so that polling stations and voting opportunities are universally designed/accessible to people with disabilities for the parliamentary elections in 2009. The design of polling stations is a local authority responsibility and must be in accordance with the election legislation and election regulations. The Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development will, through information measures aimed at the local authority sector, help to ensure that arrangements are made so that polling stations and voting opportunities are universally designed/accessible to people with disabilities for the parliamentary elections in 2009.
Implementation: 2009 
Responsible: Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development
3.5.2 Development of indicators and standards
The development of indicators and standards involves a number of ministries, government departments and professional environments. The work is coordinated by a steering group containing representatives of relevant ministries.  A network forum led by the Delta Centre (National Resource Centre for Participation and Accessibility for People with Disabilities), with the participation of directorates, government departments, user organisations and professional institutions, will coordinate the practical work. 
The indicators are developed by the departments in the individual sectors and apply to buildings and facilities, outdoor areas, transport and ICT. Emphasis is placed on utilising existing data collection and analysis registers such as KOSTRA, Matrikkelen (Land Register) and Norway Digital. In addition, separate data collections are being considered in order to map the accessibility and universal design of such things as sports and physical activity facilities.
A number of ministries and directorates are making efforts to develop or finance the development of universal design standards in their areas of responsibility. Standards Norway is an important body in this work. There are standards on such things as the accessibility of websites and travel destinations and the care and operation of parks and landscape preservation areas.  Universal design standards for buildings, outdoor areas, travel chains and public procurements are currently being prepared. International cooperation and coordination are important parts of this process. 
Consumers must have easy access to information on goods and services. The right to consumer, product and environmental information applies to everyone, including those who are blind or sight-impaired and people with other functional impairments. Standardisation in the area of goods and services is important. The Ministry of Children and Equality is responsible for the State's consumer policy.
Measure IS1 Establishment of an indicator system to measure universal design
An indicator system for the universal design of ICT, transport, buildings, facilities and outdoor areas is being established. A plan stating when the indicators are to be in operation will be presented in 2009.  
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: Ministry of Children and Equality
Measure IS2 Development of universal design standards 
Universal design standards are being developed. Important areas are buildings, outdoor areas, transport and ICT.
Implementation: As from 2009 Responsible: Ministry of Children and Equality, etc
Measure IS3 Incorporate systematic universal design into the standardisation work from the consumer side.
A project with the aim of mapping specifications relating to the accessibility and universal design of services in various areas will be started. The mapping is to be followed up by concrete standardisation work relating to goods and services.  
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: Ministry of Children and Equality 
3.5.3 The communication policy 
The State information policy provides the outer frameworks for how state departments are to communicate with the general public, voluntary organisations, industry and other public undertakings. 
The goal of the information policy includes both democratic considerations and efficiency considerations, in that information and communication are to be used as an instrument for achieving political goals. 
The individual state undertaking must, within the information policy frameworks and on the basis of its own distinctive character, chisel out its own local information policy and strategy.
The State information policy is to be replaced by the State communication policy. The goal is for the new policy to put a stronger spotlight on the fact that the entire population is to be included when state undertakings communicate with the general public. This is based on five principles: openness, participation, reach everyone, active and integrated. Comments are being invited on a draft of the State communication policy in 2009. Important measures in the draft of the new communication policy are:  
Measure KOM1 A State communication policy with greater emphasis on the fact that the entire population is to be included. Rules and norms for universal design are to form the basis of state undertakings' communication work. It is to be taken into account that people have different needs and prerequisites for being able to receive information from the state. This may be due to language, culture, functional ability, a lack of competence or lack of access to digital media. The budget for this measure for the 2008-2010 period is NOK 4.2 million. 
Implementation: As from 2008 Responsible: Ministry of Government Administration and Reform
Measure KOM2 The "Clear Speech" project intends to make it easier to read public information 
This measure is intended to help achieve clear speech in public forms, standard letters, websites, etc. The project has several sub-projects, including a clear-speech prize, a clear-speech website (klarspråk.no) and support for local measures. 
Implementation: As from 2009 Responsible: Ministry of Government Administration and Reform
Measure KOM3 Sign language to become more important.
Sign language is to be incorporated into  a general Language Act and the Norwegian Language Council will be assigned greater responsibility which also includes sign language. 
Implementation: As from 2009 
Responsible: Ministry of Culture and Church Affairs
3.5.4 Children and young people 
Children and young people must be ensured good conditions in which to grow up. The measures in the action plan's prioritised areas will improve the opportunities for children and young people with disabilities to take an education, use transport and participate in leisure-time activities and society as a whole. In addition, there is a need for measures that are particularly aimed at this group of the population. The Ministry of Children and Equality is responsible for the policy concerning children and young people and will among other things:
Measure BU1 The subsidy scheme entitled "Measures for children and young people in larger towns"
The objective of the subsidy scheme is to improve the conditions in which children and young people grow up and live in larger towns. One of the goals of the scheme is to ensure the participation of and equal opportunities for children and young people with disabilities. Local authorities that receive a subsidy through this scheme will be made aware of the requirement of universal design when arranging activities and measures. 
 
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: Ministry of Children and Equality
Measure BU2 Leisure-time activities for children with disabilities
In the spring of 2009, a group of experts presented a report on young people's leisure-time environments and participation in and influence over democratic processes. The group of experts refers to a mapping conducted by Rambøll Management on the orders of the Ministry of Education and Research. This points out, among other things, that the lack of physical accessibility to buildings, facilities and outdoor areas and the lack of transport opportunities to and from services and activities are barriers that prevent participation in leisure-time activities. The Ministry of Children and Equality will consider how to follow up the group's report. 
In 2008, NOVA mapped the leisure time and social inclusion of young people with disabilities. This was financed by the Ministry of Children and Equality. The report refers to the fact that factors which inhibit participation include a lack of adaptation of the material circumstances, such as transport opportunities and auditive communication, prejudiced attitudes and a lack of knowledge of the consequences of the individual functional impairment. This mapping will form the basis for further work in this area.
 
Implementation: As from 2009 
Responsible: Ministry of Children and Equality
3.5.5 Research and development
Universal design affects a number of professional areas and sectors of society. The strategy influences technical solutions in buildings, outdoor areas, transport and ICT, etc, as well as main social issues linked to equality and social and economic sustainability. 
Research and development work to increase the knowledge of how universal design can be implemented has been carried out and is still ongoing. State bodies are subject to the State Instructions for Official Studies and Reports, which means that the effects on equality are assessed with respect to people with disabilities.  Reforms and measures relating to buildings, facilities, transport, education and health may also apply.
In order to achieve the vision that Norway is to be universally designed by 2025, it will be necessary to finance research, reports and development projects in several areas in order to find the best solution. There is a need to clarify issues linked to such things as the understanding of universal design, development of technical and practical solutions and clarification of costs and benefits.   
Measure FOU1 The innovative programme 
"Innovation for Everyone" This is the further development and follow-up of the Norwegian Design Council's Design for Everyone project in the form of a new plan with a wider and longer perspective. The programme will emphasise the universal design of goods and services and international contacts. 
Implementation: As from 2009 
Responsible: Ministry of Trade and Industry/ Norwegian Design Council
Measure FOU2 Socio-economic benefits of universal design
Several ministries and state departments have calculated the costs and socio-economic benefits of universal design. There is a need to find a better methodology for calculating the benefits and more precise figures for the costs of implementing universal design. 
Implementation: As from 2009 
Responsible: Ministry of Children and Equality, Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development, Ministry of Transport and Communications, etc
Measure FOU3 Universal design in the university and university college sector The national driving-force unit at Norway's University of Science and Technology is to help implement, follow up and revise action plans for the universal design of universities and university colleges. This unit also follows up the plan to improve the expertise in universal design at educational institutions. This means, among other things, including universal design in the curricula and increasing the expertise of professional personnel. 
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: Ministry of Education and Research
Measure FOU4 Research into and expertise in children with disabilities in kindergartens Programme of practice-oriented research, training and development in the kindergarten sector. 
Implementation: As from 2009
Responsible: Ministry of Education and Research
Measure FOU5 A uniform school and universal design
A survey of the factors on which schools and school owners base the way in which they meet the challenges involved in the diversity of pupils in primary/lower secondary schools.  This survey is intended to help clarify what questions should be asked and which measures should be implemented when planning and developing a school that is to offer everyone an equal education and ensure the participation of and accessibility for all pupils. 
Implementation: As from 2009 
Responsible: The Delta Centre
4. Implementation of the action plan 
The Ministry of Children and Equality is coordinating the action plan. This is taking place in close cooperation with other ministries.  The action plan is anchored with the Parliamentary Secretary Committee on the overall policy for people with disabilities. For 2009, NOK 18.6 million has been transferred as a block grant from the Ministry of the Environment to the Ministry of Children and Equality in connection with a new division of responsibilities between the ministries linked to universal design. The action plan's funds will be steered towards cross-sectoral and highly prioritised measures. 
A forum with participants from interest groups, professional organisations and professional institutions will be established to provide information and feedback on the action plan's measures and progress. 
The action plan is to last for five years and be reviewed each year. Organisations and professional institutions are to be given an opportunity to propose adjustments in connection with the review of the action plan.
Information on the action plan and implementation of measures will be published on a separate website. 
The action plan will be evaluated.
