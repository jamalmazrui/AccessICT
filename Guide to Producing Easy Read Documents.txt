
How To Make Information Accessible

A guide to producing easy read documents

Why did we write this guide?

There are many reasons why someone may have difficulty with language and learning. There are almost a million people of all ages in England with a learning disability.
Information helps us all to make decisions and choices about our lives and enables us to live independently and take part fully in society. For many people, information is not readily and easily available. Having difficulty reading or writing, for whatever reason, can affect education; employment; finances; health and family life. It can prevent people from getting the information they need to make choices.
People who have learning disabilities have the expertise and knowledge to provide information to those who may find reading and writing difficult. CHANGE is an organisation led by disabled people and has over twenty years' experience making information accessible. We have produced this guide to help you make your written information more accessible.Who did we make this guide for?

This guide provides clear guidelines on producing documents and information in accessible, easy to read words and pictures for professionals and organisations. We hope that you will make your information more accessible for people with learning disabilities and others who may find it useful. We also want you to encourage other organisations to make their information accessible. 
This guide can help all organisations that offer NHS or Adult Social Care and must now follow the Accessible Information Standard by law. The aim of the Standard is to make sure that people who have a disability or sensory loss are given information in a way they understand, and communication support if they need it.

Accessible information is information that people can understand. It means different things to different people. For some people it is information in large print or Braille. For others it might be information translated into their first language.
When CHANGE talks about accessible information we are thinking of the needs of people who find reading and writing hard. For us, accessible information means Easy Words and Pictures.
Working with people with a learning disability, Easy Words and Pictures is a type of accessible information CHANGE have been developing over the past 20 years. Easy Words and Pictures has writing in short, simple sentences without any hard words or jargon.
Easy Words and Pictures also uses clear, easy to understand pictures that support these words. This type of information is very accessible to people with learning disabilities, but also to people who find reading and writing hard or do not have English as a first language. 
We have been using Easy Words and Pictures for a long time, we know that it is a good way to produce information that is accessible.
However, we also know that to get it right takes time and effort. You might not have the time or money to make all your information accessible to the CHANGE Easy Words and Pictures standard.
This is why it is very important for you to think carefully about which of your documents are going to be the most useful to people with learning disabilities. Those documents should be made accessible using Easy Words and Pictures. Other information could be made accessible using different methods such as video or animation.

Accessible information and the law
By law, disabled people have the right to be treated equally and to have information made accessible to them. This is stated in The Equality Act, 2010 and The Disability Discrimination Act 
(DDA). The Disability Discrimination Act was passed in 1995 to end the discrimination that many disabled people face.
The Act was extended in 2005 to give disabled people rights in the areas of employment, education and housing. 
The Equality Act, 2010 legally protects people from discrimination in the workplace and in wider society. It replaced previous anti-discrimination 
10     laws with a single Act, making the law easier to understand and strengthening protection in some situations. It sets out the different ways in which it is unlawful to treat someone.
A new Accessible Information Standard was also introduced on 24th June 2015 by the Standardisation Committee for Care Information (SCCI). The Accessible Information Standard tells organisations how they should ensure that disabled patients / service users and, where appropriate, carers and parents, receive information in formats that they can understand, and that they receive appropriate support to help them to communicate. 
All organisations that provide NHS or Adult Social Care must follow the Accessible Information Standard by law. The standard came into effect on 31st July 2016.
Accessibility and Presentation
Accessibility is more important than the way your document looks. You might spend a lot of money on making a document look impressive and professional but if no one can understand what it says, then that money is wasted. This does not mean, however, that accessible documents have to be second class or not as good as standard documents. People with learning disabilities, people who find reading and writing hard and people who do not speak English as a first language still have taste and a sense of what is made well.
Don't produce documents that look like you don't care. Not only will it make people feel like they are not valued, it will also make your organisation look bad. Finding the right balance between the way something is presented and the way it works can seem hard. But it does not have to be. 
Remember:
•        Always put accessibility first but take time and care when making your information accessible.
•        If your organisation is producing a range of documents (such as a large print version, an easy read version and versions in foreign languages) design them so they look and feel like they belong in a set and are equally important. That way no group will feel like they are being treated as separate or second class.
•        Plan the production of easy read documents at the same time you plan your standard documents. That way they do not become an afterthought and need to be rushed.
•        Put enough money aside for good quality printing.
•        Think about how you distribute your easy read documents. Leaving them lying around in places that are themselves not accessible to disabled people might be a waste of time and money.
Involving people with learning disabilities
People with learning disabilities are the experts on accessible information. This is because they know what works for them and what does not. It is common sense to involve the people you are trying to communicate with in your work process. 
Ideally you will involve people with learning disabilities from the very beginning by finding out from them, what kind of information it is they want. You should consult with people not only on the documents themselves but also on the best way to make them available. 
Consultations work best if you:
•        Make use of local advocacy groups or organisations run by disabled people whenever you can. They will have plenty of experience with accessible information and will be able to give you expert advice.
•        Work with people face to face in steering groups and workshops instead of over the phone or through the post.
•        Make sure you support people to get their views across and take what they say seriously.
•        Allow people enough time to give their feedback. You might need to work in small, accessible sessions instead of long, all day meetings.
•        If you must post material out to people, make sure they have the support they might need to give their feedback. You can do this by supporting people to set up steering groups in their place of work, advocacy group, care home, day 
           centre or local community.                            11
•        Make sure you give people enough background information about the document they are working on. This will ensure people can make informed comments.
If, at the start, you cannot involve people in making your document accessible, you should get feedback on the final draft of your document. It is important to consider the feedback and make any necessary amendments before distributing.

•        Concepts and abstract themes (e.g. national identity, enlightenment, civil courage, spirituality etc.)
•        Statistics (e.g. breakdown of the outcome of an opinion poll)
It is possible to put pictures to these types of text, but you will have to simplify the message. You will also have to be more creative with how you use pictures and maybe combine several pictures to make a clear statement. You might also need to commission new pictures drawn especially for your document. 
This is often the best solution and can get very good results. Just be careful your combinations of pictures do not become too complicated or they might 
14     end up as hard to 'read' as the text. The best way to make sure your pictures work, is to consult with people with learning disabilities directly.
You can make the task of finding the right pictures much easier, if you edit your information so that it contains only: • Clear instructions
•        Facts
•        Statements
Your information should try to limit or avoid: • Detailed background information
•        Multiple points of view
•        Statistics and data
•        Detailed explanations
•        Discussions and debates
•        Subtle variations on the same theme
How to choose the right pictures
In Easy Words and Pictures, each key statement should be supported by a picture. Once you have made your writing accessible (see 'Making the writing accessible' p. 26) read through your text and separate the sentences that contain key information or key statements. You should now have a series of single sentences or short paragraphs that each need to be supported by a picture. 
Go through them one by one and pick out the key word or key words in each. You can use the keyword or keywords to decide what picture you should choose. In the same way, the keyword is the focus of the sentence, it should be the focus of the picture.
However in many cases it is not enough for the picture to simply show the person, object or place that is the focus of the text you are working with. 
Whenever possible, the picture should also reflect the statement that is being made about that person, object or place.
'Many people in the area said they were worried about their homes being burgled.'
This picture shows a burglar, but does not show people worrying about being burgled.
'Many people in the area said they were worried about their homes being burgled.'
This picture shows someone saying they are worried about being burgled.
When re-writing your text in easy words, you will notice that there is often more than one way to say something. It is the same with pictures. Do not get too worried about finding the one perfect picture that shows exactly what you want to say. Instead, be creative and work with what you have.
The solution is often to combine pictures or to add extras like:
•        Speech and thought bubbles (with additional pictures in them, not words)
•        Arrows
•        Ticks and crosses 
•        Thumbs up or thumbs down

look at how they can make their homes safer.'
This pictures shows people discussing ways in which their homes could be made safer.
'This is why we will support people to 
look at how they can make their homes safer.'
This picture shows ways in which homes could be made safer.
16    The first picture is the better solution but both pictures are acceptable. This shows that there is often more than one solution when working with Easy Words and Pictures.
Which documents to make accessible
You should try to make as much of your information accessible as you possibly can. But if you cannot make all your information accessible or if you cannot afford to commission new images for all your publications, try to focus your resources on those documents that are going to be the most useful to people with learning disabilities. Remember that it is better for people to have one truly accessible document they can read, than five slightly accessible documents they cannot read.
If you must choose which of your documents to make accessible using Easy Words and Pictures, consider the following:
•        What information is going to be truly useful to your audience? Peoples lead busy lives, if they take the time to read your documents, you should make sure it is worth their while.
•        You can do this by consulting with people with learning disabilities directly. Support people to tell you what information they think is going to be useful to them.
•        How many people will be affected by the information in your document? Some types of information are so specific, they are going to be of use to only a handful of people. Instead of spending money on an easy read version, maybe you could simply speak to these people over the phone or in person.
•        How long are your documents? If you have a series of lengthy reports and policies to choose from, consider which ones can be summed up most effectively. It is easier to work on a well done summary that highlights the most important points, than it is to work on a long document that cannot be condensed any further.
•        How complex is the information? Documents with clear instructions or facts can be made accessible more effectively than complex ones.
•        Can you combine key points from different documents? If you still have trouble deciding which of your documents to make accessible, maybe you can combine the most important points from different documents in one accessible 'newsletter'.
•        Is there an alternative to Easy Words and Pictures? Easy Words and Pictures is not the only way to make information accessible. Video clips are good alternatives. Posting accessible information on online platforms is also a great tool. Or what about an open day with workshops held in the local community?
Every person is an individual. If you follow the advice in this guide, you can produce information that is accessible to many, many different people not just those with learning disabilities. Within communities there are those with low literacy skills, non-readers, non-native speakers as well as those with impairments that mean the written word/signage/instructions are not always accessible. 
Many people in past have shown a preference to easy to read alternatives, despite being able to access information easily. The key is knowing the people you are aiming to inform and involving them.
But there is no such thing as a perfect solution that will suit everyone. Many people will still need support to access easy read documents. Others will need information in a completely different format. 
Do not let this worry you. Information in Easy Words and Pictures, done well, makes a powerful tool to support the empowerment and inclusion of anyone who finds reading and writing hard. With it you will create an empowering starting point for your audience.
Thank you for working towards putting more people in the picture!

Use a clear, easy to read font and make it at least 14pt in size. If you can, try to make the font 16pt or even bigger.
It is important that your font is clear and easy to read. It should not have any serifs or complicated letter shapes.
Most people will find fonts that are made to look like handwriting or cursive harder to read than printed fonts.
A good font to use is Arial or something that looks similarly plain. Examples of good fonts include: Tahoma, Verdana, Myriad, Helvetica, Calibri, Candara, Corbel, Segoe, and Gill Sans amongst many others.

Your text should be aligned to the left and have a ragged edge on the right. This layout will look familiar to most people. It will make blocks of text easier to read than right aligned, centred, justified or forced text.
Having a toned background behind your text reduces the glare of the paper and makes the text easier to read. Any pastel shade is better than white. It is an individual's preference on what colour works for them.
If you use a toned background, make sure that there is still enough contrast between background and text.
 
Do not try to squash things in or fit too much information on one page. Lots of white space makes the page look less intimidating and helps people find their way around your document.
Be aware that some people reading your document might be colour blind. 
When designing your document, it is a good idea never to rely on colours alone to make things clear.
Think about using a colour code in your document. This will help people to navigate through your text and to keep track of different chapters or sections. Make sure the colour code is introduced in the index.

Use bullet points and sub-headings to break up text and organise information. This will make it easier for people to pick out and remember the facts. However, bullet points alone do not make a document accessible.The name of the play is A Midsummer

Be careful when using symbols, rare characters and certain types of punctuation in your text. Characters like the ampersand (&) or symbols such as the one for percent (%) might be unfamiliar to people. Try not to use the following: #, &, ~, %, ^, /, £, $, €, { },
Be careful when using acronyms and abbreviations.

Be very careful about what picture you select to use with the text. Does the picture reflect what the text is saying? Have you used the same picture earlier in the text to say something different?
Be careful not to use symbols, symbolic pictures or abstract graphics. These can confuse people because often their meaning has to be learned.
Sometimes it is easier to use a photo than a picture. Especially if you are trying to show a particular object, building or person. There is nothing wrong with using a photo, just be extra careful that it is not too busy or confusing. Look out for things like bad lighting, cluttered backgrounds or blurred features. Also make sure you apply the same rules you would to a picture.34      
Ask yourself these questions when working on easy read documents

Have you left enough space for your pictures (at least 8cm) and are they big enough and of good quality?
Have you arranged the pictures so it is easy to see which part of text they belong to?
Do the pictures reflect what the text is saying?
If you have used photos, are they of a good quality and easy to see? 
Will they look good in black and white if the document is photocopied?
Have you chosen a clear, easy to read font that is at least 14pt big? Could the text be made 16pt big?
Have you broken your text up into smaller chunks by using bullet points and sub-headings?
Have you added extra space between the lines of text?
Have you written your information in short, easy read sentences? Are there any hard words, jargon words, abbreviations or symbols left in the text?
Could you add a toned background behind the text to reduce glare from the whiteness of the paper and help people with dyslexia?
Have you chosen a suitable size and format for your document? Is the paper too reflective or too thin?
Do your pages look cramped, cluttered or too busy? Maybe the layout could be simplified.
Has your work been checked by people with learning disabilities? Have you used their experience and knowledge to make sure your document is truly accessible?
