<p>Why accessibility</p>
<p>matters</p>
<p>Did you know that over 1 billion1 people</p>
<p>worldwide live with a disability? Yet</p>
<p>they’re often excluded from connecting</p>
<p>with brands and digital marketing</p>
<p>due to access barriers. It may surprise</p>
<p>you, but their exclusion impacts us all.</p>
<p>Without the voices and contributions</p>
<p>What is accessibility?</p>
<p>of people with varied experiences, we</p>
<p>aren’t able to reach our full potential</p>
<p>on any given project, initiative or idea.</p>
<p>Accessibility is when products, services, environments, Digital
inclusion provides opportunities</p>
<p>digital media and marketing are designed so everyone and access to
services, products, data,</p>
<p>- including people living with permanent, temporary or information
and education for all.</p>
<p>The challenges of people living with</p>
<p>situational disabilities - can fully experience them.</p>
<p>disabilities are real and the business</p>
<p>opportunity they represent is large. As</p>
<p>A wide range of disabilities affect the way that people access
marketing, including physical marketers, we have the opportunity to</p>
<p>disabilities like loss of mobility, blindness and deafness or
learning difficulties like dyslexia.</p>
<p>recognize exclusions, solve for them,</p>
<p>If you don’t design for accessibility, you exclude a large segment of
the global population and make a difference in the lives</p>
<p>who could be your customers.</p>
<p>of many people.</p>

<p>What does</p>
<p>Accessibility is a human imperative</p>
<p>accessibility in</p>
<p>Empowering everyone is the right thing to do for many reasons. To
begin with, accessibility is a human right. All people should have the
ability to get <strong>marketing mean?</strong></p>
<p>what they want and need with equal opportunity and safety.
Accessibility is essential. The right to enjoy meaningful participation
in the world both Accessibility in marketing is</p>
<p>off and online involves easy access. The degree to which a person can
about making it easy for everyone to</p>
<p>access opportunities impacts the quality of their life. Accessibility
empowers experience your marketing, receive and</p>
<p>the widest range of people to unlock their abilities, and live life
fully.</p>

<p>Inaccessibility negatively impacts all aspects of life including
economic, have the opportunity to invest in or</p>
<p>social and mental wellness. Many countries around the world require

<p>web accessibility — it’s the law. See the full list here: <a

<p>brand. To do this effectively, accessibility</p>
<p>must be built into the beginning of every</p>
<p>communication, process, product and</p>
<p>Accessibility is a business imperative</p>
<p>service rather than bolting it on later.</p>
<p>This might mean providing information</p>
<p>The more people you reach the more you can serve, so accessibility in
alternate formats, such as captions</p>
<p>is good business. Designing with accessibility in mind goes beyond or
audio descriptions for video and more</p>
<p>compliance by providing more effective customer interactions,
accessible emails and websites. It also</p>
<p>increased productivity and innovation. We are on a journey to
includes enabling optimized experiences</p>
<p>understand the full impact that inclusion has on productivity when
using assistive technologies —</p>
<p>and innovation, but one thing is clear: designing for inclusion such
as screen readers.</p>
<p>means everyone can do and achieve more.</p>

<p>Business value of accessibility</p>
<p>Understanding disability and impairment</p>
<p>Accessible communication increases audience reach For most of the
20th century, the definition</p>
<p>to reflect the point of interaction between</p>

<p>a person and their environment, it’s now</p>

<p>recently, the concept of what disability is</p>
<p>considered an accessibility problem.</p>
<p>Attract and reach a wider pool of potential</p>
<p>has changed dramatically. It’s important to</p>
<p>customers of all abilities by making it easy</p>
<p>understand this change in order to</p>
<p>to access your marketing content</p>
<p>see how society impacts those living</p>
<p>with disabilities and impairments.</p>
<p>Increase business impact</p>
<p>The larger the audience you can serve through</p>
<p>In 1980 the World Health Organization</p>
<p>accessible websites and communications,</p>
<p>defined disability as ‘an attribute of a</p>
<p>the higher revenue impact is possible</p>
<p>person’. They recently redefined it to mean</p>
<p>‘a mismatch between the needs of an</p>

<p>individual and a product, service, or social</p>
<p>Disability is a</p>
<p>personal issue</p>
<p>Leverage built-in assistive technologies and support structure
offered’. This is revolutionary. The</p>
<p>services to meet requirements</p>
<p>distinction is: ‘impairments’ are problems</p>
<p>that may prevent people from doing</p>
<p>something. ‘Disability’ is the additional</p>
<p>disadvantage added by a society that</p>
<p>treats ‘impairments’ as abnormal, which</p>

<p>unnecessarily excluding people from full</p>
<p>Imagine if a town was designed with wheelchairs in participation in
society. Why does this shift</p>
<p>mind, without stairs or escalators. If we designed matter so much?
Historically, disability</p>

the result of an individual’s</p>
<p>Disability is a mismatch</p>
<p>independent as everyone else. It is society that puts between needs
and offerings</p>
<p>condition - it was their problem and</p>
<p>barriers up for people by not making environments responsibility. By
changing the definition</p>
<p>accessible to everyone. Marketers can make a</p>
<p>positive impact by solving for these exclusions</p>
<p>in our own campaigns and storytelling.</p>

<p>Recognizing</p>
<p>exclusion sparks</p>
<p>innovation</p>
<p>Consider how many of your potential custom-</p>
<p>ers may live with a disability or impairment</p>
<p>that impacts how they interact with your dig-</p>
<p>ital marketing. As a marketer, you have the</p>
<p>opportunity to recognize these exclusions and</p>
<p>create changes that make a difference. Rec-</p>
<p>ognizing and removing barriers to your mar-</p>
<p>keting represents an incredible opportunity to</p>
<p>expand the reach of your brand —</p>
<p>and it’s easier than you think.</p>
<p>70% of disabilities are not visible1</p>
<p>Exclusion happens when we solve problems</p>
<p>based on our own biases. To design inclusive</p>
<p>solutions and campaigns, we must get close</p>
<p>An unconscious bias many people share,</p>
<p>of our work and collaboration increasing-</p>
<p>to our customers. Proximity drives empathy,</p>
<p>is that disability is something we can see</p>
<p>ly happening at a distance. In addition,</p>
<p>which uncovers insights. That’s where the</p>
<p>with our eyes. For example, a person is in a</p>
<p>we often market to or communicate with</p>
<p>‘Aha!’ moments for invention arise from.</p>
<p>wheelchair or missing a limb. But the truth</p>
<p>people on the phone, via video, or in text,</p>
<p>is, it’s not always obvious when someone</p>
<p>when doing search marketing. As a result,</p>
<p>By exploring what someone goes through that</p>
<p>lives with a disability. In fact, the majority</p>
<p>we don’t always have insight into the expe-</p>
<p>causes them to be excluded from accomplishing</p>
<p>of disabilities aren’t visible. Chronic illness,</p>

<p>What is inclusive design?</p>
<p>Inclusive design is an approach born out of digital environments,
that learns from and enables the full range of human diversity. For
marketers, inclusive design means creating marketing that’s accessible
to all people, including those with disabilities and impairments.</p>
<p>To learn mor<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/">e
about inclusive design, click here</a>: <a
href="https://aka.ms/InslvDesign">aka.ms/InslvDesign.</a></p>
<p>At Microsoft, we focus on three human-center design principles:
Recognize</p>
<p>Solve for one,</p>
<p>Learn from</p>
<p>exclusions</p>
<p>extend to many</p>
<p>diversity</p>
<p>Building it in, not bolting it on</p>
<p><strong>Design for the edges</strong> is an approach that optimizes
innovation for as many people as possible. It goes beyond the idea that
things should be designed for the ‘average’</p>
<p>person. Instead, the idea is to optimize for the full range of human
characteristics, traits, abilities and interests. When modern life is
set up in an accessible way for people living with impairments, they

<p>1 Content writing and structure</p>
<p>2 URL, Link text and descriptions</p>
<p>Being intentional with your content structure and content writing is
very important to Link descriptions are an easy and important element to
focus on for accessible content. For those using only a keyboard to
access content. This is usually people with vision loss, who example,
the phrase “Click here” can be difficult to interpret for someone using
a screen rely on a screen reader or narrator to make web pages audible.
Clear writing that’s easy reader, even if it precedes more specific
information. Put yourself in the shoes of a person to read and has a
logical structure is also extremely important for those with cognitive
or with vision loss, and imagine all the ‘Click here’ calls-to-action
you come across on any given learning disabilities, along with everyone
in a hurry or on a mobile screen. Remember to day. They don’t always
explain what the person gets for ‘clicking here’. To make a ‘Click use
clean, semantic markup for headings, paragraphs, lists, block quotes,
etc. Headings are here’ link more accessible you can write it like this:
‘Click here to access today’s weather.’</p>
<p>also a critical element that helps make navigating content
easier.</p>
<p>It can also be shortened to ‘Today’s weather’. In some cases, you may
want to precede a linked phrase with ‘Get’ or ‘Get info about’, such as
‘Get info about today’s weather’. As with <strong>Headings</strong></p>
<p>all written content, keep it streamlined with as few extra words as
possible. For example, Use heading tags: &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;</p>
<p>‘Today’s weather’ rather than ‘Get info about today’s weather.’</p>
<p>Make sure headings follow correct hierarchy</p>

<p>‘at risk’, and ‘blocking’ along with those colors to help colorblind

<p>10 Marketing event space and registration</p>
<p>In some cases, call-to-action buttons don’t include all the
information required for screen readers. To make sure your
call-to-action buttons are accessible, be sure to include Ensure venue
accessibility</p>
<p>additional information in the “aria-label” attribute.</p>
<p>The venue should provide a number of things to make it accessible
including: specific parking allocations, braille signage on amenities,
automatic doors at entrances, access to elevators if venue is
multi-level, wheelchair accessible bathrooms.</p>
<p>Language to include during the registration process It’s important to
include language in your registration information—</p>
<p>something along the lines of: “We strive to create a welcoming and
accessible environment for all attendees. If you require an
accommodation for a disability please contact [Name] at [Contact
information] by</p>
<p>[Date— a minimum of 2 weeks prior to the event]”.</p>
<p>Floor plan considerations</p>
<p>Make sure there’s enough space in the aisles for wheelchair access
and service dogs. If you have an elevated stage for presenters, include
a ramp with railings. To avoid segregating those with disabilities to
the sides and back of the room, leave open spaces at tables or in rows
throughout the room for wheelchairs.</p>
<p>Auditory and vision considerations</p>
<p>Create auditory queues at registration. Avoid low lighting for your
event, as it makes it hard to see ASL interpreters. If your event has
low lighting, make sure the interpreter is well lit. Provide real-time
captioning of all event speakers.</p>

<p>Windows 10 eye gaze control</p>
<p>Windows 10 PCs can now be controlled with your eyes. Eye control
enables people with mobility impairment such as ALS &amp; quadriplegia
to use eye tracking technology to control their mouse pointer, navigate
online, type with an on-screen keyboard and communicate with people
using text-to-speech. All you need is a Tobii USB camera—around $160
USD.</p>
<p>Microsoft translator</p>
<p>Microsoft Translator services can help you create inclusive
presentations using PowerPoint. You can translate text, pictures and
more into 60+ languages and can add subtitles that appear as you speak.
This is a great feature not only for the hearing-impaired community, but
also foreign language speakers.</p>

<p>Accessibility Checker</p>
<p>This is the #1 accessibility tool</p>
<p>for all content and is easy to use.</p>
<p>The Accessibility Checker allows users to check the accessibility of
their material throughout Microsoft 365, in order to create more
accessible content. This feature is easily discoverable in Word, Excel,
PowerPoint, OneNote, Outlook, and more. We enhanced the Accessibility
Checker to streamline the process of creating quality content that’s
accessible to people with disabilities. It also utilizes AI to make
intelligent suggestions for improvements. For more information visit: <a
href="https://aka.ms/Inclusionworkplace">aka.ms/Inclusionworkplace.</a></p>
<p>How it works</p>
<p>Before sharing content, you can run the Accessibility Checker to find
and fix any issues that might make your content difficult for people
with disabilities to use. Select ‘Check Accessibility’ under the
‘Review’ tab to get started. The checker analyzes your document, reveals
accessibility issues and provides specific recommendations within your
document about how to fix accessibility errors and create a more
accessible piece of content.</p>

<p>Accessible emails in Outlook</p>
<p>At least 12 million1 people in the U.S. use a screen reader, a screen
magnifier, or braille to read email. Making all emails accessible
ensures that when you send email to a broad distribution you’ll also
reach and connect with millions of people in your audience who have
limited or no vision. Nearly all assistive technology is designed to
work well with HTML, rather than plain text. With HTML, your messages
can include formatted links with display text, lists, headings, and Alt
Text for images.</p>
<p>Watch this video: <a
href="https://aka.ms/EmailAccessibilityTools">aka.ms/EmailAccessibilityTools</a>
to see how you can make your email messaging more accessible, regardless
of what email program you use.</p>
<p>Accessible PowerPoint presentations</p>
<p>PowerPoint has become easier and more efficient for authoring and
reading slides and speaker notes. It’s very accessible for customers
using a keyboard or assistive technology, including screen readers. This
includes reliable High Contrast even in menus and galleries, proofing,
comments, and co-authoring. Watch this video: <a

<p>Stream</p>
<p>Microsoft Stream is an intelligent video service that makes it easy
to create, securely share, and interact with video. Auto-captioning
speech to text, auto-generated closed-captions, and face detection
features create more ways to find and interact with videos—so everyone
can access relevant content quickly and easily. Stream also makes it
easy to search closed-captioning, helping people who are blind or have
vision loss find exactly what they want. Read more about Video and
Stream her<a href="https://aka.ms/Streaminfo">e:

<p>Accessible Excel workbooks</p>
<p>People who are blind or have vision loss can understand your data
more easily if you create your Excel workbooks and charts with
accessibility in mind. Prebuilt Excel templates can also help save time
and improve the accessibility of the content that you create.</p>
<p>To discover how to make your Excel workbooks more accessible, watch
this video about Excel workbook templates: <a

style="width:4.52778in;height:2.375in" alt="Image 29" /></p>
<p>Closed-captions</p>
<p>Adding closed-captions makes your presentation accessible to a larger
audience, including people with hearing loss and those who speak
languages other than the language used in your video. Now you can add
closed-captions or subtitles to any video and audio file in your
PowerPoint presentations. Read more about Closed-caption here: <a
href="https://aka.ms/CloseCaptionPPT">aka.ms/CloseCaptionPPT.</a></p>
<p>Video and audio transcription</p>
<p>Automated transcription services using AI technology can be used
while viewing a video or listening to an audio file. A full transcript
(improving both accessibility and search) appears in the viewer, which
supports over 320 different file types. This helps people use their
personal video and audio assets, as well as collaborate better with
others.</p>

<p>Automatic Alternative Text (Alt Text)</p>
<p>This feature leverages intelligent image analysis powered by the
Microsoft Computer Vision Cognitive Service to automatically suggest
descriptions for photos, objects and other images in PowerPoint, Word ad
Outlook—without requiring the use of a content creator. AI-based
suggestions help you save time and ensure your media-rich content is
accessible to viewers who are blind or have vision loss and use screen
readers. Learn more about Microsoft Computer Vision Cognitive Services
here:</p>
<p><a
href="https://aka.ms/MSComputerVision">aka.ms/MSComputerVision</a>.</p>
<p>The Alt Text on a document informs users that the description has
been automatically generated. It provides a confidence rating regarding
the accuracy of the image description. In addition, Alt Text isn’t
needed for decorative images, and it’s not necessary to repeat content
already included on the page. To manually add or change Alt Text, go to
the right click menu in Office. This placement makes it easy to check
auto-generated descriptions for accuracy and provide alt text on charts,
graphs, and other media. Machine learning algorithms will continue to
improve Automatic Alt Text over time.</p>
