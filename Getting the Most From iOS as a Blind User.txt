Quick Start
Note: Due to the increased variety of devices, you may encounter differences between what is covered here and what you experience on your particular device. However, basic operating concepts will still be applicable. Keep calm and think through your actions. Don't panic.
    This Quick Start section gives a bare minimum of instructions needed for blind owners of iOS devices to start using them effectively. The reader is strongly encouraged to read further in this guide and seek more instructions elsewhere. This is essential in order to fully grasp the potential of their iOS device and learn how to optimize their experience. Three resources are mentioned later in this section. Many more can be found in the section called Helpful Resources located near the end of this guide.
Orientation:
If you have an older iOS device, or some more recent models, it may have a round, concave button at the bottom of the touchscreen. This is called the Home button.
    Absolutely all iPhones have three features which feel different at the bottom end of the device. At the bottom left is the short microphone grill. To its right is a rectangular slot which is a Lightning or USB-C port depending on the age of your iPhone. At the bottom right is a speaker grill which is noticeably longer than the microphone grill. When holding your iPhone in portrait mode, do so with these features closest to you.
    On the left and right edges of the device, you may find different controls depending on your model of iPhone. At the very minimum, there are three long thin buttons. The button on the right edge is the "Power" button. The two adjacent shorter buttons along the left side are Volume Up/Down. Other than these buttons, which are nearer the top of the iPhone, more modern iPhones will have another small button above the volume buttons. This button is called an "Action" button. Older iPhones will have a small indented switch which turn silent mode on or off. Some iPhones have a long, smooth and thin control surface along the right side nearer the bottom. This is called a camera control. It is both touch and pressure sensitive.
    At the top right corner of the back of every iPhone, there are two or more circular camera lenses. This arrangement of features makes it possible to hold the iPhone in one hand while avoiding the risk of accidentally activating the buttons or covering the cameras.
Holding an iPhone:
These devices may be used while on tables, stands or other surfaces. However, they are designed to be used most often while held in one hand. They may be used in portrait or landscape modes. Portrait orientation makes more vertical viewing space available. The bottom edge with the microphone and speaker grills is closest to your body or the ground while the top edge is farthest upward or away from your body similar to how a TV remote would be held. Meanwhile, landscape orientation would have the bottom edge with the speaker, microphone, and port facing to the left or right so the iPhone is sideways. To hold the iPhone securely in portrait orientation, place it in your left or right hand with your thumb and fingers on opposite sides. Curl your fingers partially around the iPhone so it is gripped securely by the sides and back. Don't extend your curled fingers over top of the screen. This must be clear of any fingers not used to control the iPhone.
    The iPhone is also often held in landscape orientation with the screen facing towards the user so that it extends horizontally in front of the face. This is useful for viewing videos or other cases where it is advantageous for information to be horizontally presented offering a wider view. Use a similar grip with the thumb beneath the left or right edge of the iPhone while fingers curl around the back and past the opposite edge. As before, do not bend your fingers overtop of the screen, which should be facing you.
    When using Braille screen input mode, people hold their iPhones sideways in both hands. They extend their fingers beneath the lower facing side to curl around and enter characters. The iPhone rests on the palms of their hands which curl under and grip the iPhone.
    People also hold an iPhone vertically by one's ear or in front of the face to facilitate video and audio communication. While the iPhone is close to the ear, a sensor will activate to make certain the cheek isn't mistaken for fingers.
    It is possible to use the fingers of the hand holding the iPhone to activate the buttons on the sides. However, people generally use the other hand to flick, swipe, tap and perform gestures needed to make use of the touchscreen. This provides the easiest optimal control.
iPhone Activation and Shutdown:
To turn on your device, find the single button along the right or top edge of your device. This is the Power button. Push and hold it in for around four seconds and then release. This should activate your device, presuming the battery is charged. Plugging in your device or properly placing it on a wireless charging pad is the best, most certain way for a beginner to cause any iOS device to turn on if it is capable of doing so. If your device is plugged in, presuming the mute switch is off and your volume is high enough, there will be a small chirp when it has finished booting and is ready. On iPhones with the A14 or newer chips, it is possible to get a vibration and sound to indicate when power is turned on or off. After booting is complete, it will be in a locked state. Swipe up with one finger to initiate unlocking procedures to reach the home screen. After setup, reaching the home screen will require entering a passcode or using face or touch ID once these security measures are turned on.
    To shut down the iPhone, use one of the following methods:
1. Go into settings, general, shutdown. Flick right until you come to the button called "power off". Double tap this button with one finger.
2. The second method requires some practice. Hold the left volume up button plus the "Power" button in simultaneously for over a second. A dialogue will then appear. The left most option is power off. Be certain you're on that option before double tapping with one finger. The other option allows you to call emergency services, so be certain you choose the right option for your needs.
3. Go into the control centre. Find the "power" option near the top right of the screen and double tap this. You will then be in the shutdown dialogue with the "power off" and "emergency call" options. Double tap on "Power off" and your iPhone will shut down.
Setup:
These instructions presume that sighted help is available or that you have experienced help at hand. For more detailed instructions suitable for blind beginners who need to set their device up on their own, go to the final second-level heading in this Quick Start information.
    Your device has a built-in screen reader called VoiceOver that makes it useable for blind people. Presuming your device is powered on, the first thing to do is activate this feature. If you are setting up your device, it may not be connected to cellular data or Wi-Fi. In this case:
1. Press the Home button three times rapidly. If your device doesn't have one, press the "Power" button on the right side three times in quick succession. This will cause VoiceOver to activate during the setup process. If you want to be able to activate and deactivate VoiceOver in this manner after setup is complete, set the Accessibility Shortcut to VoiceOver. Find it in Settings, Accessibility. This should be done as soon as possible once setup is complete so that blind users can always restart VoiceOver regardless of connectivity circumstances. Sighted helpers, be aware that once VoiceOver is turned on, the screen will go dark due to a feature called "screen curtain". This is to protect the privacy of blind users. Also, the gestures needed to interact with the device will change. Turn off screen curtain by tapping three fingers at once on the device three times rapidly. Alternatively, tell Siri "turn off screen curtain". Siri is also capable of turning VoiceOver on or off if asked to do so.
2. During the setup process, you may hear your device begin to say "hello" in English and other languages. The easiest way of getting past this is to use the Back button found in the top-left corner. This will exit the language selection process, and setup will proceed with the default language for the region your device determines itself to be in. Otherwise, you can find and double tap the button that says "hello" in the language you wish when that language is currently displayed on that button.
3. Follow the instructions to set up your device. Read them by flicking left or right with your finger to go forward and backward. Tap twice quickly on things you want to interact with. When typing, double tap on an edit field to enter it. VoiceOver should say "is editing" when ready to type. The default method of typing is called "standard typing". Feel around the onscreen keyboard until you find the letter, number, or symbol you need. Then, tap twice quickly to enter that character. Alternatively, you can hold your finger down on the item and tap with another finger anywhere on the screen. There are three alternative methods of typing to choose from as you gain proficiency.
4. When creating an Apple account, pick carefully. You can use an email address you already have, if you prefer, and need not use iCloud for email. Select a password that is easy to remember. It is your key to everything! Decide with care so you don't forget it.
5. The same goes for a passcode, which is like a PIN number you might select to secure your device. Pick a number you won't forget.
If you purchased this device in a store and there is help available to set things up, it is even easier to activate VoiceOver. Once you are connected to cellular data or Wi-Fi, do the following:
1. Press and hold in the Home or Action button until a beep is heard.
2. Say: "turn on VoiceOver".
3. The device should then say "OK. I turned on VoiceOver".
4. Press the Home button to return to the home screen. If your device has no Home button, touch the bottom of the screen. Hold your finger down once you've heard a short low beep or tick. You'll also feel a slight bump. Slide your finger upwards until you hear a higher, short beep, and then lift it from the screen to return to the home screen.
Now that VoiceOver is on, your device will behave in a manner more suitable for sightless exploration and operation. Be aware that this will make it harder for sighted people, since they are used to different gestures and behaviour. Touching anywhere on the screen will read what is directly beneath your finger. Unlike other screen readers, VoiceOver doesn't simplify screen layout. Instead, it facilitates blind navigation and exploration. To indicate that you want to interact with something on the screen, tap twice quickly with a finger. After setup is complete, be certain to make blind users aware of the built-in tutorial for VoiceOver available on devices running iOS 18 or later. It can be found by going into Settings, Accessibility, VoiceOver and then double tapping on the VoiceOver tutorial button. For more important VoiceOver gestures, see the following:
Basic VoiceOver Gestures:
Tapping twice quickly with four fingers spaced slightly apart will activate VoiceOver Help mode. This mode lets you practice gestures and announces what they will do when performed outside of Help mode. When you're finished with Help mode, a four-finger double tap will exit. Pressing the Home button also exits Help mode, but exits whatever app you might be working in, bringing you to your current home screen. VoiceOver should speak short instructions such as "double tap to open" as you move around the screen. If you don't hear such advice, go to the Verbosity section in the settings for VoiceOver and enable Hints.
    Touching anywhere on the screen using one finger will speak what is displayed. To activate an item or choice, tap twice quickly on it with one finger. This is called a one-finger double tap, since you are performing two quick taps with one finger. Alternatively, you can examine the screen with one finger and select or activate things by holding your exploration finger on the desired object and then tapping anywhere on the screen with another finger. This is called a split tap. Another very useful gesture to know right away is called a two-finger double tap. This involves tapping twice quickly using two fingers at the same time. This answers and ends phone calls or causes audio such as music to pause or resume.
    You can explore the screen by flicking your finger left or right. VoiceOver will move to each element starting at the top left and moving across and downward to the bottom right row by row. Flicking downward with two fingers causes VoiceOver to read continuously from the currently selected position. This allows continuous reading of books with automatic page turning. During such reading, a single tap using two fingers will pause and resume progress. Swiping with three fingers left or right will scroll one page in the opposite direction of your motion. Swiping left or right with four fingers will switch between apps you currently have open.
The Rotor:
This set of gestures is essential for efficient use of VoiceOver. Take two fingers and imagine there is a small knob on the screen. Place the tips of your fingers on the screen as if you were grasping a knob. Rotate your fingers clockwise or counterclockwise as if you turned a knob. This will bring different settings and options into focus. An alternative method for turning the rotor is as follows:
1. Place a finger from your left hand anywhere along the left side of the screen, and a finger from your right hand across from it on the right edge. Your two fingertips should be pointing at each other.
2. Move one finger upwards while moving the other downwards. For example, move your left finger upwards towards the top of the screen, while your right finger moves downwards towards the bottom. Both fingers should move at the same time. This will turn the rotor one selection to the right. Moving your right finger upwards while the left moves downwards will turn the rotor to the left.
3. The above steps serve to highlight a choice in a menu having many options. At least one of these options will always be highlighted. The system will attempt to be helpful by changing the highlighted option to one most appropriate for the current context. For instance, it will often turn to the "actions" setting which allows interaction with elements on the touchscreen. This may not be the option that you actually desire.
4. To interact with the option selected by the rotor, flic up or downward with one finger. This will change the value of the option. For example, if speech rate is selected, flicking upwards will increase the speed, while flicking downwards will slow speech.
5. While learning how to use your device, remember to leave the rotor on a safe option, such as Characters or Words. This will prevent accidentally disabling Hints or changing volume or speech rate.
Settings:
The Settings icon is on your home screen. Double tapping it takes you to where you can configure all aspects of your device. Many settings are found within subsections of the main collection of Settings. Flicking left or right will navigate through Settings. Double tapping on a desired item will activate it. Should you wish to back out of a setting or subsection, find the Back button located at the top left of the screen, and double tap this with one finger. Many settings are toggles that can be on or off. Double tapping on these changes their state. If a setting says "button" after its value is stated, double tapping on it won't deactivate the setting. One such example is the settings for VoiceOver found within the Accessibility subsection of Settings. To get there:
1. Flick right through Settings until you reach Accessibility.
2. Double tap the Accessibility option.
3. Flick right through these settings until you reach the VoiceOver option. It should say "VoiceOver on button". This indicates that VoiceOver is activated and that double tapping its option will move you into VoiceOver settings rather than deactivating it. Other major settings work similarly.
4. When finished making adjustments, you can exit the Settings area by pressing the Home button or invoking the equivalent gesture on current devices with no Home button. This returns you to your home screen. The next time you enter the Settings app, you will be placed where you were when you used the Home button to exit, or will simply find yourself in the top menu of Settings.
Important Gestures for Devices with no Home Button:
Several key areas of iOS are reached via sliding one finger up the screen from the bottom or down from the top of your device. As you move your finger, you'll hear short beeps which increase in pitch the farther you slide your finger from the edge without lifting it. The first beep is lowest and indicates that you have touched near enough to the very edge so that it recognizes that you wish to perform one of these sliding gestures.
    Moving your finger upward from the bottom, the first higher beep you come to indicates that you wish to go to the home screens. These are where any apps or folders you have available can be found. Lift your finger to reach this area of iOS. Continuing to slide your finger upward until a third higher beep is heard indicates you wish to reach the app switcher. Lift your finger to reach this area where it is possible to close opened apps or quickly reach an app which is already open and running in the background.
    Similarly, sliding your finger downward from the top of your iPhone provides you with access to the control centre and the notification center. Slide your finger down to the second beep and then lift it to reach the control centre. This lets you access numerous functions. Slide further downward to the third beep in order to reach the notification centre. This is where any information generated by various apps running in the background may be reviewed.
Obtaining Further Instructions:
First and foremost, beginners are strongly encouraged to make use of the VoiceOver tutorial which is now built in for any iPhone running iOS 18 or later. Go to Settings, Accessibility, VoiceOver, and then double tap on the VoiceOver Tutorial option. Doing this as soon as possible will greatly assist your experience in all other aspects of using your iPhone while blind. There are many different sources of help for blind users of iOS devices. One of the best starting places is the Applevis website found at:
    www.applevis.com.
    This website is home to a thriving community of blind users keen to share their discoveries and expertise. Browse through the tutorials, podcasts, and directories of apps.
    Another excellent free and thorough tutorial website is:
    www.hadley.edu
    There, you'll find instructional videos and tutorials to help get you started with your iOS device.
    Finally, Apple Inc. has produced electronic user guides for all of its products. You can get the appropriate guide for your device free of charge and then read it using an app called Books. This app is found on your home screen and serves as both bookstore and personal library.
How to Get and Read Your User Guide:
Find the icon called Books on your home screen. Double tap it with one finger to cause Apple Books to open. You start out in the Home tab. In all of Apple's store apps, there are tabs across the bottom, which, when double tapped, expose different areas. In this case, from left to right, they are: Home, Library, Book Store, Audiobooks, and Search. At the top of the screen, there is an action area whose content changes based on the tab you have selected.
    There are two approaches to finding specific books:
    The first is to look in the Book Store tab. Turn the rotor to where it says Headings and flick down to advance through sections. The Top Charts section always contains one or more of these guides. Specifically, you want to find the Top Charts Free heading. Next, flick right to have the available books read out to you. You'll likely come to a See All button before finding the guide. Double tap this and then flick right through the revealed expanded chart of the most popular free books. You will almost certainly come across the iPhone User Guide or the guide for your iPad or iPod Touch. Apple is very consistent with its book names for these. When you find the correct user guide, double tap on that button to bring up the entry for that particular book. The entry will include the title, price, author, and other information including a book description. To acquire the book, start at the top left of the screen and continue to flick right. Listen for a button that will say "get". This guide is free, so there is no price. Double tap on the Get button to signal your intention to get the book. It will then require you to double tap the button a second time to confirm you want the book. Next, you will be asked for your Apple account password. If you have enabled Touch or Face ID, this may also be used to authorize purchases. Acquiring free items works in the same way as purchases, but no money is necessary to complete the process.
    A second approach is to choose the Search tab. After double tapping the Search tab, touch the top left of the screen and flick right. You'll come to an edit field where you can input one or more terms to search for. Double tap this to indicate your intention to type in that area. VoiceOver will say "is editing". A keyboard has now appeared on the screen, and you may type text into it. Feel for the desired letters and enter your device name such as iPhone, followed by a space, followed by the words "user guide". When finished, find the Search button at the very bottom-right corner of the screen. Because you're in an edit field, the tabs are not shown. Once you double tap the Search button, your device will execute the search. Touch the top left of the screen and flick right. You should quickly come to the appropriate user guide. As before, double tap the title to go to the book entry. Find and double tap the Get button. Follow the rest of the purchase procedure to acquire the guide. It will then be downloaded into your library.
    To read your guide, find and double tap on the Library tab. Touch the top left of your screen, and then flick right until you come to the title of the user guide. It will be the only book in your collection. Double tap on the title to open the book itself. You are now in "book-reading mode". The action area at the top left of the screen below the status bar has buttons to help you navigate your book. The button at the top left is Library, and it will exit your book, returning you to your library. Flicking right once gets you to the Table of Contents button. Double tap this to browse through the sections, flicking right to scroll through them in order. Double tap on the section of the guide that interests you. Had you kept flicking right, the Search button would let you search for keywords to quickly find areas of particular interest. Once you've selected a section, double tap on its link to be taken to it. Feel slowly downward from the top of the screen until you come to text such as the name of the section you've chosen. At that point, using two fingers slightly spaced apart, flick them downward together on the screen to start your book reading continuously. Use a two-finger single tap anywhere on the screen to pause or resume continuous reading. Using the rotor, you can also read by character, word, line, etc. This can be useful to determine how things are spelled.
Setting Up Your Device Blind:
In an ideal world, there will be someone who is trusted, knowledgeable, and helpful to make setting up your device easier. Entering information correctly is important during the process, and this can be nerve-wracking for inexperienced users. Be assured that it is quite possible to complete the entire setup process while totally blind. There is an increasingly likely possibility that you will have to set up your device from scratch by yourself. Provided that you remain calm and exercise patience, it is absolutely possible to set up your device right out of the box all by yourself without the need for eyesight. While writing this section, I did this with my iPad to make certain I would walk you through the process correctly. Posthumous thanks to John Morgan are definitely in order. Having a device available that I can initialize and set up repeatedly while writing about the process on my iPhone was incredibly useful.
    Make yourself comfortable. It is very helpful if you can be within range of a Wi-Fi network you are allowed to make use of. Presuming you have cellular data capability, a cellular network is another option, but Wi-Fi is strongly recommended in case you need to install operating system updates or any such thing. Sit somewhere close enough to a power outlet so that you can use your device while it is charging. Before we begin, plug the device into the power brick. For some devices, you will find the power brick has its prongs folded into itself. The prongs need to pivot into their open position, which you can accomplish easily with a finger. Next, attach the cable to the power brick. You'll find a small port on the power brick opposite to where the extended prongs are. Plug the larger end of the cable that came with your device into this port. Next, plug the other end into the small port on your device. It's a small slot, typically located on the bottom edge at the very centre of its length. You're now ready to plug the power brick into your electrical outlet as you would any other appliance.
    You may have initial trouble distinguishing the two ends of more modern charging cables. Thanks to their increased charging speed, you're likely to have either a USB-C to USB-C cable with current iPhones, or a Lightning to USB-C cable for slightly older ones. The oldest iPhones will have Lightning to USB-A style cables. The USB-C end of the newer cables is nearly as small as the Lightning end. However, it's still possible to tell the difference by touch. Also, it's impossible to put the wrong end into your device or the charging brick. The USB-C end is noticeably thicker, and you can feel a small gap between the long edges of the tip by running your finger over it. This plugs into the small slot in the charging brick. Meanwhile, the Lightning end, which goes into the port on your iPhone, has a smooth feel when you run your finger over the tip. A USB-A cable end is noteably larger and square with a thicker gap across the end which goes into the power brick or USB-A port. 
    Once you've plugged it in, be patient, as it should now be turning on and booting up. Assuming you're in a quiet place, you'll hear a short "bing" sound. If your device supports haptic feedback, you'll also feel a small pulse of vibration at the same time you hear the sound. This means the device is on and knows that it's charging. You may need to wait a short while longer, perhaps half a minute, before the device is ready. It may start saying "hello" in different languages. Either way, after this wait, it should be ready for you to begin the setup process.
    Now that you're physically ready, let's prepare you mentally. You should be ready to spend at least half an hour, possibly as much as an hour, but certainly no more than that. Don't do this when you're in any kind of a hurry. Also, it's important that you don't panic if you make a mistake. You can always use the Back button at the top left of the screen to go back to the prior step. Additionally, there is a Delete key on the onscreen keyboard. Feel around the bottom right of the screen until you find it. Keep your finger on it, and then tap anywhere on the screen with another finger to remove a character you didn't intend to enter. There are around fifteen steps, but some of them are just to read and then continue past screens containing essential information. You are allowed to skip steps, including those related to security measures. However, barring special circumstances, I strongly recommend that people go through all steps. You will then end up in the most secure and best possible starting position. There may be additional steps specific to the features and capabilities of your particular device that I haven't covered. These will be explained by your device during the process. For more details on security features such as Face ID, see the section on security later in this guide. You should also read the earlier Portion of this Quick Start section, so you understand typing basics, etc. Are you ready? Then let's get started.
1. Turn on VoiceOver. To achieve this, find the Power button located on its own along the edge opposite or above the two volume buttons. Quickly click this small sliver-like button three times. You should then hear something spoken, most likely the Back button or the currently active language.
2. You should now be at the point where you need to select the language, country, and region you wish to operate in. It will likely default to the most common language wherever you are. In my case, this is thankfully English, as I know only halting French. To select an option, tap it twice quickly, or hold a finger on the option while tapping once elsewhere on the screen with another finger. Do this for any further options as we proceed. Once the language is set, flick right, and you should either come to a place to select your country, or else find a Continue button that will take you to where that is. Once you've told your device where you are, proceed to the next step.
3. The next order of business is to join a Wi-Fi network. Flick right through the list of detectable networks and tap twice quickly on the one you want. You will then be asked for the password to join that network, presuming one is needed. Type this in.
4. You should then come to an information screen all about Apple's stance on privacy. It explains what Apple uses your information for and allows you to access further information about this if you desire. Read this by flicking right to proceed through sections. When finished, find the Continue button.
5. Next, you will be asked to set up whatever biometric security option your device has. In the case of my iPad, this was Touch ID. Meanwhile, on my iPhone XR, it was Face ID. Go through the process and keep in mind that you can always do it again later once you're finished setting up your device. If you feel nervous, you can always skip this step. Flick right, and you'll find an option to do this.
6. You will now be asked to create a passcode to keep your device secure. This is typically a six-digit number. However, you can find options to change the requirements for this passcode by flicking right. You will need to enter in your chosen number twice, which makes certain that it is what you intend. Pick a number that you will remember, since you'll need it to unlock your device, among other things. Think of it like the key to your house.
7. Next, it's time to create your Apple account. Simply fill in the form, providing all the information requested here. If you prefer, you need not use an email address specially created for you by Apple. You can use an email address you already have. Any information from Apple will be sent there. I use my Gmail address. When you select a password, pick one that you will remember, rather than one that's impossible to guess. You need to be able to remember this and enter it whenever you're asked. Keep it written down in a handy location if you need to.
8. Now that you've created your Apple account, it's time to select some preferred settings. These involve such things as using Siri. Please remember that you can always change your mind about any decision you make. After setup is complete, go into Settings, and you'll be able to make different choices if you wish.
9. It will now be time to set up Apple Pay. If you wish, you can skip this step. However, setting up Apple Pay by adding a credit or bank card will then allow you to obtain apps from the app store, among many other things.
10. At this point, you'll be asked whether to allow sharing of audio recording to improve Siri. This lets Apple employees hear your commands and teach Siri how to respond better.
11. The next step explains about screen time. You need not worry about this for the moment, so find the Continue button and proceed.
12. You will now be asked if you want to share information with app developers and Apple. This is not personal information, but is information gathered about how an app is used to improve its functionality.
13. You must now choose whether you want a light or dark appearance. Choosing "dark" may extend battery life, but will make no difference to a totally blind user beyond that.
14. At this point, you will go through a series of screens that each explain gestures required on devices without Home buttons. These gestures are vital, and you should pay close attention to the information here. Proceed through these screens until you reach the final step.
15. You may be asked to install a more recent version of the operating system than the one your device was shipped with. If this is the case, you should take the time to do this. Your initial experience of your device will be as current and secure as possible.
16. You have now reached a screen that welcomes you to your device. Double tap the Get Started button. You will be taken to the home screen. Congratulations! You have completed the setup process. 

Acknowledgements:
First and foremost, my profound posthumous thanks are given to John Ravenhill Morgan. Every so often, you meet someone who stands out as truly remarkable. John Morgan was a philanthropist who spent his years of retired life helping blind and visually impaired people in many ways. I was deeply inspired by his attitude of generosity and constant cheerfulness. When he wanted an opinion on a new piece of technology, he would frequently call on me. I was honoured to call him a friend over many years. Thanks to his financial aid, I was able to acquire an iPad. This let me invest the time required to become familiar with the differences of app layout and best approaches when using iPads as opposed to iPhones. As a result, this guide will be a much more complete exploration of these two methods of engaging with the iOS ecosystem from a totally blind perspective. It was frequently because of his financial assistance that I was able and willing to purchase some of the more expensive apps in order to use them and write about them in this guide. You'll find the results of his ongoing encouragement and aid sprinkled all through this document. Sadly, he passed away in July of 2019. I had so looked forward to presenting him with the direct result of his kindness toward me and others. In the end, I find closure and peace through completing this project and making it freely available.
    This guide is the direct result of the need for it, which I eventually came to perceive, plus the generosity that I've encountered in my journey attempting to master iOS and its ecosystem. Thanks are certainly due to my parents, Dolores and Brian Feir. Whenever I've needed a pair of working eyes, time and patience, they've always been willing to step in. Also, for her tremendous patience and support as I've worked on this project, I thank my wife Sara Feir. I couldn't ask for a better sounding board for ideas and frustrations. A lifelong friend, Stephen Murgaski, was also crucial in this area. Especially when it came to playing devil's advocate for my various notions.
    Thanks are also due to people connected to the Living Blindfully podcast and community. They fundraised and gifted me an iPhone 16 Pro, which has let me experience what has so far emerged of Apple Intelligence. I couldn't have upgraded to an iPhone Pro while still paying off my perfectly serviceable iPhone 15 until a year or longer after this guide was published. I had planned to draw upon other people's experiences with Apple Intelligence and explain things as best I could from the details I could gather. Jonathan Mosen thought that I would write a better book if I could draw from my own direct experience. For that, I needed an iPhone Pro to make the most of all the new features. He decided to start a fundraiser. I went to sleep with low expectations knowing how pretty much everyone was struggling economically these days. I thought that perhaps, over a couple of months, enough could be raised. Around eighty percent of blind people are unemployed. The next day, I woke up and was utterly stunned to find that they were closing down the fundraiser having gotten sufficient funds for the purpose. It took less than twelve hours as near as I can figure. For weeks afterwards, I continued to get messages from a good eighty people at least who would have contributed had they known about the fundraiser. That moral support was also quite validating. Having one's efforts translate into a tangible and useful benefit was a very humbling and profoundly moving experience. It vindicates me in my belief that people do indeed appreciate what is given freely. I will treasure this iPhone for as long as it functions. To make the most of this generosity, I will do a fourth edition of this book sooner than I might otherwise have. This will maximize how much of the benefits of experience I can share with you before this iPhone can't keep up with future developments. The slowly emerging transformational features of Apple Intelligence is my chief concern here. After a stumbling start, Apple is likely going to learn rapidly from its failure. I expect rapid advances over the next couple of years.
    I could never have justified spending on an iPhone Pro given my current lifestyle and limited income. Beyond Apple Intelligence, this has allowed me to experience other aspects such as Lidar, which can only be found on Pro iPhones. You'll find my explanations and conclusions in a section called Live Recognition.
    It was also useful to bounce ideas off of people who were less experienced with the use of their iOS devices. Key people who cheerfully filled that role were Paul Kitchin and Joann Hardy Laframboise. I missed the very beginning of both of their journeys with iOS devices. Joann had already figured quite a bit out on her own before we began to communicate. Paul, my father-in-law, had already gotten his first iPhone before my wife Sara and I had gotten together. However, in each case, I was able to get a good sense of what they struggled with and what was easier for them to master early on.
    The entire team behind the Kelly and Company show are owed my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to be a regular contributor to the show. Kelly MacDonald, Ramya Amuthan, Matt Agnew, and Jeff Ryman as well as numerous others have built something marvellous to lighten long afternoons. Providing a framework for so many community members and experts to reach blind and visually impaired Canadians in such style is no easy task. The preparation work I did for nearly two hundred and seventy segments has proved instrumental in building this guide and keeping the project going. Pretty much all of that exploration, enjoyment, and work is done on my iPhone.
    Jonathan Mosen is a man who has worn many hats in life. He is known far and wide for writing books that help blind people make use of various technology including iOS devices. His iOS Without the Eye series of books, which emerged while I worked on this guide, helped me quickly become familiar with what was new in each version of iOS. Those books saved me a tremendous amount of time and explorational effort. Even more than the books, Jonathan is owed thanks for his constant willingness to share his knowledge when asked. His efforts to help others in the worldwide blind community have been a tremendous inspiration over many years.
    I owe a large debt of gratitude to the staff and membership of the AppleVis website and community. Since before my journey with iOS began, your collective efforts to help each other and share your discoveries drew me onward. You were my beacon, haven from confusion, and a pathway to being able to share in helping others. The Be My Eyes foundation stepped in to save this priceless resource from closure. Applevis is now on a far safer footing. May this enterprise long continue guiding us all into whatever wonders Apple throws at us next.
    Many thanks are also due to the CNIB. When the pandemic struck, they went virtual. I've been honoured to participate as both a guest and presenter in several of their virtual groups conducted via Zoom. Thanks for all of your questions. They've helped make this third edition of the guide a better one.
    Similar thanks are also due to the Canadian Council of the Blind. The GTT Visionaries have welcomed me as guest and presenter on many ocasions while the third edition was in progress. This includes teaching the Unseen Touchscreen course in a series of regular monthly cessions. Conducted on Zoom, these cessions are freely available to people across Canada. They attend the lectures, which are recorded and distributed as part of the Canadian Council of the Blind podcast. Following the lectures and during an additional unrecorded live cession, participants can ask questions. This process has been instrumental in improving the book.
    Also, my local Mississauga chapter of the CCB has been very welcoming and gracious. I've been honoured to fill a regular slot in their monthly schedule of meetings to host iOS For Us classes where I share what I've learned about thriving as a blind user of an iPhone. It has been wonderful to welcome new members and experience a group which has stuck together during such trying times.
    Finally, a hearty thanks to all who have enriched the online world that I inhabit with podcasts, resources, and so many fascinating conversations. Together, we leave a truly astounding legacy of thought and creation. I'm honoured to be a part of it all.

Changes in the Third Edition:
Hello, Reader. Welcome to the third edition of this guide. Once again, there have been a great many changes. This small section will point readers to the larger, more important updates dealing with new capabilities and circumstances. If you're new to this guide and itching to get going, I would invite you to skip ahead to the introduction and dive right in. This section is to help those of you who are familiar with the prior edition who want to minimize reading material you already know.
    The app store expedition section has been removed. Keeping it maintained was taking a lot of work and I decided that it's better to simply have people find apps discussed in their appropriate sections. Be on the lookout for some newly discovered treasures.
    Thanks to the generosity of many readers, I was given an iPhone 16 Pro. This has enabled me to experience the full suite of live recognition features. Formerly a part of the Magnifyer app, these have now been incorporated into VoiceOver. Live recognition features have their own rotor and may also be accessed via a four finger triple tap. They detect and describethings in the real world using Lidar and the iPhone's camera system. Readers will find a full section dedicated to live recognition.
    Developments with Apple Intelligence have proceeded slower than was initially expected. However, readers will find a section which combines infrmation about Siri as well as Apple Intelligence as it currently stands. I expect that this section will be substantially expanded in the fourth edition of this guide.
    Other reorganization includes moving the section answerring why I wrote this guide nearer to the end. I think this makes the flow better. Other sections in that general vacinity include what used to be a subsection about the economics of owning an iPhone. There's a new section about how to live well with an iPhone. Another often requested addition was a small section on avoiding scams. I hope people find that helpful. The subsection in the health and mental wellnesss section having to do with the special circumstances during the pandemic was removed.

Introduction
On the first of February 2011, I took what felt like a bit of a gamble. My mother had broken her cellphone. She needed a replacement that was fairly basic and easy to use. I had a phone that would suit her. It had raised number buttons on it so that I was able to dial numbers with it. That was the whole reason I had bought it. However, all of its other features were utterly inaccessible to me. She would make much better use of it, presuming there was a more accessible option out there for me. I had previously been given an accessible cellphone designed for blind people that had physical buttons and synthetic speech. This had let me send and receive texts, use the address book, and perform other functions common to earlier cellphones. Unfortunately, it stopped working rather suddenly and proved impossible to get repaired. The phone I was now planning to donate to my mother had been purchased in a hurry. When your phone is what you use to let people into your apartment and you mainly shop online, having a working phone is about as essential as things get. I was happy to have something with a raised keypad. I never would have expected that two years after that frantic purchase, there would, indeed, be a more accessible phone that blind people would be raving about. It had only one button on its front face.
    From what I had heard, the iPhone, despite having a flat buttonless touchscreen, was nonetheless the new, amazingly affordable, accessible option for blind people.
    On a fixed income, the only way I could afford this gadget was to sign a three-year contract with the phone carrier I still use today. Unlike other options, that contract would cost me the same as any other sighted person who bought an iPhone. I wouldn't have to pay anything extra to make it accessible for me. That was an absolutely monumental selling point. Provided I could really cope with the touchscreen effectively, I'd gain some tremendous capabilities if what my friends and online acquaintances had told me was true. I had no real cause to doubt them. They're a fabulous and thoughtful bunch of people. It was just that the kind of stories they told of having wonderful experiences on a touchscreen, despite being totally blind, seemed so out there.
    Was it really possible to quickly answer a phone call on a device where you couldn't feel the right button? How on Earth would you type in a password while browsing the web? How quickly could you really do things competently when time was of the essence?
    This was such a big change in how blind people did things that signing the contract was a tad scary. Before reaching this point, I had prepared as best I could. I had learned about the still new AppleVis community formed by blind people who had made this leap of faith a year or more before me. Having acquired a book of instructions written to help blind people start using these things effectively, I felt reasonably prepared. I signed the contract and was handed my new iPhone 4. Lifting it, I was surprised at how light and thin yet solid it felt. It was just as I had been told it would be; a flat, thin and completely smooth rectangular slab. To people with sight, I presumed it looked somehow fancy and sophisticated. For me, it felt rather like one of those smooth small cup coasters that your drink all too easily slips right off if you don't set it down carefully. Had I just done something beyond daft?
    The salesman and my father got the initial setup completed for me. I found out later that even in those early days, I could have done this by myself and that it would have talked right from the start. I was then able to tell them how to turn on VoiceOver. This was a screen reader which Apple had included free in iOS to make it possible for blind people to use their smartphones. My father understood that the iPhone had a screen reader that would make it possible for me to use. In contrast, I don't think the salesman actually knew about VoiceOver. Perhaps, he thought someone who could see would be around whenever I needed to use it. When I started figuring out the very basics standing at that shop counter, the realization that the iPhone was talking to me about what I was touching utterly amazed him.
    Gaining real competence took a couple of weeks of trying out various apps and learning good technique performing the various gestures. At the start, I sometimes declined calls I meant to accept and made other mistakes. However, it was apparent after less than an hour of use that I would actually be able to master this smartphone and use it efficiently. It was just a matter of practice and time. Thus began my journey to unimaginable capability, accomplishments, and endless amusement. All of this to be gained from a small flat slab easily pocketed or held in one hand.
    If you had told me fifteen years ago that I would one day walk around with a flat rectangular device in my pocket that could tell me where I was, identify groceries using pictures I took with a built-in camera, let me play games I never dreamed would be accessible, could read printed pages in mere seconds, and allow me to carry over a thousand books in my pocket, I would have laughed long and hard at you. The idea would have struck me as utterly preposterous. Even after a year of owning my iPhone 4, I never would have imagined that I'd one day be sitting on my apartment balcony on a warm summer afternoon writing a guide using an iPhone 7 rather than the laptop sitting unused on my desk mere metres away. For over five years now, that computer has spent most of its time in a desk drawer on the off chance I'd need it for something. The iPhone 16 Pro I'm now using to write the third edition of this book packs far more computing power. It has, in fact, replaced my laptop in everyday life. As a blind person, I have no use for a screen in front of a keyboard. A completely detached pocket computer with a touchscreen, which lets me make use of a keyboard when it's actually advantageous, has proven far more portable and efficient for me.
    Until you experience these things, it seems like something from science fiction. The last fifteen years have totally changed my perspective about what's not only possible, but affordable thanks to technology that's truly designed for everyone. The iPhone, which I never go anywhere without, has steadily increased in capability as new accessible apps are created to take advantage of the technology housed within. It is undeniably the most versatile and downright useful piece of technology I've ever had.
    I invite you to tap into over a decade and a half of my own experience plus that of many other blind people. Let me be your guide into a whole new paradigm of connective, powerful, and affordable accessibility. Through this free guide, I hope to make your journey to competence using iOS devices much easier, less costly, and more enjoyable than my own was. Perhaps, I can add a measure of the delight that some of my stumbles cost me as I mastered my iPhone.
    Make no mistake. This is not a manual. Those valuable documents are written with people in a heaping hurry in mind. Others have already written manuals about using an iPhone. I haven't set out to reinvent the wheel. Think of this more like a traveler's journal. A guidebook written for people with time to explore and have fun wandering through a new place. I focus just as much on giving you a sense of what's awaiting your possible interest as on explaining how to get around. I view both as being equally important. Rather than a crash course, this is more of a leisurely tour given by someone who deeply appreciates what he's found and wants others to share in that enjoyment. Hopefully, you'll never find yourself reading through long stretches of instructions without having an idea why you might actually want to know how to do something. I want my readers to have a good sense of what's possible for them as early in the learning process as can be managed. You, my readers, should feel comfortable going in your own direction and pursuing your own interests long before reading more than a small fraction of this document.
    I haven't written this thinking that people will read it all the way through like you'd read a novel. Instead, I've written this with the presumption that people will skip over what doesn't interest them at the moment and read sections out of order. Maybe, you have already heard a lot about the Apple ecosystem, and someone has told you what the buttons on your device are. If this is the case, you can skip right to the section on VoiceOver and get cracking. Perhaps you've heard about an app that your friends and family all want you to use. Once you're comfortable with VoiceOver and have the basics down, skip right to the section about the app store and grab the apps you want. Perhaps, you already know how to navigate iOS and simply wonder what interesting things I've found. There are hopefully some treasures here worthy of your attention too. I've included numerous lists of podcasts, apps, books, games, and even musical favourites. I don't consider such things to be fluff. They've taught me things, brightened my days, and given me motivation and reason to use my iPhone to the fullest. I hope they will give newcomers to this digital world somewhere to start enjoying. You'll also find other meandering asides, such as when I discuss social media. Rather than just giving you the bare bones of how to use various apps, I try to illuminate the perils, pleasures, and pitfalls that I've found while using social media of various sorts. When I discuss security, I tell you about the various options and also about why you should care about available options and measures taken on your behalf. I want my readers to have the best possible chance to truly thrive and become responsible considerate citizens of the online world. That requires more than just knowing how to do things with your iOS device. You need to have a sense of context to understand and choose how, why, and when you might want to engage with the online world.
    Consider this guide to be your friend, teacher, and tour guide. Turn to it whenever you get stuck, curious, or confused. You might not find coverage of exactly what you're trying to do. However, you'll almost certainly find the necessary skills discussed as well as something comparable to what you're doing. Through examples drawn from my own personal experiences, I'll help you understand why blind people have made the leap and why you also may want to. I'll take you on the incredible journey which Apple's iPhone has allowed me to travel. You will have a far better grasp of the possibilities of your device and can determine what capabilities are worth your effort to master.
    I don't presume that everyone who reads this will want to do everything with their device that I have with mine. I also don't believe I've learned anywhere near everything there is to know. Hopefully, this guide can be a steppingstone allowing you, my readers, to discover new possibilities. Bring them to my attention and share them with the quickly growing community of blind users. I'd like more blind people to be able to use these devices to help them live even more engaged lives than my own.
    There are many areas where an iOS device may be helpful that fall outside my enthusiastic interest. I have endeavoured to go beyond my areas of competence and interest to create a more helpful and comprehensive resource. When we come to areas where I feel it is warranted, I will explain where I feel less competent so that you may better judge what I say about apps and capacities available on iOS devices to get help from people better informed in these areas than I am.
    This guide has different levels of headings to help you get where you want to go. Headings at level one divide the guide into major sections. The quickstart is one such major area. So is the introduction you now read. Subsequent sections go into greater detail about iOS and your built-in screen reader, VoiceOver. Second-level headings divide major sections into subsections that focus more on important concepts, but are still a part of the overall area of interest. For example, the "rotor gesture" has its own subsection within the major section devoted to VoiceOver. Second-level headings may also serve to denote a shift of focus onto different but similar apps within a major section. Third-level headings are used to begin shorter noteworthy items within a subsection. These items precede things like detailed descriptions of a gesture, or a list of step-by-step instructions on how to perform a task within an app. Other times, third-level headings will mark places where different areas of an app or different options are discussed in detail. Things proceed in that fashion as required. The higher the level of heading, the more granular the focus will be. Those of you wanting the "how to" steps and lists should be looking for third or fourth level headings.
    You might find the order in which topics are covered to be ramshackle. This is an aspect of building the guide which I've continuously revamped and revisited. The order of major sections was carefully considered to maximize the ease and enjoyment of learning. I had several priorities which conflicted at times. This conflict increased once the very basics had been covered. Most importantly, I wanted to be certain that any foundational material needed to understand something had been presented before that topic was reached. There's no need to read the major sections in order. However, I recommend you read the sections about iOS and VoiceOver before going very far into the rest of the guide. There are many key concepts discussed in those sections that it helps to be familiar with right away before you start to explore the apps already on your device and those developed by people all over the world.
    We start out with familiarizing you with the VoiceOver screen reader and iOS so that you have a sense of what to do when we discuss other apps and capabilities in a more casual fashion rather than complete step-by-step instructions. Beyond that, I feel strongly that it's important to convey the staggering opportunities for fun and entertainment which these devices open up to us as soon as it's possible for beginners to explore them. That's why I included the "Surface of Possibilities" section giving people a tour of the apps present on my iPhone. It can be found before the section about VoiceOver. Because it is relatively easy to use and offers many rewards for listeners, you'll find the section about enjoying music on your device much earlier than other sections devoted to audio entertainment. The section on accessible games is, therefore, found soon after the section describing the app store. It's essential to find ways to have fund or be rewarded for your learning efforts as soon as is practical and safe. Too often, blind people are introduced to technology as a means of work. This can leave them resenting the technology rather than enjoying it. That simply won't happen on my watch. Other areas of entertainment are positioned to break up more serious groups of topics. Also, where it makes sense to do so, related major sections are placed one after another. These thoughts were all in mind as I came up with the order of presentation.
    This guide attempts to make learning about the iOS operating system more manageable and less overwhelming by breaking up the experience into constituent parts. Many aspects of it, such as the app store, Siri, Settings, etc., have their own separate sections. This will hopefully allow you to focus on each aspect as you need to, and not feel that you must grasp everything all at once before starting to use your device in earnest. I think that it's important to start using your device to pursue your own entertainments and interests as soon as possible. Long before I knew much about iOS, I was already buying apps, taking notes, answering phone calls, setting reminders, and checking the weather.
    There is another absolutely crucial piece to the puzzle of how blind people can maximize the benefit and enjoyment they get from iOS devices. Finding the apps that are accessible to blind people among the countless apps available can be a discouraging hunt. Particularly for beginners. The app store has no really good mechanism for flagging apps that offer VoiceOver support. What's more, app developers often don't have much of an advertising budget or know where to spread the word that they have created apps that are accessible to blind people. While I can't wave my magic wand and fix these ongoing circumstances, I can, and have, taken what actions I'm able to in this guide to mitigate them. To this end, I have used some third-party apps as examples when explaining how some concepts work where this makes sense. The use of these apps will be thoroughly described and explained. Many sections of this guide are completely about third-party apps which are fully accessible. Games are a perfect example of this, as none are included with iOS itself to await your pleasure right from day one. If any interest you, they will be available in the app store, unless they have been retired from the store since this guide was written. This absolutely will happen over time. However, any techniques discussed will be applicable to other alternative apps.
    As improvements are made to iOS and various apps, the precise methods for achieving things may change. As new versions of iOS appear, the overall concepts taught in this guide should remain largely valid. However, some specific steps and methods may no longer apply as improvements are made. More lasting than the "how-to" are the basic possibilities, capabilities, and concepts that iOS devices make use of. Those tend to remain the same. Similarly to my first Personal Power guide, I hope that this also stands the test of time, remaining largely useful years from when it was completed.
    Not all change in the world of iOS is positive. New versions of iOS quite often contain problems, commonly known as bugs, which may take time to fix, presuming they ever are. iOS 18 has proved to contain a good many serious bugs. Despite a flurry of updates since its release, many issues remain unresolved, including some that effect the VoiceOver screen reader. In this guide, I describe how features are supposed to work, but sometimes may not, due to these glitches. The spellcheck rotor feature was a personally painful example as I concluded work on the first edition of this guide. If you try something repeatedly and find that it doesn't work, keep in mind that you may be dealing with a bug rather than your own lack of skill or experience.
    I'm always keen to hear from my readers. Any thoughts or questions are most welcome. Email or Mastodon are the best current methods for contacting me. On Mastodon, my username is:
    @mfeir@mstdn.social
    While I still have an account on X, the service formerly known as Twitter, I rarely spend time on it.
    My email address remains unchanged. It is:

    There are times when I get numerous emails and posts on Mastodon, so please be patient. Remember that I'm doing this on my own time. Nobody paid me to produce this guide or answer questions from whoever reads it. I love to help people and will do my best to respond to everyone in timely fashion. However, there are other projects and activities in my life that also deserve my attention. As long as you remain civil and considerate of this, I'll be happy to help. However, I won't hesitate to block and report abusive behaviour. That said, I hope you enjoy the rest of this guide and look forward to encountering you online.

Your iOS Device and Accessories:
Perhaps, you've ordered a device from Apple, and the sturdy cardboard box is in your hands. If so, enjoy that unique smell that will waft out when you open it. I enjoyed this experience somewhat sooner than I had planned on during the Autumn of 2024 when I was happy to receive the iPhone 16 Pro which was purchased on my behalf by people wanting to support my efforts in writing this book. Maybe you're holding an already-used device given to you by a friend, family member, or charitable organization who think it will enrich your life as a blind person. If so, explore that flat glass surface and feel the port and sliver-like buttons found along the edges of the device. Lift it up in your hands. Get a good sense of its weight and balance. You'll be grabbing it up and handling it in all manner of circumstances.
    We begin our journey focusing on the range of hardware that runs the iOS operating system. Any iOS device will be a smooth, flat rectangular slab with minimal buttons and switches on the side, and a connecting port on the bottom edge. Past this common idea of the screen, which can become anything necessary, the similarities are less certain. Things differ depending on the processor and storage capacity, biometric security features, and other things housed within that technological sandwich of glass and aluminum you now hold.
    Right from the start, your choice of device will have potentially major ramifications on what you ultimately choose to use your iOS device for and what apps you decide to acquire for it. For many people, this section's first part will be useful right away to help select your device and understand its basic layout. Later in this section, we'll look at some accessories you may decide to acquire to maximize the usefulness of your device. Thanks to the Bluetooth capabilities built into your iPhone or iPad, there's a lot of choice in that space. In fact, there's so much choice that we'll spend more time in the section discussing these accessories than we'll spend discussing iOS devices. This is mainly because iOS devices are so very similar to each other in terms of design and overall function. From speakers to headphones to protective cases, Bluetooth keyboards, and external batteries, the variety of options is positively astounding. There's bound to be something affordable and useful to you that will enhance your overall experience.
    I have written this section hoping to help people better understand the implications of the device they might already have, or else help prospective purchasers figure out which device would best suit their needs and budget. For a more thorough grasp of what you're getting into, please also take time to read the section found later in this guide called The iOS Ecosystem. The hardware is the foundation of your experience. The digital home you build on that foundation will better suit you if you understand the economics and philosophy behind the services and software developed for this particular hardware.
    Increasingly, people are having their first experience with the constantly evolving iOS ecosystem on older second-hand devices. These are quite often still fully functional at the point when their initial owners wish to upgrade to newer devices. This further increases the uncertainty I must try to accommodate when discussing the hardware you may encounter. Recently, the CNIB has launched an initiative called Phone It Forward to encourage donating older iOS devices for blind people, so they can take advantage of the many accessible apps available. This is a wonderful thing, since it gives those who can't otherwise afford it a way into the iOS ecosystem and access to all of the many benefits this confers. I absolutely applaud this and other similar initiatives that may exist in the world. However, I am concerned that people might not understand the ramifications of being unable to update their version of the iOS operating system to the latest release once the processor chip in their device becomes too old to be supported. Past this point, your device will certainly still function. However, being unable to receive iOS updates has serious implications. Apple fixes security flaws and offers improvements to the VoiceOver screen reader along with other improvements in successive updates to the operating system. There is no way to update the capabilities of any one component separate from others. Since VoiceOver and other accessibility tools are built into that operating system, people who don't have the latest version of it will miss out on any of these often substantial improvements. The tutorial for VoiceOver which was added in iOS and iPadOS 18 is a prime example. Mastering VoiceOver is far easier if you have access to this built-in tutorial. The only exception to this is with security improvements. Apple provides updates in this area to older versions of iOS for at least a year past when the next version emerges.
    Another major consequence of being unable to update to the latest version of iOS is that app developers stop supporting older versions of iOS. Doing so takes effort and resources better spent in other ways. The older your device is, the more you'll find that your experience starts to differ from what is discussed in this guide. You'll also start to find that apps, techniques, and capabilities which owners of more modern devices take for granted won't be available to you. In particular, apps are constantly being improved and changed. You might have an app called Facebook Messenger, but your version will only be the latest which your device can support. This may be far enough behind the current version that your experience will be different from people around you.
    Being an owner and user of an iOS device puts you on a kind of economic treadmill. Presuming you like what iOS has to offer, there will eventually come a point when you'll need to upgrade to a more modern device. Generally, people upgrade their devices long before they're at the tail end of being useful. Blind recipients of donated devices will very much benefit from this tendency. Just be aware that, eventually, you'll either be tempted to upgrade your device to gain new capabilities or be forced to upgrade to a newer device when the one you have ages. More on this later.
    Before we discuss each kind of device, there are two crucial factors common to all of them that will have the most drastic consequences for your overall experience as a blind user. These are the processor your device contains as well as how much storage capacity is built in. There is no way of upgrading either of these aspects of your device short of upgrading to a newer, more capable one. You're essentially stuck with what you have onboard until you're ready and willing to upgrade to a newer device. Let's examine each of these important aspects in turn.
The Processor
The processor or "chip" inside your iOS device is what gives it computational power and speed. Don't think of it as a single component. These are systems on a chip and include a tremendous array of tiny components that allow your device to function. These include multiple processor cores which allow your device to do many things at once, often in the background, while you attend to other things. With each new model of device, Apple introduces substantially more capable chips. Beyond being simply faster and more efficient, these new processors may have new components that introduce capabilities that older chips simply won't have. For example, the A10 Fusion chip contained in the iPhone 7 introduced a multiple core approach with two high-performance cores and two high-efficiency cores that use far less power for tasks that aren't processor intensive. When I upgraded to the iPhone 7 on which the first edition of this guide was begun, I certainly noticed how much faster it was than the iPhone I used previously. It was much more capable of handling multiple tasks at once without freezes and lockups. When I upgraded to my iPhone XR, I once again noticed speed improvements as well as much better power management. The battery charge lasted substantially longer, and things happened a lot more speedily. My iPhone 15 gave me very noticeable improvements in these and other areas including object recognition. It now serves as my backup device as well as an essential tool for presenting demonstrations and reading Brailled notes. This is especially useful while my iPhone 16 Pro is used for recording or broadcasting. The performance improvement between these two phones is noticeable, but not as dramatic as when you jump forward by two or more generations of chip.
    As blind people, we won't notice the visual improvements that the graphics processing components facilitate. However, graphics are still happening on our screens or virtually as apps run. The more efficiently this can happen, the less strain the system and battery will be under. Responsiveness is something we will most certainly notice as we go about our various tasks. The A15 chips in the 2021 series of iPhones and iPads gave these devices speed and power equivalent to modern game consoles, which are some of the most capable consumer-oriented computing devices available. This facilitates augmented reality and artificial intelligence applications that are quickly emerging. The artificial intelligence capabilities have far-reaching implications when it comes to how your device responds to you with suggestions and recommendations as it learns more about your preferences and interests. These capabilities may also aid in object identification and character recognition among many other things of use to blind users. In fact, devices with modern enough processors, [A10 or better], will deploy this artificial intelligence to allow VoiceOver to describe images and make apps more accessible.
    Usually, the improvements to speed and other capabilities gained when you upgrade a single generation of processor won't bowl you over. That's because most users aren't doing things that truly push the chips in their devices to their limits. However, these changes do add up over time. When my wife Sara upgraded from her iPhone 5S to the XR she used until a few years ago, she remarked on how much faster it was. It also didn't freeze up or have apps crash anywhere near as frequently, even when many apps were running in the background. Often, improvements to the processor are felt over time in small ways. My iPhone 15 made the transition to using a USB-C port rather than Apple's proprietary Lightning port. This makes it possible to use many more accessories not specifically designed for the iPhone. Advancing one generation of chip to the A16 has made itself felt in more ways than I had any reason to expect.
    With the emergence of Apple Intelligence, the RAM or random access memory onboard your iPhone's chip has become critical to consider. To make use of any features powered by Apple Intelligence, you need a minimum 8 gb of RAM. This is different from your iPhone's storage, which we'll talk about in the next subsection. RAM is like an electronic equivalent of your short-term memory. You have a lifetime of memories in storage but can only access so much of that at a time. The RAM in your iPhone gives space for more information to be worked with at once.
    The processing cores in your iPhone's chip give it more capability to do several things at the same time. Much of this happens in the background. To handle the higher demands of Apple Intelligence, you need the short-term memory and processing capability to have what is called a large language model running and ready to smoothly jump into action when required. This takes a sizeable chunk of these resources.
    Some apps really need the capabilities of a certain generation of chip as a minimum. People with older devices simply won't be able to use these apps at all. Games and other apps designed to perform intense tasks like audio or video editing are prime candidates for this. Most apps will merely take a little more time to work on older devices. Such lag will be especially noticeable when you're doing a lot at once on older devices.
    The more modern the chip in your device is, the longer it will enable you to receive new updates and versions of the iOS operating system. Generally speaking, this will give you more time before you'll need to invest in a newer device. You pay up front for peace of mind going forward. Most major updates to iOS will make you thankful to get them as improvements to accessibility, and improvements in other areas can be quite substantial. They are all bundled into iOS itself, so you can't really forego some less desired changes.
Storage Capacity
Your iOS device will come equipped with a "solid-state drive" that lets you store apps and other data that you create or obtain. Any information stored on this drive will be available regardless of whether you are connected to the Internet via cellular data or Wi-Fi. Solid-state drives have no moving parts and are, therefore, more resistant to impact or shock damage than conventional hard drives. They also require less power. Solid-state drives are capable of finding, reading, and writing information nearly instantaneously. All of these traits make them the best choice currently available for devices like tablets and smartphones.
    There is no slot in your device for its solid-state drive. They are built in and cannot be replaced except possibly by Apple should the need arise. The customer must choose the amount of storage at the time of purchase and live with the consequences of this choice thereafter. As of mid-2025, the highest possible capacity available is 1 terabyte on the latest most expensive iPhones, or 2 terabytes on the most expensive iPad Pro. The absolute minimum is 32 GB, which is found on much older devices no longer sold by Apple. On modern iPhones still sold today, the minimum would be 128 GB. The same would hold for iPads. Upgrading to the next level of storage typically adds around $100 US to the cost of a new device.
    These lower amounts may not sound like a lot compared to the storage available on even the cheapest laptops. However, you'll be surprised how far this will go when combined with Cloud-based services. The whole idea with these devices is that you're always connected to inexpensive Cloud storage and the Internet. You may therefore simply retrieve information when needed. In practice, due to the cost of cellular data, it is wise to have more storage onboard your device than the minimum possible. Many people I know started thinking they would only use their device for checking emails or browsing the web. Within the first month, they were doing far more than that and having to delete music or take other measures to manage the space on their devices. Personally, I much prefer music, audio dramas, books, and other digital possessions stored on my device ready for use even when unable to connect to the Internet. As a result, I often had to choose what took up space on my iPhone 7 with its 128 GB of storage capacity. I could certainly cope with less capacity, but wouldn't enjoy having less storage on a future device. In fact, I invested the extra money to have the next higher level of storage, which effectively doubled the amount to 256 GB on my iPhone XR. My current iPhone 15 has the maximum amount of storage I could obtain without investing in a more expensive Pro model. That is 512 GB. I have already put most of this capacity to good use. Now, I'm able to keep substantially more audiobooks, music, and other resources onboard and ready at all times. For the iPhone 16 Pro given to me, I requested and was thankful to get that same amount of storage. Given my personal needs, this means that I've escaped having to really decide what kind of overall use I put my iPhone versus other devices towards. I can now keep the bulk of what I digitally own and value the most onboard, and shuffle things in and out far less frequently than ever before. That lowers the amount of data I use and eliminates the likelihood of incurring high data costs while away from home. I'm also more likely to have digital resources I would like to be able to access even while offline. Those who may have been given older iPhones which have less than 64 GB of storage will have to consider whether they want to do most of their audiobook reading on their device or whether they want their music collection on tap ready to go. While using her iPhone 5S, my wife Sara frequently found that she didn't have enough storage space for everything she wanted onboard, such as apps and audiobooks. Thankfully, she has plenty of space on her iPhone 13 and shouldn't need to worry about storage capacity very often at all based on how she currently uses it.
    A major upgrade that was introduced in iOS 13 is a far more robust capability to handle files and use external storage with your iOS device. These include flash drives, SD cards, file servers, etc. It is possible now to integrate these external file repositories into the Files app, where they'll act similarly to iCloud drive storage. This is similar to how Windows computers can access files on SD cards, flash drives, etc, and treat them all the same, allowing for easy copying and movement. These external storage methods can relieve some issues around not having enough onboard storage. However, they'll be potentially less convenient than if you had invested in higher onboard storage. For the truly tech-savvy among us, there are ways to set up personal cloud servers which may well be just as convenient as virtual cloud space. You'd still want some iCloud space to back up your iPhone, but wouldn't need to pay for a higher cost iCloud Plus subscription.
Common Aspects of iOS Devices
All of these devices are rectangular. Some older devices have a round indented button near the bottom of the touchscreen called a Home button. These buttons are actually sensitive, small round button-like areas that don't press in. However, tactile feedback is given through a vibration motor in the device that gives the sensation of pressing a button. It can take a bit of getting used to.
    Devices that lack one of these virtual buttons will make use of cameras and sensors located behind the top of your device's touchscreen to scan your face. This is how they will verify who you are to unlock or approve purchases, among other uses. At least one type of iPAD now features a Touch ID sensor integrated into the action button on the device.
    IOS devices are all quite thin but rigid structures composed mainly of special glass and metal. They can break if dropped. The first thing I obtain for a new iOS device is a case to protect it from accidental falls. The very first day my father owned an iPad, he stood in the driveway of my brother's house and tried to take a picture of his grandchildren. He accidentally dropped the iPad on the driveway, and it cracked. It was the first time they saw their grandfather cry. Thankfully, Apple was wonderfully kind and replaced the broken iPad at no cost. It could have been an expensive object lesson. I recount the story above so others may learn from it. Your iOS device will find its way into your daily life in countless ways. Do yourself a massive favour and protect your investment. It's painfully easy to overestimate our ability to be careful. While I have yet to seriously damage an iPhone by physical impact, I have unintentionally knocked and dropped each of my iPhones onto hard floor or ground. I have also bumped it against walls, door frames, and other hard objects. And then, there's water and other liquids that are even more dangerous to the wellbeing of iPhones. As blind and visually impaired people, we are even more vulnerable to such accidents than the average user. Due to the sacrifice in sound clarity which waterproof cases demand, I have more sympathy for people who choose to rely on the water resistance built into their device. You will notice a muffling effect which, especially for people with hearing loss, can be troublesome when not using headsets or earbuds. I have reached a point where I selected a case for my current iPhone which doesn't offer water protection beyond resistance to small amounts such as raindrops. I wouldn't worry about holding it while in a rain shower. However, I would very much worry if it fell into a full sink or was in the path of a spilled large drink. 
    Along their edges, iOS devices have short volume buttons right near each other on one side. Above these is either a small Action button on modern devices, or else a small rocker switch that allows you to mute the device. The Action button is capable of serving many different functions when it is pressed and briefly held in. Along the top or the opposite edge of the volume buttons, you'll find another similar button called the screen lock or power button. It is primarily used to turn on or lock your device while it's on. It can also be used to perform other operations not done via the touchscreen. Holding this button in for around half a second can be used to summon Siri, a digital assistant. Clicking it three times quickly can perform an accessibility related shortcut which might activate the VoiceOver screen reader for example. These buttons feel like thick slivers that protrude ever so slightly outward from the edges.
    A short distance above the bottom of the right edge of iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models, you'll find a smooth flat area slightly raised above the rest of the side. This is a camera control. It is sensitive to touch as well as pressure. People can use this to take pictures with their iPhone held in one hand. It can also summon visual intelligence which can describe an answer questions about objects in view of the camera.
    The bottom edge of your device features a small slot where a charging cable is plugged in. On substantially older devices, there will also be a jack for EarPods or other headsets or microphones. These disappeared after the 6th generation iPhones. You'll also find grilled sections on the very left and right of the bottom edge where a speaker and microphone are located.
    Other than that, the rest of your device will be a flat, featureless surface. It is a touchscreen. Tiny sensors under the surface can tell where one or more fingers are touching it. This lets you do a surprising number of things.
iPods, iPhones, and iPads: What's the Difference
It all comes down to capabilities and physical size. iPhones are a range of smaller, more portable and in some ways, such as having built-in cellular data and GPS, more capable devices. They can fit comfortably inside a pocket. iPads, on the other hand, are larger tablets whose main attraction is a substantially larger touchscreen display. The Pro line of iPads offer significantly more computing power than iPhones. However, the cheaper kind of iPad, simply called "iPad," offers a slightly less powerful chip than comes in mid-range iPhones.
    Being connected to the Internet is a major strength of these devices. If you choose the iPhone, you will be able to connect using your cellular data. iPads may be equipped with cellular capability for a higher price. However, they can't then be used as overly large cellular phones. You would pay for a data plan and use the data for working online while out of range of Wi-Fi connections.
    Having the capability to connect to cellular networks is simply built into every model of iPhone from the start. Some people will buy iPhones and then only use them while connected to Wi-Fi. This is certainly a more portable approach and adds the benefit of built-in GPS. However, the abilities you gain by investing in a data and phone plan are substantial. Being able to communicate and use apps that leverage online services and artificial intelligence from wherever you are is absolutely revolutionary and of immense benefit to blind people.
    Overall, any kind of iOS device allows you to use the same apps. Newer devices without Home buttons have some different gestures and uses for the Action button that you'll need to master. There should be no major cause for concern that your choice will disallow you from using apps. However, there are cases where a special version of the app was developed for the iPad to fully take advantage of its additional resources or display size. A case in point is Fantastical 3, the calendar and reminder app I used for many years. The majority of available apps are universal, meaning they'll work on either device, but they may change how information is displayed depending on which device is used. Which option is best for you will depend on what your abilities and needs are. Let's explore the differences and advantages of each kind of device.
iPods:
These are no longer sold or supported.
iPhones:
These devices are by far the most famous. They are fully featured pocket computers that also happen to be cellular phones. In addition to Wi-Fi, they can also access the Internet using cellular data. They have GPS and other sensors built in, such as accelerometers. They are also equipped with very capable front and rear cameras. There is currently a wide array of iPhones available from Apple, ranging in price from around $400 Canadian to well over $1,000 for an absolutely cutting-edge, top-end iPhone.
    Many people acquire their iPhones through different cellular carrier companies that subsidize the up-front cost by offering contracts. In Canada, these typically span two years and spread the payment for the device out over that time. While this ultimately costs more money than purchasing an unlocked device outright, it can prove easier for people on tighter budgets who find it challenging to have enough money at one time. It's very much like buying a house. By the time you finish paying for it, the value will have gone down regarding how long it will remain a viable digital home.
iPads:
The basic idea behind an iPad or other tablet is that it's a sheet of glass that can be whatever you need it to be. It can show you the page of a book you want to read, become a word processor, display photos, let you watch movies, or be your portable game system. Anything you might want. Rather than paying a bill each month for cellular service and data, blind people hoping to use iOS apps might choose to pay for an iPad and use it with Wi-Fi in their homes or elsewhere. This is certainly a less-costly option, as the only expense incurred beyond Digital goods and services purchased is when you eventually wish to upgrade to a newer device.
    If you take this route, you give up a degree of portability and gain a larger display that won't be as advantageous as it can be for sighted people. This is particularly true if you have spatial intelligence difficulties like I do. For me, it is far easier to conceptualize where everything is and develop a good degree of muscle memory using my iPhone's much smaller display surface. Due to these difficulties, as well as the pandemic, I decided to give away my iPAD soon after completing the first edition of this guide. Other than allowing me to learn about the implications of this larger size, I simply found that I naturally gravitated to using the iPHONE for everything I did. The people who I gave the iPad to could see and thus take far better advantage of the larger screen, which so confounded my gestures and sense of orientation. For others, this larger size may prove to be advantageous even without sight. For example, entering Braille characters is much more comfortable and natural given the length of iPads versus the shorter iPhones. Sound produced from the speakers on higher end iPads will sound substantially better than from the speakers built into smaller iPhones. However, people who want high-quality sound will hear precisely the same thing on any kind of device if they use Bluetooth headsets, earbuds, or speakers.
    While you can use the same apps, the experience will differ more than might be anticipated. The operating system and gestures are essentially the same. However, iPads now run a completely separate operating system called iPadOS. This branching from iOS allows the development of a system which is specially designed to take advantage of the size of iPads and the different ways people can put this size to use.
    The app layouts and position of the keys is very different on iPads versus iPhones. I have spatial difficulties, and this has made using an iPad substantially harder for me. There's more space to have gestures go crooked and be misinterpreted. I'll try to do a three-finger swipe and have it misunderstood unless I manage to do it very straight. I've also found that double taps with two fingers may be interpreted as a tap with one finger if they're too close together. More things are on the same screen, since the surface area is so much larger. For sighted people, this means a lot fewer taps and swipes to get where they want to be. For blind people, it means figuring out where more things are crammed into the same space. With good spatial awareness and mental mapping skills, this will be a possibly large advantage, much as it is for people who can see. For me, it proved to be very frustrating. I've used an iPhone for about fifteen years and often don't have to consciously think about where things are due to muscle memory. On my iPad, everything seemed in a different place. It's like switching to a new Bluetooth keyboard. It's still a QWERTY layout, but the shift keys are different, or the spacebar is small. Old habits are hard to break, and things are so similar that the differences throw you all the more. Had I been using an iPad since day one, I might not feel quite the same frustration. I would presume that people who choose an iPad will eventually gain a similar competence to what I have on my iPhone. It's a matter of developing muscle memory and an understanding of how apps are typically laid out to take full advantage of the substantially larger screen. Past a certain point of competence, you won't have to put as much effort into learning how to use apps efficiently, since you'll have absorbed the basic conventions on where controls and interface elements tend to be.
    A good example of this sort of different layout is the Settings app. On the iPhone, things are neatly separated into different areas. You double tap to go into Bluetooth settings, for instance, and those Bluetooth-related settings will be all that remain on the screen. You'd then use the Back button to get out of that area and back to the main settings. On the iPad, it's set up like a tree, with all Settings branches visible on the left side of the screen and areas of focus opening up on the right side as you double tap a branch to select it. Flicking over the screen becomes a much less efficient means of navigation on an iPad's larger display. You need to think spatially a lot more to get anything done quickly. Flicking left and right is still useful, though, since you can touch near what you want and then flick over to it.
    The larger size of an iPad may prove to be a real boon for Braille users. They will be able to use something called Braille Screen Input far more comfortably than on any iPhone. This basically lets you position your fingers on the touchscreen like you would on a Braille writer and enter Braille characters rather than using the normal onscreen keyboard. Instead of learning where all the normal keys are, you can place your fingers comfortably on the edge of the screen and enter Braille characters. I find this especially good with the iPad in landscape mode. This gives you the maximum length to find a comfortable position for your hands and quickly enter Braille characters. No iPhone will give you as long a side to work with as an iPad. I'd never use Braille screen input on my iPhone because my hands are too large to get them comfortably positioned. I'm a slow Braille writer, even on a Perkin's Brailler. On shorter iPhones like my iPhone 7, I found it quite arduous and uncomfortable. On longer iPhones like my iPhone 15 or 16 Pro, the spacing of my fingers is somewhat closer to what I remember typing on a Perkins Braille writer. It's not fast for me, but it's at least comfortable. The longer edge of an iPad allows me to truly find a comfortable hand position for Braille input as suitable as possible to my particular hands and finger spacing. My wife Sara has smaller hands and finds Braille Screen Input very useful on her iPhone 13. I haven't written in Braille seriously since my days in secondary school. For me, it's slower than using the onscreen keyboard, and way slower than using my Bluetooth keyboard. However, I can appreciate what a big advantage this is for people who write in Braille all the time.
    When choosing your iOS device, here's something else to think carefully over. iPhones have GPS receivers built into them. If you go the iPad route, you will need to purchase an external GPS receiver to use navigation apps like BlindSquare or Nearby Explorer. These apps will use data to supplement GPS information with up-to-date maps and points of interest drawn from online sources. An iPad won't be able to do this without cellular data available. You'd have to preload any information while on Wi-Fi before you started to travel. Also, it's much easier to use an iPhone while on the move than trying to use an iPad while walking. On the other hand, maps have a larger display area on an iPad and may be easier to comprehend. Presuming they can be obtained or explored while in range of Wi-Fi connectivity, this may prove a workable solution for iPad users. GPS apps which store landmarks and map information offline could combine nicely with a Bluetooth GPS receiver to provide a robust if bulky and battery-draining approach to navigating with an iPad. An iPhone has everything built in, so there wouldn't be the extra device to carry and worry about its battery charge.
    The cameras on iPads are good, but it's harder to position them when doing OCR on a sheet. Apple didn't think that cameras on iPads would be used like those on iPhones. The iPad throws a shadow over the page, and the camera is in the top-left corner of the large rectangular slab of an iPad you're trying to wield. An iPhone is far easier to hold in one hand over or near an object or page. If identifying objects and reading print pages is important to you, I strongly recommend an iPhone over an iPad. It's certainly possible to use an iPad for this kind of thing. Apps like Seeing AI and KNFB Reader will absolutely work, but you have to put more thought into positioning the camera and light conditions to get good results.
    One aspect often considered a major advantage of iPads is the ability to have multiple apps open and working on the same screen. The size of iPads means that there is enough room to display more than one app at once in a useful manner. This can be used in countless ways. You might work on a document while having your notes open and available in a separate app. Perhaps, you want to write an email while still keeping an eye on a show you're watching. That's straightforward to accomplish for users with sight. Blind people can also make use of this kind of multitasking. However, they had better have more spatial skills than I do. I've never been successful at using this capability. It's far easier for me to switch between apps displayed one at a time.
Device Longevity
I like my digital home to last a long time. I get comfortable with my computer or iOS device and don't relish the prospect of changing to a new one just for the sake of having the latest and greatest. Provided you remember your Apple account and password, you need not worry about losing anything. Once you purchase an app, ebook, album, etc., it can be downloaded onto a new device with ease. The lifespan of these devices depends on how careful their owners are with them. Setting that aside, I have found that they typically last and perform quite satisfactorily around four to five years. Having no moving parts aside from a very few buttons, there's not much to really break given appropriate care. During that time, you will receive free iOS upgrades that will improve how your device functions. They can work longer than this, especially now that Apple has increased its focus on having iOS support older devices for a longer time than previously. However, they will eventually be unable to keep up with advances in iOS, which is the operating system that runs them. When this happens, you won't be able to update to current releases of iOS. Apple supports older devices going back at least a few generations, so if you're happy with what you have, you can keep using it and updating your version of iOS until Apple eventually stops supporting it.
    To give you a sense of possible longevity, Apple released the iPhone 4S in 2012. It began its life using iOS 5.02, and people were able to upgrade to the latest version of iOS until iOS 9.36, which was released in 2016. The iPhone 6S currently holds the record as the longest supported iPhone. Released in September 2015, it was capable of updating to make use of iOS 15 released in late 2021. That makes six years of iOS upgrades. Presuming at least one battery replacement and good care taken, people would still be able to use the latest iOS version and many of the improvements made. However, they would miss out on features relying heavily on artificial intelligence or features requiring actual new hardware built into the latest chips.
    When devices reach the end of their useful cycle, they will become more sluggish and have a harder time using the current iOS version. Long before this point, most users would be tempted to upgrade to newer devices due to rapid improvements in their capabilities. These include everything from longer battery life, faster processors, better displays, better cameras, audio improvements, and cellular data improvements among many other possibilities.
    My iPhone XR could certainly have served my needs adequately for at least four or five years from when I acquired it in 2019. However, like so many others, I've upgraded twice on my own initiative and a further generation thanks to generous donors. I now use an iPhone 16 pro as my main device and the iPhone 15 I'm still paying for as my backup and secondary device. Had I not done this, I would long since have absolutely needed to replace the battery. It isn't just a case of having to recharge more frequently. Battery degradation effects performance. It is possible that other components such as the storage drive will wear out. However, it is far more likely that my iPhone will suffer physical damage, and that this would occur before I wanted to upgrade anyhow due to capability advancements.
    Sometimes, features that are introduced take a long time to be widely adopted. One example of this is something called Apple Pay. This is a system taking advantage of a kind of transmitter in newer iPhones and other iOS devices that can transfer payment information to equipment in restaurants and other places supporting the system. You authorize payment with your fingerprint or face when you want to pay for something. No more digging out your credit card and using those little inaccessible payment machines. Very nice for blind people, provided the system is actually supported where you would like to do business. It took quite a while before Apple Pay was widely adopted in Canada. For over a year past its introduction, I only made use of it occasionally, partially due to how long it took to be widely supported by restaurants and shops. This is one example of why it is sometimes better to wait while new features mature before upgrading. Another good example is the new 5G wireless networks. The iPhone 13 came equipped with a modem allowing their use. However, these networks were only starting to become widely available enough to make a practical difference in 2023 when I got my iPhone 15. I suspect that integrating and fully exploring the capabilities such a major network upgrade will make possible may take a generation or two of iPhones as Apple learns to maximize its utility. Particularly if you're in a rural area away from any major cities, having an iPhone which can access these networks wouldn't be a major driver for upgrading until perhaps 2026 or so.
    Similarly, Apple Intelligence is taking more than a year to fully emerge as envisioned by Apple. Changes originally slated for 2025 will now be delayed at least until 2026 and be part of changes to appear in iOS 19 through updates during 2026. This is a major new element of smartphones. Apple is working hard to balance safety and privacy concerns with the need to catch up in this area to other brands of smartphone. Safety being an overriding concern for Apple, they are being cautious to test features before releasing them. Many people are suggesting, in early 2025, that it would be wise to wait for the iPhone 17 range to be released. These are likely to have even more RAM or random access memory, and have other advancements which will make large language models essential to Apple Intelligence work more rapidly and smoothly on your device.
    The LIDAR scanner which appeared in the most expensive iPhones of 2020 is an example of a potentially more compelling development. This is even more the case if it should ever appear in more lower-priced iPhones. Apps have already been developed which take advantage of this capability to inform blind people exploring unfamiliar spaces how far away they are from objects and what's in their environment. Combining this scanner with the camera and artificial intelligence built into iOS devices has some very impressive implications for blind users. As I write this in mid-2025, apps and features using Lidar have become more abundant. Apple incorporated a suite of them into iOS, so you don't even need to consider third-party apps to get use out of Lidar. However, things simply haven't proved to be compelling enough for me and others on limited incomes to spend the extra money to get a Pro model iPhone which has the Lidar scanner built in. The difference in price is simply too great unless your lifestyle makes having these capabilities particularly valuable. This might be the case if you travelled to new places frequently. It may not be long before Lidar positively impacts blind users more widely. Especially if the Lidar capability is brought to lower cost iPhones or incorporated into more affordable head-mounted spacial computing glasses.
    Such advancements plus growing concern about shortages and economics did indeed compel me to upgrade to a new iPhone 13 at least a year earlier than I otherwise might have. Additional storage, better responsiveness, better artificial intelligence, and being ready for 5G when it arrived seemed like good ideas as the pandemic ground on and shortages began to impact everyday costs. Two years later, in October of 2023, I was tempted enough to upgrade yet again to an iPhone 15. Plenty of significant changes and upgrades had been introduced. The most immediately notable being the switch from Lightning to USBC. This major change opens the possibilities for many more accessories to be connected directly by cable rather than Bluetooth. Also, a new feature called the dynamic island went from being only available on pro models to being a feature across the entire iPhone range. Another thing which compelled me to upgrade was that my iPhone XR was likely in its last year of being able to accept iOS updates. I rely on having my older iPhone as a backup and second computing platform. This lets me read Braille notes while teaching the course based on this book and demonstrate things to people when giving presentations to groups. Of course, a new iPhone means some new accessories which I'll discuss later in this section.
Accessories
In an effort to cut costs and save the planet, Apple has stated that they will no longer include charging bricks or wired earbuds with iOS devices. You will need to specifically order them if you don't already have them from prior devices. At the time of this writing, you should still find an appropriate charging cable included which is either Lightning or USBC depending on your chosen device. The small end of the cable fits into the Lightning or USBC port on the bottom of your device. It's a kind of small slot. When properly inserted, it will noticeably click into place. The other end of the cable can either be plugged into the USB port of a computer or charging hub or into the port on a small charging brick. The 25-watt brick is a suitable option since it allows for fast charging and contains technology to help make certain your iOS device doesn't overcharge. Many other third-party chargers also have this facility. Be certain you have an appropriate charging solution for your device. A 25W charger and cable should cost around $30 to $50 if ordered from Apple. Third-party options may cost more but could offer more capabilities.
    EarPods are Apple's improved version of earbuds that are sculpted to better fit in the ears of most people. They now come in Lightning and USB-C varieties. Be certain to order the ones which will work with your device. They have a microphone housed in the tiny control set that you'll find hanging below your right ear when wearing them. There are three buttons on the controls. The control set feels like a thin cylinder with a flattened section in the middle. The top and bottom buttons flank the flat central portion and will raise or lower the volume when pressed. The flat central button has several functions. Pressing it will pause or resume playback. Should you receive a call, you can use that button to answer or end it quickly. Clicking it twice rapidly will skip to the next music track or audio file you may be listening to. Holding it in will invoke Siri, a digital assistant available to owners of iOS devices. A set of wired USB-C or Lightning-powered EarPods will cost around $20.
    Modern iPhones are also capable of wireless charging on chargers compatible with the Qi standard. This method is slower than charging via cable. However, it frees the port on your device for wired EarPods or other accessories. Wireless charging pads and docks range widely in price and capability. Prices range from around $40 to well over $100 for a more advanced charging solution capable of handling multiple devices.
    Another new addition to modern iPhones is called MagSafe. The basic idea is that tiny magnets found in the back of iPhone 12 and above are strategically placed to guide magSafe compatible charging pucks and other accessories into the precisely optimal position for best effectiveness. When I put my iPhone down on a standard wireless charging pad, finding the ideal position can be a problem. I need to slide it around and make certain it's properly centred. What's more, it is likely to move out of position while I'm operating the phone making gestures on it. This can cause charging to stop.
    MagSafe eliminates this concern by guiding the puck into the best position and then keeping it securely there. The MagSafe charger might slide on a smooth surface, but it will never come free of its spot on the underside of your iPhone unless you free it with a gentle effort. Other accessories can take advantage of these magnets to be held securely in place and charge your phone or simply be held firmly on the back of it. This is helpful with MagSafe compatible wallets and stands for example.
    This small group of accessories will prove more than sufficient for getting started. Indeed, some people never feel the need to equip themselves further regarding accessories for their devices. It all depends on what you choose to do with your iOS device. On one hand, there are people like my father who intends only to use my old iPhone 13 to make calls, read websites, etc. For him, a charger and cable may be all the accessories he needs. At the other end of the spectrum, there are people like me who use their iPhone as a very portable computer for many different tasks. Making and receiving calls is almost an afterthought. I typically have a power bank, charging cable, Bluetooth keyboard, Braille display, and other accessories ready to enhance what my iPhone can do.
    Should any of the more standard basic accessories break or ware out, you can easily obtain replacements from the Apple Store. You can download the Apple Store app onto your device and order replacements or spares using that app. There are many alternative sources for these accessories such as Target, Amazon, and local retail stores. I would recommend that at the very least, you get a spare charging brick and Lightning or USB-C cable as well as a spare set of EarPods. Cables do fray or break if they become snagged on things.
Accessories Beyond the Basics;
Leaving Your Laptop Behind:
    As iOS devices and apps have improved, the notion of leaving the laptop behind and using your iOS device plus portable accessories grows more tempting. As I update this section for the third edition, I have long ago crossed over that line. For over four years now, my laptop is frankly never used and stays in a safe storage space. Meanwhile, my iPhone and a small, light bag of accessories comes along with me nearly everywhere I go.
    Generally speaking, I don't miss the laptop at all. However, part of the reason for this is that I'm very familiar with how to do things on iOS. If you're just learning the basics, keep the laptop handy until you've grown comfortable with iOS and any accessories you choose. To achieve the same speed as when using a laptop, you need to know VoiceOver gestures as well as what your options are in terms of the ideal apps for what you want to do. This isn't a transition made overnight. You will initially take longer to do things until you become more proficient with the iOS environment.
    There are an overwhelming number of accessories and plenty of choices in all categories. These include different cases, external batteries [often called power banks], speakers, headsets, earbuds, keyboards, etc. Accessibility for blind people is not typically a consideration when these are designed. However, there are devices that are more accessible than others by sheer accident. Especially when it comes to headsets and speakers, there are increasingly good chances that you'll end up with something that has voice guidance and talks to you. Also, more Bluetooth accessories can report their battery charge level to the battery widget you can have in the Today view on your iOS device. Below, we'll look at some accessory choices I've made and how I approached them. Your travel kit will likely differ from mine depending on your specific needs, budget, and priorities. Never presume that I've found the one and only option or, indeed, even the "best" option available. I have plenty of unused souvenirs that I once had high hopes for.
    Adding to the difficulty of selecting the best possible gear, it's hard to try before you buy when it comes to physical accessories. Sometimes, you can go to a store and find demo units available. However, most often, there won't be that option as stores prefer not to open items and then not be able to sell them. This is especially true for less expensive items. Perhaps, you'll be lucky enough to have a family member or friend who has taken the risk before you and has an accessory he or she is happy with. Frequently, there will be information making its way around the blind community about particularly accessible or affordable accessories that are workable by blind people. Following in the footsteps of others is certainly a relatively safer choice. However, don't make the mistake of thinking that all possible options have been explored. You might very well take a chance and come away with the next smash hit accessory hitherto unheard of in the blind community.
    Much of the time, you'll be ordering accessories online and relying completely on reviews and descriptions found there. This is especially true if you include devices that are being crowd funded on Kickstarter or Indiegogo. You can come across some very innovative ideas there. For instance, one idea that came up during the writing of the first edition of this guide was called a Power Cap. Funded on Kickstarter, it was a hat outfitted with solar panels and a small rechargeable battery. A good thought in theory. You're unlikely to leave such a cap behind while in the sun, and the battery would be all topped up and ready presuming you spent enough time outdoors. Just because a large company hasn't thought of exactly what you might want, that doesn't mean someone with the skills and resources isn't trying to fund production and get started. Crowdfunding has proved to be a very effective way of funding products aimed at niche markets and devices that are sometimes more accessible to blind users. You also have the opportunity to ask questions of the creators and backers, who can see any pictures or videos about the product you're backing. Just be aware that things don't always turn out as well as might be wished.
    My first try at an ideal Bluetooth keyboard was a case in point. I found the campaign to fund it on Kickstarter and backed the Hexgears X1. It was a well- constructed mechanical keyboard. It had a tactile on/off switch, reported its battery status to my iPhone, and was physically about as well-designed as I could want. The only problem was that every so often, such as when I typed the "i" in "its" earlier, the keystroke failed to register. This seemed to have something to do with how the Bluetooth connectivity worked between that particular keyboard and my iPhone. I never had this difficulty with most of the keyboards I've used ever since.
    I was equally unlucky with a pair of small round Bluetooth speakers I backed on Kickstarter. Those were quickly buried in a desk drawer due to the creators implementing a power-saving mode that puts the speakers to sleep whenever no sound is playing through them. This means that they must awaken each time VoiceOver starts speaking if no other sound is coming from them. You therefore miss the first part of words while the speakers wake up again. For pure listening, they're perfectly fine. When my niece wanted some Bluetooth speakers, I gave them to her. She was delighted.
    Thankfully, there are reviews and descriptions of pretty much everything on the web. Mine them for the info you need to make the most informed choices possible when selecting your gear. Written reviews, podcasts, and video reviews are all very useful tools. Even if you can't see the video, reviewers tend to describe important tactile aspects in passing. You might also hear any sounds made by accessories, such as how keys or buttons sound when pressed or voice prompts spoken by accessories. This gives you a much better chance to come away with an accessory which you are happy with as a blind consumer. Look beyond what the manufacturers say. Chances are good that someone has tried what you're interested in. Learn from their experience whenever possible.
Why not a Notetaker or Laptop:
Inevitably, people will ask why you'd go through all the bother of acquiring accessories to overcome shortcomings of your iOS device rather than just taking a laptop or notetaker. It all comes down to portability, ease of repair, and economics. If something goes wrong with your laptop, you're completely out of action digitally speaking. It's a single unit that, if it needs repair, you'll have to do without any of its capabilities in the meantime. If your keyboard is damaged, you could certainly attach a Bluetooth or USB keyboard. However, if you want the one built into the laptop to work properly, you'll have to spend some time without the whole thing while it's fixed. Meanwhile, your iOS device is already a powerful enough computer for most student or travel needs. The iPhone further gives you a fully accessible smartphone plus GPS capability in a single pocket-sized device. Information is stored in the Cloud, so the risk of information loss is very minimal should disaster strike your iOS device. The accessories are individually far less expensive to replace if necessary. If you send a broken Bluetooth keyboard away for repair, you aren't missing the rest of the capabilities of your iOS device while it's being worked on. Also, there are usually inexpensive accessories like the AmazonBasics Bluetooth keyboard, for instance, that you could purchase if desperate.
    Once you've found the gear you really love, it will likely last as long or longer than your iOS device. Accessories such as batteries, speakers, and keyboards typically last a long time so need not be replaced when you upgrade to a new iOS device. When it's time to upgrade a laptop or notetaker, you're generally replacing the entire device, paying a substantial amount of cash to do this. Having external accessories last potentially long enough to be used with several iOS devices maximizes economic efficiency, so you can pick your moments when it comes to upgrading various components of your overall system. Excellent for people on tight budgets. For example, I waited for improvements promised by Bluetooth version 5 to make their way into the next generation of speakers. Once that happened by mid-2021, I did my research and chose a Stormbox Pro speaker created by Tribit. The speaker turned out to be more weighty and larger than I had envisioned. However, it's solidly built, has great battery life and produces amazing sound for its price. Even better, it reports the battery level to my iPHONE, so I can tell how charged the speaker is. There are sounds for pairing and activation. All of the buttons are distinguishable by touch. For some reason, VoiceOver fluctuates in volume while this speaker is in use even though VoiceOver isn't heard on the speaker but remains speaking via the iPHONE's speaker or ear-pods. A minor annoyance if you're using the speaker to share music or podcasts with others in the same place.
    Based on a friend's helpful recommendation, I've finally upgraded my Bluetooth speaker. I have an Avantree BoomByte. This combines an FM radio with reasonably good sounding stereo speakers. The device fits easily into a bag or pack and has physical controls. Sound prompts indicate connectivity and also indicate when the unit is turned on or off. Tuning is done digitally with the physical buttons on the speaker. There's also a prominent volume and power knob.
    As of November 2023, I carry an even smaller Bluetooth speaker in my pack. It's the first one I've gotten which is produced by JBL and is their Go 3 model. It's easily held in my palm, uses Bluetooth 5, has audio indicator sounds for pairing and low battery, and produces excellent sound for its size. While it's too small to give a stereo effect, it is designed to emit sound in all directions and fills a space nicely.
    Generally speaking, the iOS ecosystem is far more economical than others. Apps are often far less expensive and take advantage of the work Apple has done adding accessibility features to the operating system. You can make use of many of the same apps everyone else does. They need not be specially produced for blind people. That lowers the cost of adding capabilities to your iOS device like you wouldn't believe. It also makes relating to sighted people who use the same iOS devices easier. Sharing information, communicating, and tapping into the same markets for digital goods like books, music, and apps as everyone else are huge advantages blind people simply haven't experienced before iOS devices became accessible.
Bluetooth Keyboards:
For me, finding a good and affordable Bluetooth keyboard has become an ongoing obsession. On a laptop, you will likely stick to the keyboard already built into it. This is especially the case while travelling. However, when you want a physical keyboard to use with an iOS device, you're starting from scratch and the options are positively endless. Typing fast enough to take class notes on an iPhone or iPad is pretty much impossible for most of us. People with excellent muscle memory might manage. Feeling around making certain you have the right character slows me down considerably. Don't even think about trying to use Siri to dictate your notes in a classroom setting. Touchscreen keyboards are good for writing short emails, notes, and contact info, but for serious rapid sustained writing, a tactile keyboard is a must.
    Finding the perfect keyboard for your specific preferences can be a quest worthy of an epic poem. The pitfalls are plentiful. I've now tried and at least briefly owned somewhere close to twenty different Bluetooth keyboards. I haven't even come close to running out of keyboards I could try. However, at long last, I seem to have arrived at a nice plateau in this area. I actively use three of them currently for different situations. At one time, I believe I had eleven keyboards in the apartment at the same time. I'm down to five or six in total now having found good homes for the rest. Different people have very different priorities for their keyboards. The imperfect one for me might just be ideal for somebody else's needs.
    Why does finding my ideal keyboard matter so much to me? There are several reasons. I happen to do a lot of writing. It's my best form of art and mode of expression. I might not get paid for it, but it's still worth finding one's favourite tools for the task. Some people have their favourite paints, brushes, pencils, etc. I have my cherished apps and keyboards. Also, there are different tools for different circumstances. I might want something small, functional, and quiet to take on a short excursion. Alternatively, I might want something spacious but quiet for those occasions on a longer trip away when you want to type comfortably without disturbing anybody. And then, there's the one you have for when you're at home at your desk, wanting the very best possible functionality and typing feel. Such choices say a lot about a person and are therefore also akin to the fashion statements which people who have sight might make by wearing various articles of clothing. There's a deep satisfaction when one comes across perfection or something close to it.
    One question I get asked all too often by stunned and horrified friends and family is: "You're getting another keyboard?" There are so many factors to consider and promises of typing perfection to be found just over the next financial hill. Perhaps, the key switches aren't quite perfect. Maybe, there are no multimedia keys allowing for easy switching of music tracks while working. Or else, there's no way to find out how charged the keyboard is without sighted assistance, since the battery status isn't reported to your iOS device. Sometimes, it can be hard to tell whether the keyboard is even on or off due to there not being a physical power switch. Blind people aren't typically in mind when these keyboards are designed. There are many ways in which keyboards I've gotten have proved less than ideal. However, there are usually ways to cope if one must. Barring abject imperfections like the sad case of the Hexgears X1 keyboard I briefly mentioned earlier, getting something truly unusable is thankfully rare. There comes a point where you simply need to take the plunge, try something new, and hope for the best. However, there are ways to go about this pursuit which can sharply reduce the chance of such unfortunate disappointment.
    Step 1: Think about what your ideal keyboard would be like. Have a firm grasp on what you're after. You won't likely get exactly what you want, but it gives you a starting point. My ideal keyboard would be rigid and long enough to use on my lap when necessary. It wouldn't be too compact and would stick as closely as possible to a QWERTY design. Good tactile key travel and multimedia function buttons were important characteristics. I didn't want situations where I accidentally invoked a function like muting sound that was controlled by a flat pad, which I couldn't quickly distinguish by touch.
    Step 2: Pick one or two characteristics and start looking for keyboards that have them. Alternatively, think of what kind of person might want a keyboard like your ideal one. For me, that was authors. It had to be comfortable to do serious lengthy writing on. That comfort clearly trumped smaller size. It also had to be rugged, so it would withstand bumping against things. Sadly, that's just part and parcel of a blind man's lot in life. All the more so when said blind man requires hearing aids. If I go through the trouble of getting used to a keyboard, it had better last a long time. This thought exercise gives you plenty of good ideas for words to include in online searches. Google is superb at dishing out meaningful results from a few well-chosen keywords or phrases separated by commas. For instance, "rugged, Bluetooth keyboard, writers".
    Step 3: Go through reviews that your initial criteria pointed you to and narrow down the prospects by what you read about them. If a particular item seems especially promising, take the time to search on YouTube and your search engine of choice for more reviews specifically about that particular item. Think long-term satisfaction here. It's worth paying a little extra if you intend to live with your decisions for as long as possible, like I do most of the time. I would even go so far as waiting until I had the money to obtain a really critical part of your kit like a good comfortable keyboard. Hopefully, you'll do better than I have at measuring twice and cutting once.
    After the failure of the Hexgears X1, the first keyboard I chose was a Microsoft Universal Mobile keyboard. I read reviews and descriptions of many different Bluetooth keyboards. However, the Microsoft one kept coming up as being the closest thing to what I wanted. Video reviews let me hear the sound of the keys in use and also described aspects like the power button on the side. It had a rigid magnetic cover that folded open like a book and could be removed to be used as a stand. It would also serve as a tray to put my iPhone on while typing with it on my lap. Reviewers praised its comfortable size of 85% of a full keyboard and good tactile feedback. Battery life was excellent, letting people go at least a week of average use without charging. Closing the cover turned the keyboard off automatically. It was still one of my more expensive investments, but I found it on sale and pounced.
    When the keyboard arrived, it turned out to be somewhat shorter than I had envisioned. My spatial difficulties made themselves known as the keyboard was too short for truly comfortable use on my lap. It was perfectly possible with my knees close together, but not as comfortable as I had hoped. The keys felt good, and it was nice and sturdy. It was somewhat cramped when compared to a full-sized keyboard, but I had expected that. The function buttons turned out to be an even more valuable addition while using AirPods. I was thrilled overall with this purchase, especially while travelling. For increased comfort and efficiency, I later acquired a Grifiti lap desk designed for tablets and small keyboards. This let me set my iPhone in portrait mode beside the keyboard with both items being very stable and comfortable in my lap. A very nice combination that fitted into a small shoulder bag along with other items. After years of use, an unfortunate drink spill ended my ability to fully trust the keyboard. I definitely got my money's worth from that one.
    For home use, I initially wanted something with higher-profile keys more akin to a computer keyboard, but not a mushy membrane kind. The answer was to look for affordable Bluetooth mechanical keyboards. One lesson I had learned from the Hexgears board was that I initially preferred linear mechanical switches. There are many choices of switches typically named by colour. For instance, red switches are linear and travel smoothly up and down. On the other hand, brown switches have a tactile bump at the point where your keystroke is actually registered. I must say that it was a strange experience, having never actually seen colour, to have meaningful consequences and differences attached to words that had been devoid of such real visceral meaning throughout my life. Skilled light-fingered typists using a keyboard with brown switches can lift their fingers once this bump is felt and not press the key all the way down. I'm a heavy-fingered typist, so my keystrokes always "bottom out", as the keyboard aficionados would say, with a definitive noisy clack. There is a widely used solution to cut down on this noise. Basically, it involves you taking the time to remove each keycap from the board and put an O-Ring around the stalk of each key before putting the keycap back on the switch. This does help with reducing the clack of "bottoming out". However, it also introduces some of that mushy feeling common to membrane keyboards back into the equation.
    My second attempt at a good keyboard for home and travel resulted in a compact and cheep keyboard from a company called Kemove. It was what is known as a 60% keyboard. It's a mechanical keyboard with red linear switches. Priced at around $50 Canadian, it was one of my more affordable and successful keyboard gambles that I bought on Amazon. As usual, there were pluses and minuses. One of the reasons that it was so affordable is that there were only 63 keys on it. There were no number pad or function keys. There was a key called FN that allowed for extra capabilities such as adjusting the lighting on the keyboard and switching between connected devices. I had hoped this would allow me to use the number keys as multimedia control keys while holding the FN key down, but this didn't pan out. The keyboard was solidly built and had a physical on/off switch. Even better, it reported the battery charge level to my iPhone. Unfortunately, it was somewhat noisy to type on, so I didn't use it while travelling as I had hoped to.
    Wanting a relatively quiet but less cramped solution, my keyboard quest continued. I acquired my next three keyboards from a company called Keychron. Initially, I was scared away from the K3 keyboard due to reviews talking about poor build quality, allowing for too much flexibility unless on a solid surface. Thankfully, the K3 version 2 addressed those issues nicely. Using aircraft grade aluminium and a steel plate reinforcing the plastic bottom of the keyboard resulted in a sturdy keyboard with no flex at all. Being a 75% keyboard, it includes twelve function keys which are used as multimedia controls among other things while connected to iOS devices. This means I need only press a single key to pause, skip, etc. The F8 key, used on iOS to pause music or pick up a phone call, is right between the USB-C port found on the back of the keyboard and a small noticeable pinhole or marking. This helps find the important keys quickly. The length and sturdiness plus the low profile design made it possible for me to use this keyboard on my lap in comfort without a solid surface beneath it. There are feet at the back of the board which can go flat or fold out to make it possible to adjust the angle. It isn't at all dust or waterproof thanks to the floating keycap design. I chose red switches and have also ordered an alternative set of recently invented mint switches which incorporate a tactile bump as the key is pressed. Removing the old switches and installing the mint ones proved to be perfectly possible if a tad stressful. I ended up only replacing the character input switches. The letter, number, and punctuation keys all now have the mint switches. These feature a quiet tactile bump felt at the top of the keystroke, which I find very helpful on the low profile keys. The red linear switches are used for any command or function keys such as arrows, shift keys, etc.
    While it won't report the battery charge to my iPhone, it does have a 1550 milliamp hour (MAH) battery, as well as a physical on/off switch. I can live with this compromise. The battery charge should last roughly 90 hours, provided the backlighting is turned off. To tell whether backlighting is on or off, I can use a light detecting app like Seeing AI. Meanwhile, I could use an app like Be My Eyes if I need to know the level of charge. There is no noticeable lag with the Bluetooth version 5.1 connection. I have a keyboard pouch which I put it in while travelling. It comes with a custom designed dust cover which fits over the keys perfectly. The typing feel is excellent and exceeded my best hopes for low profile switches. That floating keycap design was what worked against my continued use of that board. The gap between the keycaps and keyboard base meant that they could catch on-things. This resulted in at least two broken switches and nearly losing several keycaps, which dropped quietly onto soft carpet and came off the keyboard silently.
    While at my desk, I wanted a full-sized keyboard. My first try was a Logitech MX Keys keyboard. It's a notably heavy keyboard with a long base which juts down from the back of the keyboard. This base contains the battery and electronics. The keyboard is weighted and angled so that it is very stable on a table or desk. This sadly makes it a horrible choice for use on a lap or as a travelling keyboard. On the plus side, the typing, and Bluetooth are both exceptional. Pairing to devices is done via dedicated buttons at the top of the board. Connectivity doesn't get any easier. The battery charge is reported to iOS, so I can tell when to plug the keyboard in. All in all, a great keyboard for home use, which I thought I'd be happy with for years.
    It's a good idea to have a backup keyboard around. Should something happen, you'll keenly feel the lack of a keyboard while using the touchscreen for typing. There's simply no comparison. Physical keyboards are simply always going to offer better speed provided you're a skilled typist to begin with.
    Sadly, accidents do happen to keyboards. I spilled water on my Microsoft keyboard while it was open, and I was certain it had been ruined. So certain, in fact, that I bought a cheaper Bluetooth keyboard, which sadly exhibited too much lag to be used very well. Thankfully, the Microsoft keyboard stopped turning my typing into gibberish after around a week of being left lying open to hopefully dry up the water. It seems to be in full working order, but I can't quite trust it as I once could.
    By the time I was finishing the second edition, I had pounced on what seemed like a much better keyboard yet again. A company called Nuphy makes superb mechanical keyboards. I'm especially fond of their low profile Air75, which is the perfect size for travel and sturdy on my lap. The second version of this marvel had enough tempting upgrades to wear down my resistance. I have now acquired it, and I am typing on it at this very moment. I settled on the Moss tactile switches offered by Nuphy which require more force to push down than standard brown switches. This has proven to be a stable favourite keyboard for desktop use and works very well on my lap. Unlike the Keychron K3, the keycaps on the Air75 V2 aren't floating above the frame with edges of keys liable to snag on packs and come off. The frame protects them even when the keys are totally raised. Also, wonder of wonders, the keyboard reports the battery charge status to the iPhone's battery widget. I have found something very close to perfection with this particular Nuphy keyboard. Eventually, I will doubtless upgrade to their latest version of the Air75 design. How many generations I'll wait before upgrading is an open question.
    While close to perfection, there are a few drawbacks. The Air75 V2 is by far the most exquisitely wonderful typing experience I've discovered. Typing on it feels like you're building something with your hands as well as your mind. There's a feeling of absolute sturdiness, heft, and solidity to this keyboard. It also has all of the multimedia functions I need. However, it's somewhat loud to type on. There are times when this well and truly sucks. If Nuphy ever comes up with silent tactile switches which prevent the keys from bottoming out, I would cheerfully buy those and do the work of installing them.
    Another drawback is that it's somewhat heavy. There are many situations when something quieter, lighter, thinner and smaller are preferable. To be ready for such occasions, I've acquired two more keyboards! Yikes! They're everywhere!
    Based on my positive experience with the Logitech MX Keys full-sized keyboard, I got the Mini version. This keyboard is weighty and lacks some of the multimedia functionality of my Nuphy keyboard. However, it's extremely quiet to type on while still being very comfortable and spacious. It fits nicely on the lapdesk I mentioned earlier, taking up its entire length but leaving room at the top. Enough for my iPhone to fit sideways behind the keyboard if space is at a premium.
    There are times when you'll be out for a short amount of time or want to really minimize what you're carrying with you. My second very welcome acquisition was a folding keyboard from Protoarc. Built for travellers, the XK04 is a keyboard which is very light and folds in half to the size of a small pocket notebook. It has a PU faux leather cover which moves as you open the keyboard so that it sits level on a flat surface. There's a physical on/off switch on the right edge below the USB-C port. Thankfully, there's no backlighting to worry about. Two hours of charge gives you around a hundred and fifty days of standby time and over a hundred hours of use. It's a 65% keyboard so there's no number pad, six-pack, or function row. However, holding down the fn key found to the right of the left control key gives you all of the six-pack and multimedia functions. For instance, holding the fn key and hitting the number eight will perform a magic tap. This picks up or hangs up phone calls, starts and stops music, etc. Holding down the FN key and the letters q, w, or e will let you switch between devices you have paired with the keyboard. Holding the same key combinations and keeping them down for over two seconds puts the keyboard in pairing mode, so you can connect a device to that particular combination. The typing is a bit cramped but the keys are all in their proper places, and it's a very quiet keyboard. A much better experience than the iClever folding keyboard I tried earlier. As of March 2025, the Protoarc XK04 was available for under $50 Canadian on amazon.
    Between these three keyboards, I feel like I have the best possible keyboard for any writing environment or situation I'm likely to encounter. From the desk or balcony table I work long hours at to a crowded table at a restaurant where I might want to type out an idea while waiting to order, I can come ready to write. For now, at least, my quest for the perfect keyboard has concluded. My quibbles with these keyboards are minor enough that I can't justify spending money barring some major new development or keyboard destroying disaster.
    I wish everyone the best of good fortune in your quest for a good keyboard. There's endless choice. Even mechanical Bluetooth keyboards are becoming quite affordable. There are some keyboards that connect via the USB-C or Lightning port on your device and don't require batteries. I have yet to try one of these. They would offer some compelling advantages. No need to charge a separate battery or carry the weight of one. There would also be absolutely no lag whatsoever or any chance of a dropped Bluetooth connection. A possible disadvantage is that such a keyboard would drain a minimal amount of power from your iPhone's battery and take up your Lightning or USB-C port. iPad owners can find cases that have keyboards built into them. This pretty much turns an iPad into a basic laptop. For people who struggle with touchscreen typing, having a physical keyboard can make a world of difference. There are keyboard commands in iOS and VoiceOver to accomplish pretty much everything, and you can create your own shortcut commands if what you need doesn't exist already.
Beware the Lag:
When it comes to keyboards, speakers, earbuds, and headsets, blind people have a major concern that supersedes nearly all others. That is to minimize or completely avoid Bluetooth lag. Lag results from the time it takes data to be sent via Bluetooth between devices. Bluetooth uses radio waves to transmit data. Techniques are used to eliminate interference from other devices and check for any errors introduced in transmission and maintain connectivity between devices. A lot is happening behind the scenes to provide basic connectivity. Blind people require VoiceOver's responses to their actions to be as close to instant as possible. Even a split-second delay can be very frustrating and lessen your ability to competently control your device. If you're sighted, imagine having to wait a half second before the character you typed appeared on-screen.
    Lag matters more in some contexts than others. Sound delay doesn't matter as much for listening to music, podcasts, or audiobooks. You're not interacting much with your device while this happens, and the sound can simply play. However, lag becomes bothersome and even a serious concern when you rely exclusively on sound to actually control your device. Enough lag might result in you thinking that you're on one control while you're actually on another. Instead of pausing your book, you might skip back a whole chapter. You could accidentally hang up an important conference call rather than muting your microphone while attending to something private. It's vital that VoiceOver reports the current status or the result of a gesture as soon after it is made as possible.
    To avoid lag, look for a high Bluetooth version number. Don't get anything using Bluetooth 4. Bluetooth 4.1 is as low as you should be willing to go. Higher is better. Bluetooth 5 is now the market standard. Products that use improved versions up to 5.3 are not uncommon. This will give better speed, more reliable connectivity and range. Bluetooth 5 hasn't quite eliminated all lag, but it has become far less of a deal-breaker issue than when I wrote the first edition of this guide. That has certainly been my experience with the growing collection of Bluetooth 5 and 5.1 accessories I've begun to accumulate. Apple uses its W1 and newer W chips to further enhance Bluetooth connectivity, solving many problems with connectivity between its devices and accessories.
Audio Accessories:
Sound is a blind person's primary sense. Good audio is thus of massive importance to us. My third generation AirPods have almost no lag, are dirt simple to pair, and have good battery life. They don't seal the ear canal, so it's possible to use them while wearing hearing aids if you're careful. For me, the lack of volume and other control on the AirPods was a small price to pay for completely wireless operation and extreme portability. I don't mind using my iPhone to perform these functions. Also, when I'm using any of my current Bluetooth keyboards, there are keys letting you control these things without needing to touch your iPHONE. AirPods work wonderfully for me along with my hearing aids and combine unexpectedly good sound with extreme portability. However, I wouldn't use AirPods while walking outdoors. They are tiny, and it would be too easy to lose them if they ever fell out of your ears. Also, earbuds block too much of your ability to hear your surroundings.
    The latest AirPods Pro attempt to address this concern while sealing your ear canal entirely. I acquired a pair of second generation AirPods Pro in late 2023. They offer excellent noise cancellation. With my hearing loss, that's the last thing I actually need in all but horrendously noisy situations. However, they also have transparency mode among other audio tricks to help people keep aware of sounds in their environment. In the accessibility settings, there's an area called headphone accommodations. A great deal of fine-tuning is available here. A key feature is called transparency mode. I'm able to amplify this and partially compensate for my hearing loss while in safe, relatively small places. This came in very handy when my hearing aid broke and took weeks to repair. They acquired a new hearing aid mode in 2025 which lets them function as over-the-counter hearing aids.
    Concern is growing even for sighted people about this constant quest for sound isolation. For blind people, it's vital to hear what's happening around us.
    These concerns led me to seek a good outdoor alternative. Shokz offers wired and Bluetooth bone conduction headsets. Basically, transducers positioned in front of your ears send sound through your bones, leaving ears free to hear what's around you. These have tactile controls, voice guidance, and don't block your ears, leaving them free to hear your surroundings. They are also very unlikely to fall off. You lose some sound quality compared to other headsets or AirPods, but it's worth the trade when outdoors or while your ears are wet after swimming or taking a shower.
    The shopping procedure is the same for audio accessories as with the keyboard. Think about what you want, and then seek options that give you as much of what you're after as possible. Think long-term. Many accessories can get updated firmware. This allows manufacturers to make improvements after products are in the field. AirPods can receive such updates so that Apple can improve them, taking customer feedback into consideration. I expected my AirPods to last years and made my choice with long-term satisfaction in mind. After a little over three years, my original AirPods were showing their age with decreased battery life and connection dropouts. Overall though, they were a superb investment, and I had no hesitation about more recently purchased AirPods discussed earlier.
    Be mindful of the power required by these accessories. Apple AirPods last around five hours, but have a charging case that contains enough for multiple charges. I likely won't have to use an external battery to recharge them between opportunities to plug in most of the time. You can use and charge them separately, charging one while using the other. That won't be an option with headsets. While they're charging up, you're out of action unless you have a backup plan like using Lightning or USB-C EarPods. Sadly, these are no longer included with each iPhone, and you'll have to purchase them.
    I got curious one morning and decided to chase down the actual MAH capacity of my original AirPods. Thanks to a site called www.ifixit.com. I found my answers. These people take products apart to see how easy they are for people to repair. In that process, they find out some nifty stuff. In their teardown of Apple AirPods, they determined that the tiny batteries in each AirPod hold a charge of 93 MAH. The case holds a charge of 398 MAH. Theoretically, you could fully charge both AirPods at least twice. Presuming you fully charge everything before starting your day, that gives you the initial five hours plus enough charge for ten hours of both AirPods plus some extra charge.
    While navigating outdoors or waiting for my ears to dry before popping in the hearing aids, I'm currently using an Aeropex headset from Shokz. It's a nice upgrade from the older Trekz Titanium headset. The helpful voice guidance has been retained. Bluetooth 5 offers solid relatively lag-free connectivity. The transducers or smaller and the headset is far lighter than its predecessor. The sound quality is also much improved, but still not what you'd get from more ordinary earbuds or headphones. The mic built into the headset is also much better for phone calls than prior headsets.
    Sometimes, you can find devices with impressive extra features. For instance, there are Bluetooth speakers with built-in FM radio capability. The USB charging cable that comes with these devices often serves as an antenna allowing for good FM reception, in addition to providing a method for recharging the batteries. Read reviews carefully to help determine how easy to operate and how tactile the controls on devices are. If devices use touchscreen controls or buttons that are hard to feel, you may not be able to use them. Also, there are companies who are more aware of accessibility issues. Shokz are a good example, as they equip their headsets with voice prompts and have tactile controls.
    The Fugoo line of Bluetooth speakers come equipped with built-in voice guidance. A radio announcer voice can inform you of the battery level, connection status, and which mode the speaker is operating in. For instance, there is a loud volume mode for outdoor use and a power saving mode. The controls are all tactile buttons located on the top and at the ends under the top edges of the speaker jacket. The sound is quite good, and there is very little lag. Other speakers may also feature built-in digital assistants such as Alexa that are voice operated. Still, other accessories might produce sounds to inform people who aren't looking or, in our case, can't look, about their status or when options are chosen. The Stormbox Pro speaker I recently obtained offers sound cues for when devices are paired, power is turned on or off, etc.
Extra Power:
Blind people can put heavy demands on the batteries in iOS devices. Increasingly, I've been hearing that using the VoiceOver screen curtain works the same as setting the Screen Brightness to 0% when it comes to conserving power. People with low vision will save power by finding the lowest brightness setting which works for them. While we save power needed for screen brightness, GPS, Bluetooth, cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity, and constantly producing audio drains power. You can turn off things like Wi-Fi if you're not using it. Airplane mode shuts down all transmission of any kind from your iOS device and is helpful when you want to recharge your device rapidly. However, if you turn off Bluetooth, AirPods, and other Bluetooth audio accessories won't work. You'll likely need Bluetooth on all the time. The more connectivity you turn off, the less potentially useful your iOS device is. You can't receive a phone call or text message while in Airplane mode unless you specifically turn on the needed capabilities. The same goes for handy apps like Seeing AI that need Internet connectivity. These devices are so helpful that we want them to be ready whenever we need them. Extra portable power doesn't cost a fortune and just makes sense.
    Apple sells cases that contain additional battery power for their products. For people likely to forget extra gear like external batteries, this can be a very good idea. They offer an additional advantage of communicating their level of charge to your iOS device, so you can know how much you have remaining. I have yet to find an external battery which does this. However, cases built for your current iOS device might not be useable on future ones. Changes in size and the position of ports can easily render a case useless once you trade in your old iPhone for a nice new one. Presuming you'll be using an iOS device for two or more years, battery cases designed specifically for your device can absolutely prove a worthwhile investment.
    Going with external batteries, you will almost certainly be able to use them on future iOS devices for as long as the batteries can keep recharging. All rechargeable batteries will eventually wear out. However, they are relatively inexpensive to replace when that's necessary. The only possible thing you'll sacrifice when using an older battery is charging speed. Newer iPhones and batteries will be able to charge faster than older batteries will allow. I have yet to hear of a talking external battery or one that communicates its charge level to your iOS device. Short of asking a sighted person with you or using an app like Be My Eyes, there's no way to know how much charge your external battery has. Therefore, you need to get into the habit of charging them up regularly. Get more power than you need so that if you forget to charge the battery or are away from power sources for longer than expected, you'll be ready to cope.
    One way to help counter the threat of forgetting to keep your power bank charged as well as your iPhone is to buy a power bank which has a foldable plug built right into it. The Anker GAN Prime 733 combines a 67 Watt charger with two USB-C and one USB Ports as well as a 10000 MAH power bank in one handy device. You can leave it plugged in and use it to charge your devices. Then, when you're heading out and about, simply remove the device from the outlet and fold in the plugs. You now have a fully charged power bank which easily fits in a pocket or bag ready to go. The power bank is designed to charge your devices first and then recharge itself. Provided things are left plugged in overnight or as a general rule, the power bank will be fully charged when you need it to be. The battery management software built into your iOS devices will make certain they never become overcharged. Having them plugged in whenever possible is a far safer practice than it once was.
    There is currently one accessible power bank that I'm a happy owner of. It's made by a company called Energrid and is designed specifically for blind people. With a USB A and a USB-C port capable of rapid charging, it has a capacity of 20000 MAH. It could charge an iPhone four times with power to spare. They also have a smaller 10000 MAH version of their accessible battery. This is potentially more suited to smaller bags than pockets. These power banks are available at:
    www.atguys.com
    The energrid company will also ship to Canada and can be ordered from directly at:
    https://accessibility.energrid.us.com
    The two current versions are the VS810PD and VS820PD. The battery costs around $100 Canadian. Compared to other regular power banks, this is expensive. You can obtain power banks with a lot more capacity for far less than this price. These power banks will almost certainly be lighter, have more ports to charge devices, and may be smaller in physical size. The dimensions of the older Energrid battery I had are 14 centimetres long, 6.5 centimetres wide, and 2 centimetres thick. This is about 51/2 inches long, 23/4 inches wide, and just a tad under an inch thick; 13/16 of an inch to be exact. The newer 20000 MAH battery is a comparable size to this. It will fit into a pocket in a pinch or effortlessly into a purse or pack. However, people may find it a little heavy in the pocket. As far as I'm aware, this company is producing the only truly accessible power banks in North America currently available.
    Clearly, safety has come first in the design of these power banks. The battery doesn't get very hot when charging or while giving power to devices, even when charging two things at once. You could comfortably charge things with the battery in your pocket.
    Though relatively expensive for a power bank of similar capacity, you avoid the problems encountered with normal power banks. For one thing, since they were designed for blind people, there's no flashlight to get inadvertently activated, draining power for weeks as it shines uselessly. When you plug the battery in to charge, a single beep and vibration happens. This also happens when you plug something in to be charged. You'll know for certain when you're charging things and when the battery is charging. You'll also be alerted when the battery is fully charged. It will emit a long continuous beep and vibration to let you know. This also happens if you plug in the charging cord and the battery is already fully charged. This will help to prevent overcharging the power bank.
    To find out how much charge is in the battery, press the button on the battery. It will give four short vibrations and beeps if it has from 100% to 75% power. Three vibrations and beeps indicate the battery has between 75% down to 50% power. Two vibrations/beeps indicate 50-25%, and one beep is 25% or less. Hold the button in, and it switches from sounds and vibrations to just vibrations. This is useful when you don't want to disturb others but need an idea how much power you have.
    All of these features will help you take better care of the power bank itself, as well as avoid any nasty surprises. Recently, I took an ordinary power bank to an event only to find that it had no charge in it at all despite my thinking that I had left it properly plugged in the day before. With the Energrid accessible battery, I've never once been caught unawares with a dead battery. Also, I can always be certain that I've successfully plugged accessories in. While your iOS device will let you know via a sound when it is charging, other accessories don't tend to do this.
    Another thing to remember is that most of these batteries can serve as relatively powerful flashlights. This usually involves pressing a button located on the battery. A handy feature for sighted people, but a liability for blind people who can't tell when they've accidentally activated the flashlight. One way for blind people to deal with this independently is to have a light detector app and use your iOS device's camera, moving it near where the flashlight in the battery is. This is typically on the top near the power ports. The Seeing AI app from Microsoft is free and includes this capability. Select the Light Detector channel. A higher-pitched tone indicates an increased level of light.
    Batteries have a capacity measured in MAH. An iPhone 7 has an internal battery that holds roughly 2,000 MAH when fully charged. An iPhone 10 holds 2,900 MAH. An iPhone 13 holds 3227 MAH. An iPad Air 2 holds around 8,000 MAH. An iPad Pro has a 10,300 MAH battery. The general premise is that these batteries should last a day of typical use. In practice, this pretty much never happens. Talk of people running out of charge during their day is constant. Accessories are also prone to this need for additional power. My Shokz Trekz Titanium headset has around 830 MAH and lasts around six hours of continuous use. Were I to use that for a full day, I'd have to recharge the headset at least once. The iPhone would need at least a full charge and possibly more, presuming heavy constant use. If you're using it as a laptop replacement, reading audiobooks, navigating with GPS, and actually (gasp) talking on the phone, that qualifies as heavy use. You would easily burn through around 2,500 to 3,000 MAH or thereabouts over a long busy day.
    The tradeoff is normally power available versus weight and size of a given external battery. You can get batteries holding around 27,000 MAH that weigh perhaps as much as a couple of pounds and easily fit in a purse or bag. However, they're too large to fit easily into a pocket. At the other end of the spectrum, you can get batteries the size of credit cards that offer around 2,000 MAH of charge. Most of the time, you'll have opportunities to charge daily. Given that, I recommend a 10,000 MAH capacity battery. These should easily fit in a pocket along with your iPhone and AirPods. Anker makes good reliable light and portable batteries. You'll find numerous competing companies in this space, so look around for what suits you. There are many perks and advantages, such as faster charging, more charging ports, MagSafe and wireless charging capability, etc. They also produce other charging equipment like durable Apple-certified Lightning cables. Most external batteries don't automatically come with a lightning cable included, so keep that in mind if you have an older iPhone. Use the one that came with your device, plugging the USB end into the battery and the Lightning end into your device. Spare cables are quite inexpensive. I recommend you obtain one to be kept with your external battery at all times.
    Going farther off the grid, there are accessories that allow you to charge your batteries via solar energy or via pedal or crank power. These accessories often combine several features suitable for emergencies. Eton is a company who makes well-known, respected emergency gear like radios which offer USB crank charging capability.
Cases:
It's generally a good idea to get a case to protect your iOS device. You will eventually drop it, knock it off a desk, or worse. Considering how much you'll come to rely on your device, investing in a case is a no-brainer. Picking the right one requires some care. Shape matters. The battery case for iPhones has a hump on the bottom where the battery is. The extra power is certainly handy; however, the hump protruding from the bottom might slightly destabilize the phone when it's on a flat surface. Some cases are thicker than others. There are cases designed to be extra rugged for adventure travel. Others offer built-in, collapsible Bluetooth keyboards. Many offer extra battery capacity. Some offer extra data storage operating like flash drives for computers.
    Keep in mind that unlike other accessories, cases are likely not going to be useable when you eventually upgrade to a new iOS device. The thickness, port positions, and size and shape of iPhones and iPads have changed enough to render many cases totally useless on more current iOS devices. That makes me stick with rugged simplicity. I use cases for protection only, and find other external accessories that I can continue to use after upgrading.
    I have now had direct experience with a number of cases from some brands. Originally, I chose an Otterbox Defender case. It was thin and flat, offering reasonable inexpensive protection for my earlier iPhones. For a good while, I enjoyed the safety provided by the more expensive Life proof cases. These are cases which are waterproof, drop-proof, dust-proof, and shock-proof. They are pricier than Otterbox cases, but offer even better protection. However, they had a reputation for muffling the sound coming from the speakers of your device. My hearing loss has made this a more noticeable thing in more recent times. Some cases have slots for Lightning cables that are less forgiving of bulky cable ends. That might prevent you from using some Lightning-connected accessories or docks without first removing your iOS device from its case. Most good cases these days have built-in screen protectors. If the case you're looking at doesn't have that, and you think the responsiveness tradeoff incurred by using one is worth the protection, don't even consider getting a case and separate screen protector. Sticking on screen protectors is annoying and utterly unnecessary given the affordable protective cases which have built-in screen protection available.
    For my iPhone 13, I decided on two cases. One was a clear MagSafe case from Apple. I wanted to see how convenient I found the MagSafe charging system to be. While it was very nice, the case had no built-in screen protection and offered very little protection from drops and impacts. I was somewhat disappointed overall. Wanting better protection, I went with a Supcase Unicorn Beetle. It was widely praised in reviews and had a version ready right away when the iPhone 13 came out. I was quite pleased with this purchase. The case was thick enough to offer excellent protection and had an outer layer which is easy to grip well. The built-in screen protection was good and the buttons were well covered but still easy to use and identify. It had a kickstand on the back which let you prop up your iPhone. Unfortunately, due to this stand and the thickness, it wasn't possible to use MagSafe charging without first removing the phone from the case. Ordinary wireless charging worked quite well, so I used that or simply plugged in a USB-C to Lightning cable for much faster charging. Sound wasn't blocked at all.
    For my iPhone 15, I went on YouTube to look into what the latest best cases were. Two contenders had established themselves while I hadn't been paying much attention to cases. Those were Mous and Casetify. These are premium cases. I paid nearly $100 for the Mous Limitless 5.0 carbon fibre backed case I ultimately chose. Rather than a screen protector, this case has a raised lip extending upward from the edges of the screen, which is more pronounced at the top and bottom edges. This absorbs impacts from drops onto the screen, preventing it from contacting the ground. The case apparently looks quite good but protectiveness was what sold me. Despite how thin it is, the material inside will protect it from a fall of at least eight feet. That's well over two metres, which is the highest fall I think at all likely. These days, iPhones are reasonably well protected against water and I don't worry about spills or brief dips. The case offers excellent grip, further reducing the chance of a drop in the first place. Also, I can take full advantage of MagSafe.
    My experience with the Mous case was so good that I bought a Limitless 6.0 case even before I received my iPhone 16 Pro. It offers splendid protection and a nice grippy texture on the sides. Since I acquired mine, they updated the design to cover the camera control on the right side. While I might have preferred this, I'm pleased with the original design with a cutout indentation in the side of the case.
    Another thing to keep in mind about cases is how personal a choice they are. Don't buy them thinking that you'll find a good home for them when you no longer need them. Cases change the look of one's iPhone. My oldest niece who wanted my iPhone 7, had no interest in the cases I obtained for it in my quest for personal case perfection. They still abide in my desk drawer to this very day.
Conclusion:
There are plenty of choices in your approach to accessorizing your iOS device. Finding the best ones for you can be a thrilling pursuit, similar to finding the perfect outfit or decorating your personal space. Moments of success can be truly wonderful. Particularly, when you couldn't quite be certain what to expect from a choice. I experienced that joy when I tried typing on my Keychron K3 keyboard after I finished installing Mint switches beneath the character keys. Having two different types of switch on the same keyboard in the configuration I thought of was a rare moment of tactile artistry. It's something I deeply enjoyed typing on and sharing that experience with others who wonder why I did it.
    These days, I have accessories to suit any trip or brief outing I might make. I've had sufficient time, resources, and experience to acquire a very good set of tools and suitable bags and packs to carry them in. My smallest minimal setup includes a roughly four-pound set of accessories. These are a folding keyboard, power bank, flat water bottle and cables I can fit into an Alpaka Tech Case Max and throw over my shoulder. I don't have to take it off while in transit. For longer trips or ones where I might need more tech, I have a padded sling, an Alpaka Bravo Sling Max V2 to be precise. It has room for my 14-cell Braille display, Logitech MX Keys keyboard and lapdesk, larger water bottle, extra power bank, and more. This bag keeps everything organized and in easy reach while I work on my balcony in the Summer. It also has room for my folded cane and iPhone when other places for those are covered by a Winter coat. While at home, I have a phone sling attached to my belt which keeps it very handy. Yes, these are also from Alpaka. There are many other brands. For more budget friendly, check out Tomtoc. Aer and Matador also make good packs and slings for carrying tech around.
    I hope this section helps you have an even more enjoyable experience than I've had in hunting down and assembling a collection of accessories which truly maximize what your iOS device can do for you. It can be an overwhelming space to look around in. Some people will inevitably find shopping for the best accessories for their needs to be fraught with stress and uncertainty. Especially in tighter financial circumstances. If you find that this is the camp to which you belong, my best advice is to stick to the basics. At a minimum, you should obtain a case, spare charging cable and power brick from Apple, so you're never without the ability to charge your device. I would also strongly suggest a power bank even if you only have it for emergencies. A spare set of EarPods is also a good idea. These are very inexpensive items and are widely available. There are very affordable Bluetooth keyboards which won't break the bank taking a gamble on. Many mechanical Bluetooth keyboards are sold for around $50 to $70 which might serve you admirably.
    Another more costly way of reducing stress is to only purchase accessories directly from Apple. They offer versions of everything you'd need, and it's pretty much guaranteed to work with your device. The Apple Store app is easy to use and fully accessible. Apple provides all the details you'll need, including whether something is compatible with the particular iPhone or iPad you might have. They steer you towards their products or those produced by companies they've formed close ties with. You'll find power banks, keyboards, and all manner of items. Typically, you'll pay what is generally known as the "Apple brand premium", where there are much cheaper and perfectly serviceable alternatives if you do your research and shop elsewhere. However, Apple does run a safe and convenient operation.
    You can put together a travel bag that is slung over a shoulder and weighs far less than ten pounds. This weight could even include an external battery that could keep your system fully charged for days of activity. I typically aim for more mid-range products in terms of cost. However, there are companies which offer good quality products while keeping them affordable. Tomtoc is a more budget friendly pack maker worth investigation. This kind of easy portability and reliability is incredibly liberating. Particularly, since most of the actual core capability can fit in a pocket, presuming you use an iPhone as your computing power. iPads are larger but are very light and thin devices. Their larger screen size can be tremendously helpful to people with useable vision.
    Going beyond these basics, have a clear idea of what capabilities you want. If you intend to do a lot of adventure travel, you may want to look into ways of keeping your devices powered while off the grid. There are external batteries capable of hand-crank or solar recharging. If you attend parties, you may want a Bluetooth speaker capable of allowing multiple users to easily pair and play songs. Such speakers absolutely exist. Most Braille displays can pair with your iOS device over Bluetooth and work with VoiceOver. Should you live with other disabilities, there are all sorts of switch controls and other accessories that may be helpful. There are even game controllers for hardcore players. New and better accessories constantly appear.
    Manufacturers of accessories are quick to advertise if they work with iOS devices. Now that all modern iPhones have switched to USBC ports rather than Lightning, this world of choice has grown substantially bigger. As long as you take the time to read descriptions carefully, you won't end up with something that is completely incompatible. For blind people, it's essential to pay attention to details of interface. How easy is it to operate a given accessory strictly by touch and hearing? That's where it can really pay off to check out reviews from people who have used the devices you're considering. A good place to start is www.applevis.com. They have a growing number of accessory reviews in addition to their extensive information about apps. Often, there are even podcasts available where people discuss various accessories. In addition to AppleVis, take a look at the following sites:
    www.blindbargains.com
    https://doubletaponair.com
    Last but not least, there's YouTube. You might not see the videos, but most of them have sound, and you'll hear products in action. Reviewers are typically good at demonstrating and describing products. You can also ask sighted friends to look at these videos or pictures of a product you're interested in to fill in any details. I wish you the best of good hunting for blind-friendly accessories which suit your particular needs. Be certain to let others know of any particularly successful finds. Write reviews on your own blog or on Applevis so others can share in your good fortune and promote the development of accessible equipment.

A Tour of My iPhone's Home Screens:
Where might your iOS journey take you? There's an old saying that before you can walk, you must first learn to crawl. Before we get to discuss the app store, I want to make certain you're as ready as possible for the difficulties which apps you might purchase could throw at you. This way, it's far more likely that you'll know how to succeed at what you try to do and won't give up in frustration. Several sections following this one are concerned with giving my readers a basic mastery of your iOS device. They discuss how to set up and control your device and how to use many of the apps which come already installed. However, I also know how important it is to be motivated while going through that material. This section is my attempt to give you that motivation by offering you a look ahead. It will also steer you to a lot of high quality accessible apps which you might consider obtaining. I thought I'd give you a quick tour of what currently resides on my own iPhone, after fifteen years of living with one. Think of this section as an opportunity to get a look from the top of the mountain before you start to climb it. I thought it might be helpful for newcomers to have a sense of the choices I've made in terms of apps, so they could begin to consider what they want to explore for themselves. I'll also describe how my most essential apps are arranged on my home screens. Those who have no interest in what apps grace my personal iPhone can safely jump to the next first-level heading. I hope this serves to satisfy curiosity and encourages you to explore beyond the apps that Apple provides. Those are great apps to start out with. However, third parties have often come up with solutions and combined capabilities that can add tremendous value to your iOS device.
    Keep in mind that the discoveries and choices I've made were as much a product of what was available when I needed various capabilities. A lot has happened over the last decade and a half as the current configuration of apps on my iPhone gradually came into being. Don't feel like you need to grab everything I mention here. Think about what you want to do and find out about apps you're considering. What you end up with will doubtless differ substantially from what I have. My iPhone has many apps that don't get used, since other apps have proved more suitable and capable. Other apps were obtained not so much because I required them, as because I wanted to see how accessible they were, instead of the ones I chose as my first picks for accomplishing what I wanted to do. I've always had a fascination with the road not taken. In the iOS ecosystem, finding out what an alternative app is like won't often break the bank. My collection of apps is therefore somewhat large compared to what I would theorize most of my readers would end up with. Nevertheless, this should give you a good idea of the kinds of possibilities that iOS offers. Without further delay, let's get started.
    Welcome to my humble digital abode. Come in and make yourself comfortable. Hang your coats up on the status bar and leave your shoes in the dock. Before we begin, I'll make one thing clear. My iPhone is as much a source of entertainment and mental engagement as it is a working tool. I have avoided the pitfall of thinking of it purely as a device for getting things done. The way I organize my home screens reflects this balanced use. An iPhone can fit into one's life in many ways. People wanting to focus more strongly on productivity, travel, sensing their environment, or entertainment would doubtless organize their apps very differently. No decision made in this area is ever carved in stone. The past few years of pandemic and post-pandemic life have resulted in substantial rearrangement of my various home screens.
    All home screens are numbered starting with page 1. Before page 1, there is the Today view. We will discuss that later in this guide. The number of apps that fit on your dock and home screens will depend on the size of your device. On my iPhone, each home screen can hold up to 24 apps. My dock holds four. I keep apps I use regularly or want to have particularly handy either on my first home screen or in my dock. To be on that default screen, they have to be the apps I turn to first in a relevant situation, or else apps I use the most frequently. Just because an app isn't on the dock or first home screen doesn't mean I value it less. I might simply need it less often than others and not mind swiping through a few home screens to reach it. All that being said, swipe right this way.
The First Home Screen: Tools Used Most Often
I reserve this first home screen for the apps that I most frequently turn to in whatever situation they might apply. This is my virtual desktop of sorts. At the top left, just below the status bar, you'll find a wonderful app built for writers called Ulysses. You're reading the results of its capabilities right now. A flick to the right, the Notes app which comes preinstalled on every iOS device has now reached a point of excellence where it totally meets my need for keeping notes. With Siri integration and the newly added capabilities for note tags and smart folders, I couldn't be happier. Having a separate app for notes and ideas is a very useful thing.
    One flick to the right of the Notes app is the Journal app from Apple. It has won my affection as an excellent, free and simple app which meets my journaling needs quite well. Journaling is a practice I've been trying to get back into since I've stopped blogging regularly about personal life events. There are real therapeutic benefits to writing down one's thoughts. Journaling apps are built specifically for that purpose and have tools to support this practice.
    Flicking right from Journal, we enter my trio of primary reference apps I use most often. These include the Terminology app from Agile Tortoise. Freshly updated, it makes a powerful online tool for wordsmiths, being able to tap into several resources at once. Next comes the indispensable Google app. Whatever you might think of their privacy policies, they really know their stuff when it comes to quickly and efficiently tapping into the Internet for answers and information. That was, after all, Google's original purpose. A new addition is fresh from the minds at Envision AI. They have created the Ally app, which is an artificial intelligence assistant specially devised to help those who are blind in everyday life. Out of habit, I direct most of my AI queries to Siri. However, should I need a more blind-friendly answer, Ally is ready to go. Regardless of circumstances, these apps should prove more than adequate for most situations a casual writer encounters.
    Next come apps that keep me on track. They now include an app called Pommie which is a simple accessible pomodoro timer, as well as the Calendar and Reminders apps included in iOS. The Calculator app from Apple has received a massive upgrade and now amply handles any mathematical questions I'm liable to throw at it. To the right of this is the ElevenReader app from Eleven Labs. In an effort to spread awareness of their AI-powered text to speech voices, they have made this app which lets me hear electronic documents, including my own writing, in very high-quality speech. Very helpful for proofreading, and not a little inflating to my ego to hear my words read aloud by famous actors like Sir Laurence Olivier, Burt Reynolds and others.
    A flick to the right brings us to apps which handle my communications needs in most cases. The Contacts app provides easy access to information about the people and corporations in my circle of life. It is followed by the Gmail, Messages, Mona app for Mastodon and Zoom apps. Zoom proved so frequently used during the ongoing pandemic that it was put on my first home screen and never left. Together, these take care of the bulk of my social and work communication needs. I've somewhat reduced my use of social media platforms over the last couple of years and now focus on Zoom and Mastodon primarily.
    Next are two apps to help me with the real world. The Be My Eyes and VD Scanner apps put artificial intelligence plus my iPhone's camera to work, helping me read printed material and identify objects. If I need to borrow some working eyes to get something done, the Be My Eyes app meets my typical needs in that area as well. It's nice having so much capability in a single app which is free to use.
    We're now within easy finger's reach from the bottom of the screen, where two apps are well positioned to keep me aware of what's happening in the world. Apple's News app makes a fascinating, endless source of current information. It gives me access to current news as well as a wide range of magazines covering all manner of topics. Meanwhile, the Weather app keeps me informed of local conditions outdoors. It has now become good enough to replace the venerable Weather Gods app.
    Completing this home screen's contents are four more apps that don't really group categorically but are, nonetheless, very handy. The Voice Memos app serves as a good basic digital recorder. There are times when I want to record thoughts or information read or spoken by other people. There are many other uses for a basic digital recording app. For more extensive recordings, I have the Ferrite app ready and waiting. This basically puts a multitrack audio editor at my disposal should I ever get ambitious in that department.
    Finally, the Passwords app and Files app completes my first home screen. Both of these apps are part of iOS 18 and made by Apple. The Passwords app is new and gives quick secure access to all passwords, verification codes and paskeys stored in my iCloud keychain. Meanwhile, the Files app provides me with access to the files stored on my iPHONE, as well as in Apple's iCloud and various third-party cloud services.
    Rounding off what I consider to be my work area is my dock, which is at the very bottom of any home screen you happen to be on. In my dock, I have the Phone app at the bottom left. To the right are the Safari web browser, the Settings app, and at the far right, the App Store. These give me access to four very frequently used things that need to be as handy as possible, regardless of which home screen I'm on. While I've sometimes moved one of these apps elsewhere to have a different app take a slot in the dock, at least three of these four have occupied my dock for nearly a decade. I doubt I'll move any more than one of them from the dock at any time.
The Second Home Screen:
Fun Meets Knowledge:
    With a three-finger swipe to the left, moving us onto page 2, I welcome you to "Heaven on iPhone!" This page is where I rest, recharge, and find out answers to the countless idle questions that come to mind, annoying my better half Sara endlessly. This home screen is all about literature, stimulating knowledge, entertainment, and enjoyable media consumption of all kinds. Apps that prove exceptionally valuable in these areas tend to find their way onto this home screen.
    My complete personal library of audio and ebooks take pride of place at the very top. Information access is one of the benefits of owning an iOS device that I find the most liberating and valuable. Even while completely offline, this area gives me access to an inconceivable amount of precious stories, advice, and knowledge about anything I'm likely to be interested in. here, you'll find the Word of Promise Bible that combines a fully accessible and navigable text Bible joined with an audio-dramatized version. The Kewix app has moved to this second home screen. Presuming you can spare the onboard storage space required for the files containing the compressed contents, the Kiwix app provides access to many gigabytes of free reference material. This includes Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and other freely available wiki references. These usually require an Internet connection to search. Provided you have the room to spare, you can download these complete resources onto your device. Due to its splendid accessibility and ease of use, Kiwix has moved from being something kept around for emergencies to being a highly valued primary reference tool. If you ever find yourself in circumstances where cellular and Wi-Fi data is expensive or unavailable, Kiwix will see you through if you have loaded it up with the references you might need. One example might be anybody living in the far northern or rural regions of Canada, where connectivity tends to be far more costly than in more central urban areas. Get to a point where you have Wi-Fi access and download the complete text version of Wikipedia, Wiktionary, and many other references for use when you're offline. You can then easily search all of them from within the same app. Those who don't have the gigabytes to spare for offline references may find the Terminology, Wikipedia and WordWeb apps to be fitting substitutes. They take advantage of constant connectivity to make use of online references.
    Next come the Apple Books, Kindle, VitalSource Bookshelf, Dolphin EasyReader, Audible, and Voice Dream Reader apps. Together, these brim with thousands of informative and entertaining ebooks, audiobooks and dramas I've collected over many years. Voice Dream Reader is one of those "must have" apps. It is tremendously useful as a means of reading ebooks, particularly from independent publishers who provide them in PDF or ePUB formats. It can do a whole lot more, including play zipped MP3 files, which tends to be how audio dramas are often sold digitally outside of industry giants like Audible. The Dolphin EasyReader app lets me access books on the CELA digital library, available to any Canadians who have a disability that makes reading regular print difficult.
    Audible is a commercial service letting me acquire professionally narrated audiobooks as well as shows and audio dramas. Beside these apps are a pair of dedicated homes for world-class audio drama produced by Big Finish Audio and Graphic Audio. Each company has developed their app to aid in the easy enjoyment of their creations. Thankfully, they were well aware of their blind audience and did a splendid job making their apps accessible.
    Now, we enter the territory of streaming audio entertainment. The next apps let me access podcasts, music, radio stations, and other audio delights. The Music app comes next and lets me tap into Apple's massive music library. Furthermore, as of iOS 13, it can be used in conjunction with Siri to quickly tune into any radio station or Internet radio streams I might want to hear. This includes CBC Radio One, the AMI Audio stream, or Internet radio stations like Mushroom FM. The Broadcasts app is a nice home for Internet radio stations which lets me store my favourites with more permanence than the Music app. Rather than asking Siri, I can simply double tap on a button or browse through a list of favourites without invoking Siri.
    Next come the Apple Podcasts, Castro, and TED apps that provide me with an endless source of podcasts and short informative lectures, respectively. Being Canadian, I like my CBC. The dynamic duo of CBC Listen and CBC Gem apps are living proof of that. Past This is the BBC Sounds app. The BBC public service provides some splendid audio and video entertainment from the UK. The NPR app gives me access to stations and shows from National Public Radio. This is the American equivalent to the CBC and BBC.
    After that, I have the AMI, Apple TV, Amazon Prime Video, Twitch, and YouTube video streaming services ready to hand and often used. You might not expect a blind person would be very interested. However, due to increased levels of audio description plus attention paid to making the apps accessible with VoiceOver, these services have become far more attractive and useful than they once were. YouTube is a wealth of interesting and informative content made by people all over the world and put up for all to enjoy.
The Third Home Screen:
The Top Desk Drawer
    Page 3 is a place for utilities, financial apps and apps having to do with physical and mental health. In effect, it is a place for apps of relatively high importance that didn't quite justify a place on the first home screen. At the top left, I have the Natural 20, Game Design, Prompts, and Developer apps. These all have to do with my interests in games, writing, and in the case of the Developer app, my need to understand what Apple is doing for app developers. I have ambitions to create an accessible roleplaying game and to write either a novel or a collection of short stories.
    Next come the Translate, Pages, FindMy and Camera apps. I haven't found the need to use Pages extensively, since Ulysses has done everything I've needed in terms of word processing. However, it's good to have it handy. The Camera app has gained some new capabilities, including the ability to recognize objects and read text. In case I have to take a picture, I keep the app handy. The Translate app is another of Apple's apps which I keep ready on general principles. I have yet to put the app to any serious use, but it seems quite accessible and reasonably capable. The FindMy app has been used more frequently than I care to admit and has helped track down dropped AirPods or misplaced packs which thankfully have AirTags in them.
    The Fitness, Health, and Watch apps are all designed by Apple. These apps are all about mental and physical health. Before breaking my Apple Watch, I frequently made use of the Watch app. Finances permitting, I hope to do so again soon. I supplement these apps with the Headspace and Signia apps. The Headspace app is my favourite app for mindfulness and meditation. I use it daily. Meanwhile, the Signia app can help me adjust my hearing aids and get them connected to my iPhone. It's not the most accessible app and I avoid using it unless I have to. Hearing aids being as important as they are, the app still keeps its place on the third home screen.
    Next come two apps which are all about providing soundscapes. The Nature Space app gives me access to a wide range of natural soundscapes that I find very helpful and pleasant to have playing while I write. Particularly during Winter months, I find it even more useful than music while writing. A newer complementary addition to the page is the myNoise app, which lets you build your own constantly changing soundscapes using different elements of sound.
    Financial and utility related apps also seem to be congregating on the third page these days. First in the group is an app for my bank of choice. This is followed by the Wallet app included in iOS. The apps for my cellular carrier and controlling my home internet service provider sit beside the recently added Resident app, which lets me pay rent and submit maintenance requests for my apartment. The Numbers app, which is there for creating invoices and in case I need to handle other spreadsheets. The app for my insurance company comes next. I very rarely need to use it, but it simply seems to belong with the growing collection of financial and life related apps. Rounding off the group is the recently improved PayPal app, which is very accessible with VoiceOver and constantly being improved. I don't use these apps every day, but when I need them, I head on over to page 3 and put my financial affairs in order.
The Fourth Home Screen:
Utilities, Sensing, and Navigation:
    Page 4 has transformed a great deal over the past couple of years. Taking three swipes to get to from page 1, I tend to think of it like the bottom drawer in my desk. It contains apps which I want to be handy, but aren't used as often as apps on the first three pages. I've also stashed my collection of navigation and sensing apps on the fourth home screen.
    At the top left is the CPMobile app from Coinomatic which I used to pay laundry machines in my building for washing and drying my clothing. Following this app are my collection of apps related to navigation and sensing. These include the venerable BlindSquare app which I've been using for over a decade now to go for walks. The newer Voice Vista app offers a compelling new more sound focussed alternative. The Seeing AI app keeps on getting better and adding new ways to put AI and my iPhone's camera to good use. The Envision AI app gives a slightly different take on the same general idea. Rounding off these seven apps are Transit, Maps, and Google Maps. Between these apps, I can get directions and information about anywhere I need to.
    The next collection of six apps are all made by Apple. They are the Freeform, Photos, Home, Support, Clock, and Mail apps. I don't use these apps very frequently, but when I want them, I know where to go. The Freeform app is a new one which provides an infinite canvas for brainstorming and mental mapping. The Photos app deals with pictures taken on your iPhone. The Clock app has time related functions. The Mail app is for emails. The Support app has any information necessary to get support from Apple. The Home app taps into Apple's Home kit software, which interfaces with smart devices. So far, I only need to use this for configuring my HomePod Mini speakers.
    The rest of the page is taken up with a shifting collection of apps. These currently include apps like Scrivener and Drafts, which I keep as backup word processing and notes apps. The Oxford Dictionary and First Aid apps are there as references. The Streaks app is for making good habits and breaking bad ones. The Things app is the most heavy-duty piece of artillery I've ever come across in terms of organizing one's life projects and hobbies. Currently overkill for my more modest needs, I keep it in case that ever changes.
The Fifth Homescreen:
News, Events and SocialMedia:
    Participating in online life, it appears that everyone has their own preferences for which apps to host events or socialize on. As a result, my fifth page is dedicated to the apps in these areas which I might not prefer to use, but have found are simply necessary often enough to keep handy. The Riverside app is one example. I've needed it to participate in some podcast discussions requiring video. Another one is EventBright. This is a kind of schedule and event coordinating app where you can register for in-person or online events and purchase tickets. Events will be hosted in actual locations or on other online apps like Zoom. The Vfairs app is another conference hosting service which can integrate with other apps like Zoom. It is used to participate in large-scale complex online events such as the CNIB Connect the Dots conference.
    Although the Apple News app lets you tap into a tremendous amount, I sometimes find that other apps can lead to different perspectives on stories. I therefore have several news and information related apps. These include CBC News, TheEconomist, The Guardian, The Toronto Star app, Reddit and Substack. The Apple News app lets me access many of these same resources, but there are occasions when some articles are kept out of it and reserved for people who specifically subscribe to some of these resources separately.
    The rest of the page is a large number of social media apps like Facebook, which I don't use often enough to be on the first home screen but still have to be handy when circumstances demand. Facebook and its Facebook Messenger app are prime examples of services I use a bit grudgingly. A new addition is an audio blogging app called Jacket FM. The X app is kept for those times when it's necessary to use what was once a beacon of social activity called Twitter. Some of these apps are so embedded in people's lives that there are enough reasons to stay on platforms which you'd personally rather were left to history.
    Another aspect of this page is a growing collection of competing AI assistants. I have the Pi, ChatGPT, and Google Gemini apps ready to go. This is in case they prove actually better than Siri or other assistance I have at my disposal.
The Sixth Home Screen:
My Digital Endless Mall
    Page 6 is for shopping and business interaction. On it are shipment trackers, Kickstarter, eBay, etc. You can get damned near anything online these days. Dinner, electronics, groceries, and everything in between. The sixth page is my favourite endless digital mall. Chances are good that a restaurant, delivery service or store's custom-designed app will be accessible. The Apple Store, Amazon, and Shoppers apps are more large-scale retail operations. Meanwhile, some more niche brands have their own apps. A good example of this is the Alpaka app. It was developed by a company which sells well-designed packs, slings, and pouches. Apps like Swiss Chalet or Uber Eats are for ordering meals delivered from local restaurants to my door. Being in the Greater Toronto Area, we can use the Voila delivery app and have groceries delivered as well. It's a hip and happening home screen. You can learn a lot more about these apps in the section called A World Market in Your Pocket.
The Seventh Through Ninth Homescreens:
The Realm of Favourite Games:
    If you counted up all the games which are accessible to blind players available in the app store, you would easily go into the hundreds and possibly exceed 1000. Many of these games are text games. Others make extensive use of sound and action. Pages 7 through 9 on my iPHONE are dedicated to my most favourite games. This has proved far more convenient than having a games folder. As my whims of play change and new games appear, I can easily move games off the pages and into the app library. Some notable choices are Blind Drive, Blindfold Pinball, Dawncaster, Six Ages: Ride Like The Wind, Frotz, Dice World, and Choice Of Games. You can learn about a great many more inhabitants of my gaming pages in the section called Accessible Games on iOS.
Beyond This Point:
Occasionally Useful Odds and Ends
    The rest of my home pages are taken up with apps of all sorts. They aren't very well organized. I keep the pages of apps because I tend to prefer this to making heavy use of the app library. Any apps that are useful every once in a while or might become more useful given this or that improvement, can be found. Here, there is an assortment of navigation apps like Goodmaps Outdoors and Explore that might prove more ideal for certain situations apart from what I commonly experience. I also keep a number of different writing apps, including VD Writer, iA Writer, Wattpad, and several note-taking apps. The Personal Diary app is there. I tend to be more of a blogger, but one never knows. There is a perfect example of one reason I have at least a couple of apps which seem to do the same thing. Natural 20 is still available and takes a very different approach than Ready to Roll did. Sadly, Ready To Roll is no longer available. Natural 20 is now my primary dice roller and has moved to the fourth home screen. There's always the chance that apps I rely on will no longer be available, or that others will improve dramatically and be worthy of more common use. I've experienced things like that many times. There are a number of Internet radio apps like ooTunes and Triode. The ooTunes app in particular has served me well for many years. I tend to use Siri and the Music app that comes with iOS. However, the ooTunes app still occasionally comes in handy. If your country has a public radio service, there are likely apps which help you find out about and listen to shows. I have apps for Radio New Zealand, Ireland, and Australia among others.
    There are other apps that struck me as a good idea to grab while they were free or on sale. Everything from fitness apps to messaging apps I've never had occasion to use. Many of the apps I cover later in this guide are ones that I briefly researched for review purposes or as possible different choices to what I've gravitated to.
    Part of the reason for my reluctance to remove apps is how very tiny most apps actually are. The Audible and Music apps are perhaps as much as 100 megabytes combined. The Music app is less than 20 megabytes. Yet, I have easily 50 gigabytes of data in the form of audiobooks and music albums consuming space on my iPhone. Most apps don't require much data at all, so why get rid of them? It's not like my iPhone is any heavier carrying them around. Some apps have been superseded by others. Others await possible updates or changes in my own circumstances that might make them more useful or preferable. There's no hard limit to how many apps there can be on your device, besides the amount of onboard storage you're willing to fill with them. I therefore find it expedient to keep them around in case they are radically improved to the point of deserving a spot on the first nine home screens. This has happened more often than I would have bet on over the past decade as accessibility awareness has grown and Apple's accessibility tools have improved. Every so often, I rummage around in this virtual basement and emerge with something shiny and useful that I suddenly remember I have. It's always wonderful to discover that an app that was once utterly useless due to inaccessibility has now become a joy to use.
Reflections on Fifteen Years of Treasure Hunting:
Overall, I've found it exhilarating to be gathering the tools and games that have formed the real heart of my iOS experience. As things have developed, I've spent a lot of time on the cutting edge. That edge does tend to cut every so often. Several apps that I once greatly enjoyed have disappeared from the app store or simply stopped working for lack of upkeep. Others have been with me nearly since the beginning of my journey.
    I hope this brief glance at what's on my own iPhone is helpful to you as you start building your own collection. At the very least, I hope it gives you a greater sense of the kinds of things that your iOS device makes possible. I discuss many of these apps in greater detail in appropriate sections of this guide. Finding a good way to arrange your apps, so you can develop a sense of where they are, is pretty important. I've been in plenty of situations where I haven't wanted to tell Siri out loud to open a given app. At the end of this guide, I will offer more reflections on my overall journey with iOS. You may also want to look at the section called "The Apple Ecosystem". Together, this should give you a sense of the economics of the environment you're operating in. Thankfully, prices for apps are low enough that you won't go broke trying apps that prove less than ideal or inaccessible. Now that I've shown you around, let's move on.

The VoiceOver Screen Reader and Interface:
Much is made of how easy it is for sighted people to pick up and intuitively learn how to use iOS devices. There is somewhat more of a learning curve for blind people who wish to achieve a similar degree of total control. First made available for iOS devices when the iPhone 3 GS was released in June 2009, VoiceOver has matured into a robust combination of screen reader and interface.
    Simply put, VoiceOver lets blind people use iOS devices with their hands touching the screen or via external devices. It reads information displayed on the screen and allows blind people to control their device completely and with competence. Typically, this is done via gestures performed on the touchscreen on your device with output provided via synthetic speech and sound cues. However, it is possible to use external accessories such as Braille displays and Bluetooth keyboards. Rather than synthetic speech, output can come through a Braille display. This makes it possible for individuals who are deaf blind to make use of iPhones. Other accessibility features and tools, including Voice Control and physical controller accessories, can be used in conjunction with VoiceOver if necessary.
    People who can see are able to simply look at the entire contents of the touchscreen and tap on a desired icon to activate it. They can evaluate their options before touching their device, looking before they leap as it were. Being unable to see the screen, the system must behave differently to allow blind people to explore and absorb its contents before any action happens. Having things activate as soon as they were tapped on would be disastrous for blind people. Therefore, VoiceOver changes how your device behaves so that you can feel around and find the correct letter, number, or icon, and then tap twice on it quickly to indicate your intentional and informed choice. There are also special gestures that make controlling things easier. For sighted people, these gestures would be counterintuitive and harder to master than the more immediate effects which are possible when you can see everything at a glance before interacting with your device.
    VoiceOver does what other screen readers like NVDA for Windows computers do. It has a philosophy that encourages you to explore the screen with your finger and thereby gain an understanding of where things are. If there's one thing to always bear in mind, it's that you should never presume that everything is read out automatically. Always take the time to fully explore the screen of an app to make certain you know about all that is present, including available options. It is possible to reach everything by flicking left and right between elements. They will be moved to in left to right, top to bottom order provided they aren't obscured or hidden. However, that can prove a slow and tedious way to navigate a busy screen full of information and controls. Learning where things are allows you to touch an area on or near the element of interest and flick quickly to what you want. Gaining familiarity with apps and screens so that you can do this will make up for some of the efficiency blind people lose by being forced to absorb information in more sequential structured ways. This also gives you, as a blind person, the ability to truly have a sense of how an app is laid out on the screen. Keep in mind that some elements, such as buttons or options, only actually appear while something else is in focus or after something has happened. VoiceOver doesn't always read changes out loud automatically, so I encourage people not to rely exclusively on flicking left and right.
    VoiceOver does a lot, including changing how your iOS device responds to touches and other gestures. Using VoiceOver lets me read a web page, fill in a form on that page, and interact. Siri, on the other hand, would simply take me to the page and leave me stranded if sighted help or VoiceOver weren't available. I can surf the web with ease using several browsers, filling out forms and shopping online. I can write a document, such as this guide, using an award-winning writing app called Ulysses due to its developers adding support for VoiceOver. While in the Word of Promise Bible app, I can quickly navigate and read the Old and New Testaments with ease and efficiency. Because of VoiceOver, I can play a complex game like Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind, reding the results of my moves and selecting options with as much skill and confidence as any sighted player. Provided an app supports VoiceOver, I can make use of its controls and interface. This even includes really visual apps such as the Camera app and the Maps GPS app.
    While much of VoiceOver's capability is in the user's control, a great deal of how well it works with various apps is actually in the hands of more conscientious and disability-aware app developers. Apple provides many options they can use behind the scenes to effect how well VoiceOver and other accessibility tools work with their apps. Not being a programmer, I have only a very basic grasp of the level of effort required to make use of these options or exactly how they work. I don't have a sense of how much extra information and effort app developers need to know about and apply in order to create more delightful, intuitive experiences for VoiceOver users. My only insights into this come through using a great many apps over many years, plus the contact I've had with app developers when issues have arisen. I can tell you that extra efforts are indeed required for such gains above and beyond basic accessibility. It's not like developers can simply check a box and add optimum VoiceOver support. Therefore, this section is mainly focused on elements of VoiceOver that are within the user's control. However, it's important for people to be aware that proactive developers who take the time to understand how VoiceOver works have a lot of latitude to optimize the experience of blind users. Should you find an app to be inaccessible, make certain developers are aware of the ability they have to broaden their potential audience by using accessibility tools including VoiceOver. You and they can find out a lot about how things work behind the scenes by looking at the developer resources found at:
    www.apple.com/accessibility
    Typing on a touchscreen is a perfect example of both how deeply VoiceOver changes the iOS experience and how flexible it can be. For sighted people, simply tapping on a letter or number found on an app's onscreen keyboard would result in that character being entered. Such a situation would be quite untenable for a blind person, especially while he or she was just learning where keys were. Therefore, VoiceOver provides three alternative typing modes or styles.
    Overall, the philosophy of VoiceOver is to offer more than one approach to things so that people with varying abilities can ultimately accomplish tasks. There may be methods that are faster for most people, but you shouldn't feel that there is a right or wrong method. Find what works best for you among the options provided. It's well worth your time to experiment and try different methods again once you've gained more general proficiency. Through this process of trying methods out, you'll come up with your own best practices.
General Help and Hints:
While VoiceOver has steadily gained more capabilities over its development, learning how to use that power has traditionally been more challenging than it might have been. Thankfully, in iOS 18, Apple has taken a big step forward in finally addressing this needlessly longstanding deficiency. There is now, a decade later than should have been the case, a tutorial built into iOS to help blind users master the operation of VoiceOver. It can be found in the VoiceOver settings. Ask Siri to "open VoiceOver settings." To get there manually, double tap on Settings. Next, flick right until you get to Accessibility and double tap on that. Next, flick right until you come to VoiceOver. Double tap on this. Next, flick right until you come to VoiceOver tutorial. Double tap on this and you'll be on the collections page.
    The tutorial is divided up into collections of lessons. Each lesson explains a particular concept or gesture, and then gives you an opportunity to practice before moving onto the next lesson. Once you have completed the lessons in a collection, you will return to the collections page. You will be told what the next lesson in the tutorial is. Also, you can look to see what collections are coming up ahead. You can continue onto the next lesson, double tap on a different collection, or go back to the previous lesson if you wish. All of this is done by flicking left or right with one finger and tapping twice quickly on what you want.
    During the tutorial, VoiceOver will be restricted in its operation so that you won't accidentally leave the tutorial or cause something to happen which you may not expect. To leave the tutorial and remove these temporary restrictions, double tap on the "done" button found on every tutorial page in the middle near the top of the screen below the status bar.
    I would encourage all beginners to go through the tutorial sequentially in its entirety. Once you've done that, you can always return to the tutorial and go through particular collections to refresh your memory. The tutorial teaches all the crucial aspects of VoiceOver. Having completed it successfully, you'll know enough about how it works so you can navigate your iPhone and do things like type in text. Over time, you can gain proficiency using various apps. Now that you know the basic gestures, the other helpful tools discussed below will be of greater benefit to you.
    To help beginners learn how to do things, VoiceOver also offers a Practice mode that lets you safely practice gestures or key commands if you're using a Braille display or Bluetooth Keyboard. You can enter and leave this mode by tapping the screen twice quickly with four fingers at once. While in this mode, VoiceOver will respond to any touches or gestures by briefly explaining what that gesture would accomplish outside of Practice mode.
    Another extremely useful facility included with VoiceOver are Hints. These are enabled by default and give new users small doses of instruction as they navigate the screen. If, for some reason, you aren't hearing helpful sentences like "slide up and down with one finger to adjust the value", or "double tap to open", then you have somehow managed to disable Hints. Here is how to reach that setting and enable them:
How to Enable VoiceOver Hints
Presuming you're finished setting up and your device is connected to cellular data or Wi-Fi, you can simply hold in the Home or Action button until a beep is heard and say "show VoiceOver settings". Siri will then take you there, provided that Siri understood your words.
2. If Siri isn't available to you, find the Settings app on your home screen and double tap that.
3. Flick right through the settings until you come to Accessibility and double tap that.
4. Next, flick right until you find VoiceOver and double tap that. This works when VoiceOver is activated. If you're instructing a sighted person how to do this while VoiceOver is deactivated, they simply need to tap once on the icons mentioned above.
5. This area allows you to configure how VoiceOver behaves. We'll be coming back here often while learning about VoiceOver. Flick right until you hear Verbosity and double tap this. Then, flick right until you hear hints. It will indicate whether they are enabled or disabled. Double tap on the Hints option to toggle it on or off.
6. To exit this section of Settings, you can hit the Back button to return to the VoiceOver settings, or else hit the Home button or use the equivalent gesture to exit Settings altogether.
There are many settings you can adjust that change how VoiceOver behaves and what it speaks. They are all found in the VoiceOver section of the Settings app, with the important exception of one. This exception is called the Accessibility Shortcut, and before we go any further, we will set that to VoiceOver. This will let you turn VoiceOver on or off via the Home or power buttons depending on how old your iPhone is. More modern iPhones don't have a home button. Once the shortcut is set, invoke it to turn VoiceOver on or off by pressing the appropriate button three times quickly. Useful in countless situations, such as if VoiceOver stops speaking due to a bug in the system, or when using apps that are self-voicing and don't need VoiceOver running to be used. Many games do this. Here's another use case. You may want to turn off VoiceOver quickly to let a sighted friend make use of your iPhone. To set this shortcut:
How to Set the Accessibility Shortcut to VoiceOver
1. Find and double tap the Settings app.
2. Flick right until you come to Accessibility and double tap this.
3. Flick right through all the settings, or tap once with four fingers at the bottom of the screen. Then, if you're on "per app settings", flick once to the left until you come to Accessibility Shortcut and double tap this.
4. Flick right until you come to VoiceOver and double tap this.
5. Tap the Home button to get out of Settings, or use the Back button at the top left of the screen to go back to the previous branch of the settings tree.
If the accessibility shortcut is being used for more than just VoiceOver, any options selected will appear on the screen when the shortcut is invoked. You must then choose VoiceOver from among the available choices. These are located in a menu near the bottom of the screen. Remember that VoiceOver won't be activated until it is chosen, so this menu behaves differently. Rather than flicking through options and double tapping on what you want, you'll need to drag your finger over the screen until you find VoiceOver among the choices. Once you find that, simply lift your finger off the screen and VoiceOver will then turn on.
    Getting to VoiceOver settings can be done in a few ways. Presuming you're all set up and connected to the Internet, the quickest way to get there is:
1. Hold the Home or Action button down until you hear a beep.
2. Say "show VoiceOver settings".
3. You should be placed in the correct section within the Settings app, regardless of where you were before you invoked Siri.
4. Otherwise, from your home screen, double tap the Settings app.
5. Flick right until you hear Accessibility and double tap this.
6. Flick right until you hear VoiceOver On Button and double tap this.
There are many settings that change how VoiceOver behaves to suit your liking. This includes everything from how rapidly the voice speaks, to whether punctuation is announced, to which style of Braille is used if you connect a Braille display to your device, etc. We will discuss all of these in a later part of this section. However, there is one last very welcome new addition to this area. Near the top of VoiceOver settings, you will find an option called "What's new in VoiceOver". This will contain information about the most recent changes and additions. Yet another thing which should have been standard since Voiceover was invented. Now, with these new additions, it is actually feasible for beginners to learn basic VoiceOver use and capabilities without resorting to information that isn't on their iPhone.
Key Gestures:
There are many gestures that you will use to control your iOS device. These gestures will involve from one to four fingers. If you find it easier, you can perform these with fingers from each hand. Sensors on the surface of your device will detect the differences between finger movements.
The Touch:
The touch is the most basic of gestures. It is accomplished by touching the surface of your device with a single finger. This announces the item you happen to place your finger upon. The item will be read aloud, but not activated. You can safely touch all over the screen to your heart's content and develop a sense of where things are. This is true in all areas, including inside apps you may be using.
The Tap:
A tap is accomplished by quickly striking and then lifting one or more fingers from your device. There are taps using from one to four fingers, involving up to four strikes in quick succession. When using VoiceOver, there is no single-finger tap. This is regarded as a touch. A single tap with two fingers will cause VoiceOver to pause or resume speech. Very handy during book reading and on plenty of other occasions. A three-finger tap will read an item summary or report status information such as your position within a document. Finally, tapping with four fingers near the top or bottom of the screen will quickly move your cursor to the top or bottom, respectively.
The Double Tap:
This gesture comes in variations involving from one to four fingers. In all cases, the touchscreen is struck twice in quick succession. Presuming you haven't changed the Double Tap Timeout setting, the default speed is like what one might imagine the speed of a stereotypical heartbeat or quick knocks on a door would be. The single-finger double tap, simply called the double tap, is used to activate things. It lets VoiceOver know that you intend to activate an item, rather than simply find out what it is. Touching a button called Play would merely cause VoiceOver to inform you of the button's function. Performing a double tap on the button would cause it to activate, which would perhaps cause music to play. Double tapping on a button called OK would cause it to be pressed. Double tapping on a selected app on your home screens would cause the app to launch.
The Two-Finger Double Tap:
This variant of the double tap is sometimes called the "magic" tap. Its results will vary depending on the context in which it is used. Normally, it will cause the most recent app to have played audio to pause or resume playback. This is useful when you're busy with another app. Rather than having to switch into the app playing audio, pause it, and return to the email you didn't quite catch, you can quickly do a two-finger double tap while in the email. This pauses the audio, making it easier to review whatever part of the email you didn't quite catch without being distracted by the additional audio. Should you receive a phone call, the two-finger double tap can be used to answer it, and then hang up when you're finished. It will also perform functions specified by app developers. For instance, while in the Mona app, performing this gesture gives instant access to the post composition screen so you can type in your thoughts with minimal delay.
The Two-Finger Double Tap and Hold:
This gesture involves making a two-finger double tap and then holding your fingers down after the second tap. Wait until a short tone sounds, and then lift your fingers off the screen. This puts you in a mode that makes it possible to label buttons and other improperly labelled parts of an app you want to use. This could make otherwise inaccessible apps become useable. If developers or sighted helpers inform blind people about what the element or button is supposed to be labelled as, this gesture lets you input those labels, so the app is more accessible.
The Three-Finger Double Tap:
This gesture will turn speech on or off. This is not the same as turning off VoiceOver. You may want to do this if you are making use of a Braille display. Braille is all handled through the VoiceOver feature. Therefore, if you prefer not to be interrupted by speech chattering away as you try to read lecture notes or a book in Braille, you should use this gesture to turn off speech. All VoiceOver gestures will still behave normally. Also, the small sounds VoiceOver uses to alert you to various things will continue to function. Simply perform another three-finger double tap to cause VoiceOver to resume speaking. Turning VoiceOver off and then back on will automatically have it resume the default behaviour of speaking.
Entering Quick Settings:
To reach a collection of VoiceOver settings you may want to adjust frequently, use a two finger quadruple tap. Take two fingers and tap them four times together rapidly on the touchscreen. You can then adjust these settings before returning to where you were via the "Done" button or the home gesture.
Entering Help Mode:
VoiceOver contains a Practice mode that allows you to become accustomed to performing various gestures without causing unintended consequences. You can enter this mode by employing a four-finger double tap. With four fingers spaced apart in a manner allowing the tips of all to touch the screen at once, strike the screen twice rapidly. VoiceOver should announce "starting help" followed by instructions on how you can exit this mode. This is done by the exact same gesture used to enter it. As I explain various gestures, you can enter this mode and master them. Should you wish to control your device with a Braille display, Bluetooth keyboard, or some other method, this mode will be helpful in determining which buttons or keys on your hardware perform various functions. With a Bluetooth keyboard, use the VoiceOver key and the letter "k". The Escape key exits Help. On a Braille display, hold down the spacebar and hit the letter "k" to enter and exit Help.
The Triple Tap:
Tapping quickly three times with one or more fingers is called a triple tap. The one-finger triple tap is used to access context menus. There are all sorts of context menus. Performing a triple tap on the app store icon, I find options which will let me remove the app, get to where I can check for app updates, get to where I can search for apps, and still more options in a context menu. One option you will always find last in a context menu is the Dismiss Context Menu option. This returns you to whatever was present prior to you invoking the context menu. Try this out in various places where you suspect there may be available contextual options.
    One example of where this context menu access comes in handy is in the Ulysses app I used to write this guide. There are times when you want to search for all instances of a word or phrase and replace them with something different. I got into the habit of putting a hyphen between "double" and "tap". Later, I learned that they were written as completely separate words. I therefore had to change all the hyphens in "double-tap" to spaces. To accomplish this, I invoked the Search function in Ulysses. I then entered "double" followed by the hyphen. Next, I moved to the Search button and flicked down on the rotor, reaching Access Search Options. Double tapping this, I flicked right and double tapped on Replace. This brought up a second edit field where I could enter the replacement text. I then felt around the bottom right of the screen to find the Replace button. On its own, it would replace one instance. I wanted to replace all instances. I therefore triple tapped on the Replace button, invoking its context option. Flicking right, I found and double tapped on Replace All, and my task was complete. I just hope I remembered to do this in all the sheets in the guide.
    This is the sort of thing you'll want to check for in apps you use extensively. Over the years, I've developed a sense of where they might be found. The Replace All option in Ulysses was initially anything but obvious to me. However, Once I discovered it, I began exploring other apps mor thoroughly and found numerous options similarly situated. These tend to be options that are sometimes very useful, but not always needed. App developers want them handy, but don't want them cluttering up the ordinary activity displayed while an app is used. It's one of those conventions of iOS that can be less friendly to beginners who don't think to check for these extra options.
Reaching Live Recognition:
Tapping with four fingers three times in quick succession will allow you to access live recognition without requiring the rotor. This feature is discussed in its own section. In essence, live recognition takes advantage of artificial intelligence and your iPhone's camera to describe what it sees and identify objects. This method may prove easier for beginners who haven't mastered the rotor yet.
The Swipe:
This gesture isn't specific to VoiceOver. To effect a swipe, you quickly move the appropriate number of fingers across the screen. Your fingers should be moving in a direction as they touch the screen so that a swipe is interpreted correctly. Think of it like brushing claws across the screen.
    A one finger swipe left or right will move to the previous or next item on the screen. The one finger upward and downward swipe moves you to the previous or next rotor item. This is whatever the rotor is set to such as character, word, etc.
    A two finger swipe upward will cause VoiceOver to read from the top of the screen or document. A two finger downward swipe is how to cause VoiceOver to "read all". In other words, VoiceOver will read continuously down a screen or through a document until you stop it with a touch or pause it with a one finger double tap.
    The two finger left and right swipe gestures are used in the group navigation introduced in iOS 15. A two finger swipe to the left moves you out of a group. A right swipe moves you into a group.
    Three finger swipes are used to scroll in the opposite direction that you swipe. For example, a three finger swipe left will scroll to the right. If you were reading a book, think of a three finger swipe left like turning to the next page and a right swipe like turning back to the previous page. Similarly, three finger swipes up or down will scroll to the lower or higher screen area of a long document or block of information larger than what fits on your device's screen.
    The four finger swipe to the left or right can be used to quickly move between various apps you have open. This causes a different app to be the one in focus and running in the foreground. This can be more convenient than using the app switcher. Especially if you remember how many swipes to do in order to reach a desired app. The downward four finger swipe is used as a way to initiate the "type to Siri" function from anywhere you might be. You can then type a command or question, which Siri will attempt to answer or act upon. This is useful when you're in circumstances where you don't want to speak to Siri. For instance, while in a quiet room or meeting. The upward four finger swipe is unassigned by default. Using the "commands" section of VoiceOver settings, you could put this gesture to use in a great many ways.
The Item Chooser
Tapping three times with two fingers will cause you to enter the Item Chooser. This is a useful mode when navigating apps with a lot on their screens. It sets out all the interactive elements that you can then flick left and right through and examine, unhindered by the rest of what an app might be displaying. Double tapping on an item will select it. To exit the Item Chooser without making a selection, simply press the Home button if your device has one, or implement the appropriate gesture by sliding your finger from the bottom and lifting it after the first beep.
Typing Modes and Typing Feedback
Right from the beginning as you set up your device, understanding how to type using the onscreen keyboard is absolutely essential. Doing this efficiently can be quite a challenge, especially for blind beginners who are used to typing on physical keyboards. In this subsection, we will examine the three approaches offered by the VoiceOver interface. We will also cover the options for receiving feedback while typing. My advice is to take it slow and careful while getting the hang of things. I kept wanting to fly along at the same sort of speed I can manage on a physical keyboard. This was never a reasonable expectation. Even after years of constant practice, I'm nowhere near as fast. I use a physical keyboard for any lengthy writing I do on my iPhone. However, within a month of getting my first iPhone, I was able to reach a point where I could answer text messages and do other short writing at a speed that didn't leave people waiting for ages. I hope these explanations help you figure out which one of the three approaches will best suit your needs.
    To adjust typing style feedback settings, go into VoiceOver settings and flick right until you reach the "Typing" button. Double tap this, and you'll then be in the area to make adjustments.
    VoiceOver offers three different typing modes or styles. Apple has never settled on either of these terms, and uses them interchangeably in the documentation and in iOS itself. When you find them in the rotor, they're referred to as "Typing Mode". In VoiceOver settings, they are referred to as "Typing Style". These styles are called Standard, Touch, and Direct Touch. Let's discuss each of these in turn:
Standard Typing:
The style selected by default is the most friendly for beginners. Using this method, you are free to take all the time you need to feel around the keyboard until you find the character you wish to enter. Alternatively, you can flick left or right to move through the various keys in top to bottom left to right sequence. Once you have found the character you want, you can lift your finger and then tap twice quickly to enter that character. If you find that this requires too much coordination, you can perform what is known as a "split tap". To accomplish this, keep your finger held down on the character you want. While doing this, use another finger to tap once anywhere on the screen. This will type the character, and it will be spoken, so you know that it was typed. For example, I might want to enter the letter "a". Feeling around the left side of the keyboard, I find the "a" hearing it spoken. At that point, I lift my finger from the keyboard but keep its position above the "a" character. I then tap twice quickly to enter the "a". Alternatively, I could use a split tap by keeping my finger on the "a" and using another finger, perhaps on my free hand, to tap anywhere else on the screen. I would then hear the "a" spoken as it was entered.
    This style offers the maximum level of forgiveness while people become used to typing on a keyboard modelled after the QWERTY keyboard but on a flat surface and much smaller than a standard physical keyboard. You can take all the time you need and feel where keys are without worrying about accidentally entering anything. Nothing happens unless you use a double tap or split tap to firmly indicate your intentions. This includes the Delete and Return buttons, and the more Numbers, more Letters and more Symbols toggle button which give access to those different sets of characters.
Touch Typing:
While very forgiving, many people eventually find that the Standard Typing style is cumbersome. The Touch Typing style offers the potential for much greater speed in exchange for some of the forgiveness offered by Standard Typing. Once you have developed enough of a mental map to know roughly where characters are on the screen, it normally doesn't take much time to find the right one. Using the Touch Typing style, you can put your finger on the keyboard and then slide your finger around to find the correct key, keeping your finger on the screen. When you come to the right character, simply lift your finger, and it will be entered instantly. This style is the one I like best. I moved to it within months of getting my first iPhone. Just don't leave your finger in one spot for more than a second or so. If you do, an alternative set of symbols will appear for you to select from. These symbols are ones that aren't used quite as often, but are nonetheless handy. These include symbols for different currencies, accents, and many more. Provided you keep moving your finger, this switch won't occur. The worst that can happen is that you'll have to delete a symbol you didn't actually want.
    You gain speed by not having to be as accurate, since you can quickly slide your finger to the correct character. You then quickly lift the finger to have the character entered and place it at or near the next needed character. I found this method far more intuitive and speedy for me. You don't need to double tap or split tap all the time and can just zip along.
Direct Touch Typing:
This style is for people with superb muscle memory and hand coordination. Essentially, VoiceOver gets out of the way, allowing you to simply touch characters and have them be entered instantly. This is precisely how sighted people would type on their devices. They can simply touch the desired keys to have the desired result happen. In effect, this typing mode offers maximal speed for people with the coordination and precision required to make use of it. However, as it is for people with sight, the tradeoff is absolutely no forgiveness for errant placement of one's fingertip. Those who don't have the needed hand coordination, steadiness, precise positional memory and awareness, will find Direct Touch typing an exercise in utter frustration. They will need to delete wrongly entered characters constantly.
Obtaining Feedback While Typing:
Most screen readers refer to this as "typing echo". The basic idea is that when characters are entered, you can choose what kind of feedback you receive. There are four choices here.
    The first is "none", to have no feedback at all. This is what I prefer when I use a reliable physical keyboard. Characters won't be spoken when entered. If you're using an onscreen keyboard, you will still hear the characters your finger moves over.
    The next choice is "characters". This results in hearing characters when you find them onscreen, as well as hearing the same character spoken again when entered. This gives you confidence that you know precisely what ends up being entered rather than felt, so you know that your finger didn't slip to a wrong character.
    The next choice is "words". Rather than reading each character entered, you will instead hear words as they are completed by a space or punctuation mark. This gives you the confidence of hearing the words when they're completed. It can be less annoying than hearing each character spoken twice.
    The final choice is "characters and words". It speaks each character entered plus the words you complete, giving you maximum feedback. This could potentially be useful in situations where noise level or other distraction is high.
    You can select which kind of typing feedback you prefer in the VoiceOver settings. Simply double tap the choice you want, and it will be marked as selected. This is also where you will find the Typing Style setting. While the rotor may also be used to switch between typing styles, you cannot use it to select your preferred typing feedback. To accomplish this, you will always need to go into the full VoiceOver settings or use the quick settings introduced in iOS15. I find that while using the onscreen keyboard, the "characters" feedback choice works best for me. Should my finger slide while being lifted from the screen, I'll know right away that a wrong character was entered. Meanwhile, if I'm typing on a physical keyboard that I'm familiar with and can fully trust, I tend to prefer "no feedback". This lets me write the most efficiently.
An Input Method for Braille users:
People who are skilled in Braille have another way to type on the touchscreen and take control of their iPhones. Braille Screen Input, BSI for short, lets you type using virtual Braille keys right on your touchscreen. As of iOS 18, a new command mode has been added to this input method making extensive control possible. To learn all about Braille Screen Input, find the subsection in the section of this guide called Braille on IOS Devices.
The Rotor:
One of the first things I heard about when people began telling me about VoiceOver was the rotor. I'm old enough to remember rotary dials on telephones I used as a child. That gave me an instant grasp of how this idea was supposed to work. A lot of things used to have knobs that you would turn to control them. In this era of flat touchscreens and buttons, people aren't as familiar with turning dials and knobs. Especially younger people. I guess it's perfectly possible to be in one's twenties and never have had the experience of turning a dial or knob. For me, this concept was an absolutely delightful no-brainer. I took to it immediately.
    Your iOS experience will be infinitely better if you take the time to learn the VoiceOver rotor. Apple has used it to make navigation, and many other things, easier and more efficient for blind people. Imagine a knob sticking out from your screen. It can be anywhere on the screen that is most comfortable for you. The size of the knob is also whatever is comfortable for you, provided there's at least a little space between the two fingertips you'll use to turn the knob. Place the tips of two fingers on the screen as if you were gently pinching a small marble between them. You then turn that imaginary knob left or right with your fingers. This rotates through a circular menu of options that determine what flicking upward or downward with one finger will do. I got used to this within an hour of getting my iPhone, although some of the implications took a bit longer to find natural.
    To get used to this sort of thing, the easiest place to start is by adjusting slider controls for things you can immediately hear, like speaking rate or volume. For sliders like speech rate or volume, turn the rotor until you hear what you want to adjust. Once that's done, merely flicking up or down would adjust the value. For instance, if you turn the rotor to Speaking Rate and flick up with one finger, the rate of speech will get faster. Once you're happy with the speaking rate or other value you've adjusted, turn the rotor to a safe setting like Headings, Characters, or Words. This way, you won't suddenly be surprised when the speed changes or the volume goes down if you happen to flick up or down accidentally. Remember that the rotor is always pointed at something. If you can't remember what that is, simply turn it left or right, and it will announce what it points at. The rotor is absolutely never pointing at nothing.
    While the rotor is circular and will wrap around back to the first option if you keep turning it in the same direction, that isn't always the case for flicking up or down. If your rotor is set to Speaking Rate and you flick down to 0%, flicking down again won't shoot up to the top value. On the other hand, if you set the rotor to Voices, and flick up or down, it will wrap so that you'll keep cycling through your available active choices. You don't have to flick back through them.
    Something that really threw me for a loop at first was moving through documents. I was used to doing that with arrow keys, where you could move left or right when proceeding by character or word, and up or down to move by lines. Using an iOS device without a physical keyboard, you'd turn the rotor to Characters or Words and then move up or down to go backward or forward along the current line, respectively. Instead of holding down a key to move by words, the trick is to turn the rotor to the amount you want to move by, and then flick up or down once for each unit you intend to travel. That holds true for Lines and Headings, so it's actually more consistent. Meanwhile, if you flick left or right while in an edit field, you move out of that field to the closest element in the rest of the app in sequence top to bottom and left to right. An edit field is a single element containing your document. Other elements may be options such as an Edit or Settings button or Document Export button. Some apps have a Word Count or other status information that may be treated as one or more display elements within an app. The rotor, therefore, helps you navigate within your document or within other single elements rather than moving to other parts of an app.
    There are a few different kinds of options that can be on the rotor. Before we go any farther, let's go over the various types, so you have a sense of what you're working with as you explore.
Navigational Rotor Options:
Navigational options are on the rotor to help you move quickly through whatever information or controls you might need as you use your device. For instance, turning the rotor to the Words setting lets you move forward or backward by one word at a time. The Headings setting lets you jump back or forward through a document or web page by heading. This can be a very efficient way of moving through to areas of interest. A particularly noteworthy setting in the navigational category is the Vertical Navigation setting that lets you move directly up or down via upward or downward flicks. This can make reading maps and tables, and even examining game boards, easier.
    A good many of these options are particularly useful for browsing websites. Depending on how much control you want, removing some of these options can declutter your rotor. For instance, I like moving to the next or prior link but don't need to move to the next Non-Visited Link. Similarly, I don't have the option to move to the next Text Field on my rotor, but appreciate the one that moves you to the next or prior Form Control. To make these movements, you need only flick up or down with one finger once you turn the rotor to the desired setting.
Sliders and Switches:
Sliders and switches are similar rotor options. Simply turn to what you want to adjust and flick up or down. If you're dealing with a slider, the value will increase if you flick upward or decrease if you flick downward. For example, turning the rotor to Speaking Rate and flicking downward will slow the rate of speech down. Flicking up would cause the rate of speech to increase. Sliders like Volume and Speaking Rate don't rap around. When you try to move past 0% for Volume, it won't suddenly fly up to 100% and yell at you. To gain volume back again, you'll need to flick upward with one finger.
    Switches will allow you to turn a feature on or off. Unlike actual switches, flicking in the same direction will toggle the setting between any alternative positions. I will often do this with the Audio Ducking option. This option determines whether any other audio, such as music you're playing, automatically drops in volume while VoiceOver speaks. This is a very handy feature that makes certain that what VoiceOver says to you will never be drowned out by music or an action movie, etc. When I'm working, I quite frequently turn on Audio Ducking. I simply turn to the Audio Ducking setting and flick either up or down to reach my preferred setting of always. Either direction will do, since all you're doing is cycling between three selections, those being "when speaking", "always", or off. Other switches work the same way, such as those for VoiceOver Hints and for Sounds.
    This Sounds setting refers to VoiceOver-related audio cues. These short and relatively unobtrusive noises help indicate movement to new lines and other events without the need for spoken words that might break up the flow of information. I would advise beginners to leave both Audio Ducking and Sounds in the on position while they learn how to use VoiceOver. Both are very useful features and should only be turned off when there's a good reason.
    Why, you might well wonder, would anyone want to turn off features like these? Sometimes, features meant to be helpful can get in your way when you're trying to do things as rapidly as possible. You might not want to always hear hints once you're a competent VoiceOver user. Here's another example: With Audio Ducking, there are many occasions, like when listening to a show, where you really don't want some random notification causing VoiceOver to prevent you from hearing what someone in the show says. That's when it's good to be able to turn the rotor to Audio Ducking and flick up or down to turn the feature off. This can also be helpful if you're chatting with one or more people and don't want to miss out on what they're saying due to the volume of the conversation dropping whenever VoiceOver speaks.
Special Positions:
Some rotor settings are special ones. For example, the Braille Screen Input setting will activate that method of input whenever the rotor is set there. You need not double tap to execute this choice. Merely turn the rotor to that setting, and you're off and running. The same goes for the Handwriting setting that lets you write characters on the screen rather than typing them. To dismiss these input methods, you need only turn the rotor to another setting.
    If you turn the rotor to Actions, you uncover a menu of all actions you can take given the current element in focus. Flicking up or down moves through that context-sensitive menu, and double tapping on a choice executes it. If you move over an element where actions are available, the rotor will automatically turn to Actions unless you change that setting so the rotor never turns on its own. One example of this is when you delete a voice from your iOS device. That takes advantage of the Actions setting. Another place where you'll find Actions is when you move to a song in the Music app. Flicking up or down will cycle through available Actions.
    This can sometimes be annoying when you're moving over the editing field of a word-processing app. If you forget to double tap on that field, thereby entering editing mode, you will find a series of Actions rather than the words you might have expected when you flick up or down to navigate the document.
    It's always a good idea to check different parts of an app if you hear VoiceOver say "actions available". This is one way in which VoiceOver lets blind people access things that might be visible on toolbars in an app's display. Another is the Edit rotor setting. This makes it possible to Cut, Copy, and Paste text, as well as perform other tasks associated with editing. Similar to when using the ACTIONS menu, you need to double tap on the action you want to choose.
    In iOS 11, it became possible for developers to add custom rotor options that work within their apps. These could be used to speak information or make options more practical to use. For instance, in the BlindSquare GPS navigation app, you might find yourself missing a spoken message because you needed to pay attention to your surroundings. Being able to go over the last few spoken messages quickly could prove handy in keeping your bearings while travelling. Therefore, the developers of BlindSquare have added the Speech History rotor setting. Turning to this setting, you simply have to flick upward to hear prior spoken messages. If developers take the time to include such features, you will be able to find out about them in the help or other documentation provided for that specific app. As this capability was only recently introduced, awareness of it is still spreading among app developers. I look forward to experiencing the many ingenious uses developers come up with in the years ahead as more of them learn about the possibility of adding custom rotor options to their apps. There's a great deal of untapped potential in this capability.
Changing What's on the Rotor:
A lot of people greatly enjoy the rotor idea. I'm one of them, and my rotor has nearly every possible option on it. However, having too much on the rotor can be overwhelming for beginners. Thankfully, it is possible to change which tools are present in the rotor and decide the order that they're positioned. This lets you find an order and set of features that best suits your style, needs, and competence.
    To customize the rotor, go into VoiceOver settings and then flick right until you come to Rotor. Double tap that button, and you'll be in the right place. Apple has consolidated these settings considerably in iOS 18. The "rotor items" button is what you want to double tap on in order to arrange and choose rotor options. Once there, You'll find a long list of settings with buttons that can be either selected or not. Selected items will appear on the rotor. All others won't ever appear. To add or remove items from the rotor, you simply double tap a setting to select or deselect it.
    That lets you easily remove unwanted items from the rotor, reducing clutter. However, that still may mean many options to turn through to reach the one you want at a given moment. It certainly does in my case. Thankfully, it is possible to change the order of options on the rotor. One flick to the right of each setting is a Reorder button. To use these buttons, find the one to the right of the option you want to move. Next, double tap and hold your finger on the screen after the second tap. You can then drag the button up or down to change the placement of the item on the rotor. As you drag your finger, you will be told what it moves above or below. There will also be a small auditory beep and tactile vibration. You will be told what you've moved above or below. Just take your time and move your finger slowly while you get the hang of this. Alternatively, you can flick up or down, and you'll come to options called "move up" and "mov down". Double tap this to cause the rotor item to move up or down in the list.
    To the right of the "rotor items" button is a switch called "change rotor with items". This lets you choose whether the rotor turns automatically to the most likely appropriate setting as you go over different elements on the screen. For instance, if you flick onto a file or slider control, the rotor will turn to the "actions" or "adjust value" setting respectively. Turning this off may be desirable if you don't want such automatic adjustments made and would rather turn the rotor manually.
    The next setting lets you decide whether you can edit apps on the home screen using the rotor. Turning this off will mean that you would have to double tap and hold or perform a one finger triple tap on an app and then select the "edit home screen" option to enter editing mode. If the switch is on, you can simply flick down after touching any app and then double tap to enter edit mode.
    The "direct touch apps" button lets you select apps which must be interacted with using a special mode called direct touch. The rotor cannot be used while in this mode. Other gestures might be required, but VoiceOver will still speak and output Braille. Such apps are becoming more numerous due to the arrival of an accessibility plugin for the Unity app development platform.
How to Do It: Selecting Braille Screen Input
Braille Screen Input, or BSI for short, lets you position your fingers on the screen as if they were on the keys of a Braille writer and enter Braille characters. This can be easier to master for people proficient in Braille than the standard onscreen keyboard. What's more, if this option is moved to the very top of the rotor, you will find that BSI will activate automatically whenever an edit field is entered. This can save you many twists of the rotor if you want to use it whenever possible. To demonstrate how to select and change the order of items in the rotor, we will go through the steps of setting this up. If you don't want to actually use BSI, simply double tap the Braille Screen Input option until it doesn't say "selected". Presuming you're already in the Rotor settings:
1. Flick to the right repeatedly until you come to Braille Screen Input.
2. Double tap on this button to enable this feature.
3. Flick once to the right, placing you on the Reorder button matching the Braille Screen Input feature.
4. Double tap quickly with one finger lower down on the screen. After the second tap, hold your finger down. Think of this like picking up a puzzle piece. As long as your finger remains on the screen, the choice will be attached to it as if your fingertip were magnetic.
5. Slowly slide your finger up towards the top of the screen. You will hear a small click sound and feel a short vibration each time you move your finger far enough to pass an option. You will also be told what you move above as your finger slides up the screen.
6. If you get to the top of the screen, lift your finger. You can then find the Reorder button for the Braille Screen Input option again and move it further up if necessary.
7. Make certain that the Braille Screen Input option is at the very top of the list of rotor settings. There's a heading at the very top of the list, so turning the rotor to Headings and flicking up will get you to the top quickly.
8. Flick right over the options. The very first one should now be Braille Screen Input. This completes the process. From now on, the Braille keyboard will activate whenever you need to type something. If you prefer not to make use of the Braille keyboard during a particular occasion, you need only turn the rotor to another option, such as Characters or Words. The traditional keyboard will then be available.
Now, you should be able to move options around at will, as well as determine which of them will be on your rotor.
Quick Settings:
In iOS 15, Apple introduced an addition called quick settings which, I believe, will be helpful to all but especially to beginners who have yet to master the rotor. Think of it as a handy pocket where you can have settings for VoiceOver available anywhere you happen to be. This removes the need to lose your place in an app or home screen and go into VoiceOver settings in order to introduce changes to frequently altered settings.
    Selecting and arranging the settings you want to have in that handy pocket is done in the same way as for rotor settings. Simply go into VoiceOver settings, and then into "Quick settings". Once there, you can double tap settings to include or exclude them from the settings found in the quick settings pocket. Any settings which say "selected" before their names will appear. Any that don't won't trouble you while in the quick settings pocket. There is no limit on how many settings can be in the pocket.
    Similar to rotor options, the order of settings can be rearranged. When on a setting, flick up or down with the rotor, and you'll come to options to move the setting you're on up or down towards the start or the end of the collection. It's that simple.
    None of the navigation settings are available in the quick settings choices. You can't use it to change the rotor to characters or words. However, things like language, speaking rate, punctuation, typing feedback and typing mode are available. Beginners may find it useful to have those kinds of settings available in the quick settings and remove them from the rotor. This would make it less likely that you would accidentally turn off hints or accidentally reduce speaking rate or volume. The rotor would be less cluttered with choices unless and until you reached a point where you wanted to have them on the rotor again. Absolutely nothing stops you from having settings available both on the rotor and in quick settings at the same time. The only consideration is how many turns or flicks you want to execute to reach the setting you want in each collection.
    Once you've added settings to the quick settings pocket, you get to it by a two finger quadruple tap. Using two fingers at the same time, strike the touchscreen four times in quick succession. You will then find yourself in an area containing the settings you selected. There's a search field and a filter to restrict the selection even further. Otherwise, simply use a finger to flick right through the settings or left to go back over them towards the top. The settings are fully active, so you can flick up or down on them to make adjustments as if you had selected them in the rotor.
Voices of Choice:
Now that we've gotten you to this point, it's time to let you in on something. You're not stuck with the default voice that VoiceOver has used to speak to you with. Apple makes a growing collection of voices available, and you don't need to pay for them. However, they do take up data storage space on your iOS device. Make certain you're connected to Wi-Fi before downloading these voices. On average, higher quality voices tend to be well over fifty megabytes and can even approach a gigabyte in size. Some of the better voices are more than half a gigabyte. Alex, a high-quality voice made by Apple, is the largest voice available so far. It takes up over 800 MB. However, Alex is unique in that he simulates breathing as he reads. Many people, myself included, think he's well worth his bulk. Others, including my wife Sara, think Alex is a bit creepy and prefer other voices. Thankfully, there are at least a couple of choices for each supported language. At a bare minimum, there will be a male and female voice. For many languages, there are more voices available.
    Things have changed when it comes to selecting and switching between voices in iOS 18. There are no longer any restrictions regarding how many voices you can have in slots on the rotor in each language. The rotor, which used to be called the "language" rotor, has now changed to being the "voices" rotor. You can have as many voices on it as you wish, and they can be from any supported language.
    To download voices and add languages to your rotor, go into VoiceOver settings and then into Speech. Once there, flick right, and you'll hear what the default voice is. You will also find numerous settings, including Rate and Volume, that you can adjust. Notice that the voice name is a button. Double tap that button, and you can change to a different default voice. The change would only take effect after the chosen voice finishes downloading. That's also the case if you change the active voice for a voice rotor slot.
    Before iOs 18, you would need to add languages to the language rotor and then pick a voice to represent that language. Different dialects counted as different languages. For example, you could add Australian, British, and Irish English languages to the rotor and then pick an appropriate voice for each language slot. Now, things have changed. The rotor is called the "Voices" rotor, and you can put any voice you wish into a slot. After you flick past the default voice, you'll find these additional voices listed and a button to add more rotor voices. This is more streamlined than it used to be, and you are able to have more than one voice in the same language to switch between on the fly.
How to Do It: Adding a New Voice:
Presuming you're in the VoiceOver Speech Settings:
1. Flick right until you reach the Add rotor voice button.
2. Double tap this button with one finger. This takes you to a list of languages.
3. Flick right through the languages until you hear one that you're familiar with and want to try. Double tap this and VoiceOver will take you in to a collection of voices available for the language chosen. Note that a language may have one or more dialects. These variations divide the list of voices into sections with their own headings. For instance, there are headings for English US and english UK. Beneath the headings, you'll find any available choices. Some of these choices make use of different text to speech engines. They include Siri, Eloquence and others. Double tap on the name of the speech engine to expand its collection of voices or to collapse those options so you can pass by engines you don't prefer. You can hear a sample of their speech by flicking down and double tapping on the "speak sample" option. Double tap on a voice which interests you in order to download the voice and add it to the rotor.
4. To try this new voice, turn the rotor to the Voices setting.
5. Flick up or down with one finger through the available options. There will be at least two, including the default or primary voice, plus the voice you've added. Continuing to flick in either direction will rap through any available options endlessly. You simply need to turn the rotor to something else after you are happy with the voice selected.
Once voices have been added to the Voices rotor, they will take up slots and can be cycled through. Also, they will be designated in the Speech settings area as being "used". You can have more voices on your iPhone than you have slots on the rotor. It is even possible to have more than one instance of the same voice. Double tapping on an active voice will bring you into its options. These will be different depending on the kind of speech engine used. For instance, Siri voices have different styles including default, narration, fast, and flat inflection. Other voices have options to control pitch variation range, tambour, the length of pauses between sentences, etc. Every voice as an equalizer which lets you adjust the bass and treble aspects of a voice. In all cases, there's a button to reset a voice to factory default settings.
    Should space become tight, it is possible to delete extra voices. You simply go into the VoiceOver Speech settings and flick right over the active voices. To delete a voice, flick down while on a voice's name. You will eventually reach the Delete option and can then double tap with one finger to remove the voice from your device.
    Whenever a new version of iOS comes out, it's a good idea to check in the Speech area for possible new voices in your language or dialect of choice. In iOS 18, there are new Australian Siri voices. Also, the English US voices are special since they use AI to generate them on the fly. As a result, they're substantially smaller than other voices of similar quality.
Selecting Text:
Thanks to the rotor, selecting, copying, cutting and pasting text are all done easily. To use your rotor for this purpose, the Text Selection setting must be available on your rotor. It may not be there by default, so you may have to add it. We'll go over adding, ordering, and removing items from your rotor later. Once you turn to the Text Selection setting, flicking up or down adjusts the unit of movement that the cursor will travel and select. To select text, flick right to expand the selected content by one unit of movement. Flick left to shrink the selected area by a unit of movement. You can change the unit of movement to fine-tune what is selected. For instance, you could select a few lines of text and then flick up to set the movement unit to Words so that you can then flick left to remove one or more words you didn't want selected.
    Let's use a sentence as an example. "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog." To remove "The quick brown fox", follow these steps:
1. Turn the rotor to Characters or Words, and move to the start of the word "The".
2. Next, turn the rotor to Text Selection.
3. Flick up or down to cycle through the units of movement until you come to Words.
4. Flick right a few times, and you will hear "The quick brown fox" marked as selected.
5. Find the Delete key near the bottom right of the virtual keyboard, or hit the Delete key on your physical keyboard if you're using one. This will delete the selected text.
Sticking with our example sentence, let's tackle cutting and pasting text. We'll pivot the two ends of the sentence around "jumped over". When we're done, "the lazy dog" will jump over "the quick brown fox". Follow these steps:
1. Select "The quick brown fox" precisely as we did above.
2. Next, turn the rotor to the Edit setting. This provides you with access to a menu of common editing actions.
3. Flick up or down until you come to Cut, and double tap with one finger to perform the action. "The quick brown fox" is now removed from its customary home at the start of the sentence and is in your clipboard. This is a temporary storage place where things are put until they are copied or pasted elsewhere.
4. Turn the rotor to Characters or Words, and flick down to get past "jumped over". Hit the space key to leave a space after "over".
5. Turn the rotor until you reach Edit, and then flick down until you get to paste. Double tap with one finger to Paste "The quick brown fox" after "jumped over".
6. Next, turn the rotor to Characters or Words, and flick down over that "quick brown fox". Get to the start of "the lazy dog".
7. Turn the rotor to Text Selection and set the movement unit to Word Selection. Flick right three times to select "the lazy dog".
8. Turn the rotor to edit and flick up or down until you reach Cut. Double tap this with one finger and "the lazy dog" will be hoisted into your clipboard.
9. Turn the rotor to Characters or Words and move to before the words "jumped over". Put a space before the "j" in "jumped" and flick up to move to before that space. This way, our last step will place "the lazy dog" perfectly in his new home at the start of the sentence.
10. Turn the rotor to edit and flick up or down to find paste. Double tap this, and you're all done. The spacing may not be perfect, but we've achieved our aim.
This works on whole blocks of text, allowing you to easily reorder chunks of the document you're working on. It lets you quickly select precisely the text you want to share from an email. You could then use the text edit setting to copy that text to the clipboard, go to the email you're composing, and paste the text from the other one right into it. Follow the same method for web pages and anywhere else you're allowed to copy or edit text. You can't use it to copy a commercial ebook and paste the entire thing into a document, thereby defeating digital copy protection.
    Written out as a list of steps, the text selection process sounds far less intuitive and natural than it will actually feel after you've used text selection a few times. It's all turns and flicks. Part of my sense of how easy text selection and movement actually is now comes from my having to live through how nearly impossible the process was prior to Apple devising this system. For me, it has literally made all the difference. I began my iPhone journey, refusing to write anything on my iPhone longer than a few paragraphs. After text selection and manipulation became easy, thanks to the rotor, I wanted to use my iPhone for absolutely all of my writing. Once I found a good Bluetooth keyboard and the nifty word processor I'm now using, this became not only possible, but truly enjoyable. As long as you understand what the gestures do, you'll marvel at how intuitive, precise, and quick the text selection process is.
VoiceOver Settings:
Having control over your screen reader and understanding all related options is of paramount importance. To aid this process, we will discuss most of the VoiceOver settings here rather than in the larger section devoted to what's in the Settings app. The only big exception to this is the settings related to Braille. These are discussed in the section called Braille on iOS Devices, which you will find later in the book. You can always refer to this section if you need to understand something about VoiceOver. The first thing you come to in these settings is an item that announces that VoiceOver is on. This is a toggle. If you double tap it, you will shut VoiceOver off. Should you do this accidentally, don't panic. Simply hold in the Home button until a beep is heard and say "turn on VoiceOver". This will cause Siri to turn on VoiceOver. Presuming you have set up the Accessibility Shortcut, you can also simply press the Home button or power button three times rapidly if your device has no Home button. VoiceOver should turn on and announce this to you.
    Flicking right from this toggle, you will find some text giving very brief instructions for how to use VoiceOver. To the right of these lines of text, you will come to a button called practice. This will take you to an area where you can practice different gestures. You can also get to this practice area from anywhere using a four-finger double tap. You'll also find a "what's new in VoiceOver" option and a Tutorial. Past those options, you'll find numerous settings.
Speaking Rate
Continuing to flick right from the Practice button, you will hear the first setting, which is Speaking Rate. This is actually a heading. Once you have mastered the rotor, turn it to Headings and flick up or down to quickly reach this heading. In this instance, it is the only heading on the screen. While in a web browser, it is a fast way to navigate websites and other documents. In this settings screen, it is handy to quickly reach the first setting past the on/off toggle and introductory text, or to move upward from deep into the settings.
    Flicking right once more, you will come to a slider. You can adjust this by flicking up or down to increase or decrease the speaking rate of VoiceOver.
Speech:
This group of settings lets you take control of which voice is used by VoiceOver, as well as other aspects of how it speaks. You can have Many voices available on your device and add them to the Voices rotor. You can then quickly switch between these differently accented voices without having to return to this section of Settings. To change the voice occupying a Voices rotor slot, you will need to use this section. Voices take up space on your device, so you can remove ones you don't want.
    It is also possible to customize how these voices sound. Connected to each specific voice are "per voice settings". These settings are attached to each voice developed by a third-party developer. Using them, you can change certain characteristics of the voices. The options available will differ depending on which company has developed the voices.
    To find these settings, go into settings, accessibility, VoiceOver, speech. Next, double tap the "voice" button if you want to change the default voice. Alternatively, go down to the button of any voice you've added to the Voices rotor. Double tap on that button and flick right through the voice choices available. Some voices are in their own separate expandable subsections of the list like Siri voices. Eloquence voices are another example of this. Go into a subsection by double tapping on its name. Next, flick right through the specific voice choices available. Let's use Tom as an example. Double tap on Tom and you can choose whether to use the compact or enhanced Tom voice. Some voices also have a premium option which is even higher quality. Double tap on the voice to select it. You may have to double tap to download the voice first. When you're on the voice you want, flick down and you'll find some options. Flick down to the "per voice settings" option and double tap on that. You might land on the preview settings option. If that happens, do a four finger tap at the top of the screen to get to the start of the options. For Tom, you'll find options to change the tambour of the voice. You can also increase or decrease the pause between sentences. Other voices will have even more options. For Eloquence voices, you'll find options to change pitch variation, head size, roughness, breathiness, and more.
    Besides choosing which voices are available on your device and in your Voices rotor, you can also change how certain words are pronounced. You do this through the Pronunciations button located in the Speech section. Once in the Pronunciations control, you'll find a list, presuming you've added entries before. Alternatively, you will simply find an Add button that brings you to where you can enter words or phrases and how you want them pronounced. These entries can be case-sensitive or not as desired. They can also be only specific to a single app like a word processor, or voice-specific if desired. There's a lot of room for flexibility here. Having grown up with synthetic speech, I don't make use of this feature. However, those who have trouble understanding their voice of choice may find it very useful. This is especially true if you want names pronounced correctly. For the most part, I think VoiceOver does a good job, far exceeding what I remember from school days.
Braille:
These particular settings are discussed in the separate section in this guide detailing Braille support. There are quite a lot of them. Braille support is very extensive and allows any app useable with VoiceOver to be used in Braille via a Bluetooth connected Braille display. 
VoiceOver Recognition Settings:
These settings let you take some control over which recognition capabilities you want to enable or disable in normal circumstances. You can also customize what these features announce or reveal through sound output. Image descriptions, text recognition and screen recognition all have the capability to be toggled on or off at a minimum. They also have other settings, such as the ability not to describe inappropriate images out loud automatically.
    Of these settings, the screen recognition is the most likely to cause issues if it isn't used carefully. Basically, it attempts to aid in using apps whose controls are improperly labelled through the use of artificial intelligence. The problem is that this process can render some apps with excellent accessibility impossible to use when it's turned on in that app. Thankfully, it's possible to select which apps make use of screen recognition and which don't while the feature is turned on. I recommend that people have this feature turned on, as it can save your day every once in a while. However, turn it off for apps where it seems like things are less accessible than they should be. If an app's description says that it works well with VoiceOver, chances are good that screen recognition won't play nicely with a developer's extensive efforts to make their app accessible. Turning the feature off for that app will let those efforts come to the foreground.
Verbosity:
The next setting is actually a button that opens a small subcategory of settings that control how verbose VoiceOver is. This functions exactly like the button in Accessibility settings that takes you to the VoiceOver settings we are now investigating. Think of it like a big tree with branches. The Verbosity settings are a branch extending from VoiceOver settings. Within this branch, you'll find a whole range of options to control what VoiceOver informs you of. Everything from hints to punctuation to notifications. You can choose whether you want to hear descriptions of emoji when you encounter them. You can choose whether you want predictive text suggestions to be spoken. There's a lot of flexibility here.
    System Notifications:
    In this area of verbosity settings, you'll find choices for when the iPhone is locked as well as for when banners appear while your iPhone is unlocked. In each circumstance, VoiceOver can alert you in several ways. It can speak the notification. On the lockscreen, you can have it speak the count or number of notifications which the app has generated. You can also choose whether to send notifications to your Braille display. For banners, you can choose to have them spoken, alert you with haptic vibrations, and be sent to your Braille display. Double tap on these choices to select and deselect them. You can have more than one alert method selected if you wish. For instance, you can have speak and Braille selected so that you'll be alerted whether you're using a Braille display. Alternatively, you can choose the "do nothing" option so you won't be interrupted by any notifications at all. Unfortunately, for banners and lock screen notifications, the "speak" option wasn't selected by default. This left people wondering why they weren't hearing their notifications. Compounding the problem, alert sounds used to inform people of notifications and other events were initially harder to hear in iOS17. Predictive Feedback:
    Predictive text feedback settings are in the verbosity VoiceOver settings. In there, you can decide what VoiceOver does when predictive text appears. It can be spoken aloud normally. A sound can play to indicate predictive text is available. The predictive text can be spoken in a different pitch. Alternatively, people can choose to have no special feedback. The same choices are available for feedback when predictive text is entered. In this way, you can have an easier time telling what's happening and make more effective use of predictive text.
    There are many toggle settings in the Verbosity area. These include a toggle for hints. While you're still learning the ropes, you'll want these to be enabled or on. There is also a toggle having to do with emojis. VoiceOver can speak the word "emoji" to make certain you know that you have encountered these pictures meant to convey emotional content. If this setting is disabled, you would merely hear the image description of the emoji. You'll also find a setting indicating whether you want any detected text to be spoken. This can be handy if an item in focus isn't properly labelled. There might be text on pictures that would also be spoken if this feature is enabled. You can also control the amount of punctuation spoken. Finally, you can determine how you want to handle any tables you might encounter. For now, that's all you'll find in this branch of VoiceOver settings. I wouldn't be surprised if more settings are eventually encapsulated in here, though. To back out of an area or branch of a tree of options, like this Verbosity branch, touch the top-left area of the screen to find the Back button. Double tap this with one finger, and you'll move back one level. You'll be doing this often and will soon find your finger remembers precisely where to touch so as to hit the Back button and not the status bar immediately above it.
Audio:
This small but important subsection of VoiceOver settings lets you control any sound-related aspects of VoiceOver's operation. Besides speech, VoiceOver contains haptic and sound cues to help blind people follow what's happening. You can turn these on and off here. One example of such a cue is a small sound and vibration which happens when VoiceOver moves to a new line. Also, you can determine whether you want VoiceOver to speak through the left, right, or both channels. You can also do the same for sound effects so that it's possible to have speech in one ear and sounds in the other if you wish. Another significant setting in this cluster is Audio Ducking. When enabled, any other audio such as music that is playing will have its volume lowered whenever VoiceOver is speaking. This way, you can be certain to hear everything said by VoiceOver. You can also adjust whether ducking is constantly applied or only happens when VoiceOver speaks. In IOS 18, the ability to adjust the ducking amount has been added. This is very helpful when you want to listen to music or background sound while still needing to hear VoiceOver clearly. Another potentially useful setting found here lets you automatically switch calls to speakerphone if you aren't holding your iPhone up to your ear.
    A new addition as of iOS 13 is the tactile bumps felt as you use VoiceOver. This is called haptic feedback, and you'll find a Sounds & Haptics setting in the Audio branch of VoiceOver settings. You can choose which elements create bumps when interacted with, turning them on or off as desired. Also, you can select the strength of the bumps that you feel. Of course, it's also possible to completely turn off this haptic feedback if you dislike it.
Commands:
One of the most extensive and liberating additions for VoiceOver users in iOS 13 is the ability to fully customize the gestures and keystrokes that VoiceOver makes use of. This level of control was previously only available to users of Braille displays. However, it is now possible to assign and change any of the default gestures or keyboard commands Apple has chosen into ones that better suit your ability and style of use. I won't go over each an every option here. Doing that could easily add fifty thousand words to this already large document, and there's really no need. An overview of this branch of settings and a few examples should give you enough to make your own changes.
    This branch is divided into several sections. Each section has a button that brings you to it. The All Commands button lets you access the entire list. This list is also divided into areas of interest, each having its own button. Next, there are buttons to access all Touch Gestures and all Keyboard Shortcuts. This division is very useful for modifying the interface you're using. However, I typically prefer going into the All Commands list.
    Past these buttons, you'll also find buttons dealing with changing gestures used while using Braille Screen Input or while using Handwriting. Each of these special modes of input requires its own small set of gestures. These are treated differently while in these input modes.
    Many available commands don't come with keyboard shortcuts assigned to them. In such circumstances, people will need to add their own. A particularly useful example of this is the command to navigate to the item at the centre of the screen.
    Go to the commands setting in VoiceOver settings. Double tap on the all commands button. Next, flick right an double tap on basic navigation. Flick right until you get to "move to item at centre". Double tap on this. You can assign a keyboard command to activate this command and get you easily to the centre of the screen. This is useful in apps with documents or screens with logs of information where you would otherwise have a hard time scrolling back to the place you left off. For instance, you might be in the middle of a document and have to leave the app and come back to it. Before now, there was no easy way to get to the centre of the screen without needing to touch it. In order to do something like enter a document you want to edit, you'll have to follow up the navigation command with the one to activate or simulate a double tap. By default, that's assigned to the VO plus space bar keyboard shortcut.
    At the end of the Commands branch, you'll find something vital. It's the button that lets you reset to the original set of commands. I'm ever so thankful this has been added, as it's easy to customize everything so much that other users won't have a clue how to help you. Unfortunately, there's currently no ability to save a configuration of customized commands. Should you need to use that reset option, all the changes and customizations you've made will be lost.
    While in one of these lists, you can edit the list, changing the order of entries and even removing unwanted commands if desired. If you want to change an entry, double tap on it. You are then presented with a large list of options for the gesture or keyboard shortcut. The options are organized into sections under headings. This will let you quickly navigate to what you want a shortcut or gesture to do.
Changing the Rotor into Easy Swipes
Many people really struggle with the concept of turning the rotor. One way to make it easier is to change the feel of it entirely. Instead of a dial that turns and points at options, we can make it a menu that is swiped through with two fingers. Swiping left will get us to the previous rotor option, and swiping right will get us to the next rotor option. It becomes a series of pulldown menus we can swipe through. Frankly, I think Apple may have been better off using these two finger left and right swipes we are about to set up. This does conflict with gestures used in Braille screen input. It also conflicts with the new default assignments of these gestures to group navigation. You'll need to find other gestures and make appropriate adjustments should you decide to follow these instructions. Let's get started.
    To achieve this, we first need to find a suitable simple pair of complementary gestures that aren't already used. To accomplish that, double tap on the Touch Gestures button. This presents you with a list of gestures starting with the single-finger tap and going all the way up through four-finger taps and swipes. You can flick right quickly through all the taps and reach the Two-Finger Swipe Left gesture. Double tap on this, and you'll find a large list divided into headings. Turn the rotor to Headings, and flick down until you come to the Rotor heading. There, you'll find buttons for Previous and Next Rotor. Double tap on the Previous Rotor button. You'll be returned to the list of gestures. Flick left or right to find the Two-Finger Swipe Right gesture. Double tap on this, and then use the same method you did for finding the Previous Rotor command, but select the Next Rotor option instead. Double tap this, and you've done it.
    Now, you can swipe with two fingers left or right to cycle through the rotor options. As before, you still flick up or down with one finger to change a rotor option you are currently on or move by that increment through a website, document, or other text. This should feel a lot less strange for people who can't cope with turning an imaginary knob.
    Sometimes, changes like this may conflict with other gestures. If you decide to use these two-finger swipes for your rotor, it will conflict with gestures used for Braille Screen Input. If you don't plan to use this method of input, there's no worry. However, if you do plan to use Braille Screen Input or Handwriting, you may want to stick with the original rotor turns or find alternative gestures.
How to Easily Reach the Status Bar:
Here's the problem. On devices without home buttons, the very top and bottom areas of the touchscreen are used to indicate you wish to reach special areas such as the home screens or app switcher, etc. It has therefore become much harder to find and use the status bar and avoid triggering the special condition that looks for those upward or downward slides. Sometimes, you just want to know how much battery charge your device has, whether you have cellular signal, or what the time is. I'm hopeful that over time, Apple will ease this difficulty. However, it's now easy for those of us who make use of the status bar to take proactive action.
    What we need is a simple gesture that isn't already assigned to another function that will move us onto the status bar. Once there, it's still quite possible to flick left and right to go over the current contents. In the Commands branch of VoiceOver settings, find and double tap the Touch Gestures button. Next, set your rotor to Headings and flick down through the various gestures until you find one that doesn't have an assigned function. I settled on the Four-Finger Single Tap. The Four-Finger Double Tap is already used to invoke the VoiceOver Help mode, which lets you practice and find out what gestures do. Using the Four-Finger Single Tap to reach the status bar seems like an easy gesture to remember and isn't already being used. On my iPhone XR, there's enough room to make invoking this gesture easy. On more narrow, smaller devices, another gesture might prove more suitable.
    Once I've found the Four-Finger swipe up, I double tap on that heading. This takes me into a large list of functions that I can assign to this gesture. Set your rotor to Headings for speedy navigation between kinds of functions. I flicked down to the Basic Navigation heading, and then flicked right through the list of functions in that category. Eventually, I came to Move to Status Bar. I merely had to double tap on this to assign the function. To make any newly assigned commands active it is necessary to restart VoiceOver. I used the accessibility shortcut discussed earlier in this section to turn VoiceOver off and then again to turn it back on. Now, whenever I use a four-finger swipe up, I'm immediately transported to the status bar. This may not work in all circumstances. I've found that in Ulysses, my writing app of choice, I don't end up reaching the status bar and still need to find it by feel. However, the newly assigned gesture will work as expected in most circumstances.
Further Thoughts on Commands:
These are two very basic examples. There are endless possibilities for useful customization here. Perhaps, you're used to a set of keyboard commands from a different screen reader and would like the keyboard commands for VoiceOver to be more like those commands. Perhaps, you find one or more of the gestures assigned by Apple to be less than ideal for your particular dexterity or hand coordination. Turning the rotor is a prime example of this. Now, you can sculpt the set of gestures or keyboard commands to be truly optimal for you. I hope the simple examples I've outlined above will be sufficient to drive you to explore this branch of VoiceOver settings and use what it offers. If worse comes to worst, remember that there's always that Command reset button.
    As you create or alter commands, keep symmetry in mind. In the example for previous and next rotor gestures, we used two-finger left and right swipes. Nothing prevents us from using a swipe to go one way and a tap to go another. However, doing this sort of thing can make it more likely that you'll forget commands. The choices Apple makes in the default set of commands have been carefully thought through to be logical, symmetrical, and consistent.
    Don't worry about accidentally overriding the function of a gesture or keyboard shortcut. If you pick a gesture or shortcut that is already being used, a dialogue will pop up to warn you. At that point, you can either cancel the change or reassign the gesture or keyboard command to your newly chosen purpose. Absolutely nothing is written in stone.
Activities
In addition to the ability to customize gestures and keyboard commands discussed above, Apple has also added the ability to customize how VoiceOver behaves based on the app you're in or the kind of thing you're trying to do. These two capabilities transform VoiceOver from a "my way or the highway" screen reader into an experience that is as flexible as other screen readers have been since the beginning. Perhaps, you want a slower voice that doesn't speak out punctuation marks for use while reading a Kindle book. On the other hand, you want a faster voice that reads most or all punctuation marks when you're writing or proofreading a document. Until iOS 13, you would have had to adjust everything manually each time you wanted to make a change. Activities settings can now perform these changes automatically or at your command through the ability to select Activities using the rotor.
    The area where you manage and create Activities is just past the Commands setting. Double tap on Activities, and you'll be there. The first thing you'll find is an Edit button. This lets you rearrange and remove Activities you've created. After that, you'll find the programming example Activity Apple has created. This will give you an idea of what ingredients go into an Activity. Past that, you'll find a very brief text explaining what Activities are. Last of all, there's the Add Activity button. As you create Activities, they'll be added to the list after the Edit button. You will also be able to select them using the Activities setting on the rotor.
    When you double tap on the Add Activity button, you are presented with an Activity Creation dialogue. The first thing on it is a text field for you to choose a name for that Activity. It would be a good idea to name activities based on the specific app or situation you want them to be triggered with. I write a lot, so we'll create a group of settings ideal for my writing habits. I'll name the Activity "Writing". The first thing I come to is a heading called Speech Settings. I could select a different voice, but will leave it on the default setting. The speaking rate defaults to 50%, which is too slow for when I'm writing. I'll set that to 65%. This takes some fiddling, since the slider moves by 10% increments. Dragging and sliding your finger can help with this, as can double tapping on the slider, which changes its value by 2% at a time. The volume is fine where it is.
    Verbosity settings come next. I like my Punctuation setting to "some" while writing. I don't use emojis, so that's set to "off". The same goes for table information. Using a physical keyboard, I need not worry about Braille Settings. Flicking down to the next heading, I find Automatic Switching, which will cause the activity to activate when the correct app or situation is encountered. This is a context-specific activity I want to create, so I'll double tap on Context. The very first Context option is Word Processing. I double tap on this, which selects it. I then need to use the Back button to leave the list of contexts and return to the Activity Creation dialogue.
    The final part of the dialogue lets you select different modifier keys for indicating VoiceOver control rather than the default ones. I never use the caps lock while writing, so I choose not to change that. Having gone through the full dialogue, I touch the top left of the touchscreen to find the Back button. There is no Save button. I am returned to the main ACTIVITIES dialogue and find that both the Programming and Writing activities are now present.
    There are around seven or eight different contexts such as Narrative or Spreadsheet, etc. that can be chosen from. Presumably, any app you have installed can be added to the Automatic Switching list to trigger the Activity setting to come into effect. A simple yet powerful tool for customizing how VoiceOver works in different situations. I wouldn't be surprised if the number of options and behaviour possibilities increases in the Activities setting over time.
Navigation Style:
This lets you select between group or flat navigation. The flat method is what VoiceOver users are already familiar with. Elements are moved to from left to right, top to bottom. Group navigation offers a way to move between, into or out of groups of related items. The Weather app offers a good example of how useful this might be. Using group navigation, I can easily flick right over a list of groups and quickly reach the "rainfall" group. I then swipe right with two fingers to enter the "rainfall" group. Flicking right with one finger will then give me the information about any expected rainfall. I can then swipe left with two fingers to return to the list of groups. Using the classic flat navigation would involve a lot of scrolling and guesswork to reach the information I wanted. Grouped navigation can come in very handy at times. You can add the navigation style option to the quick settings or the rotor so you can turn it on or off as desired.
Rotor Settings
These settings allow you to customize the order and contents of the VoiceOver rotor. Simply double tap on features to add or remove them. To rearrange them, tap and hold your finger down on the Reorder button next to the feature you want to move. Keeping your finger on the screen, slide it up or down. You'll hear a brief beep, and VoiceOver will tell you that you've moved the feature above or below others as you pass over them. That's all there is to this section, but it's enough to really make a big difference with your experience of the rotor.
Typing
The settings in this section let you adjust how VoiceOver interacts with the typing experience. There are a few different aspects to this that we'll examine below:
    Typing Style
    There are three typing styles or modes to choose from. The Default is called Standard Typing. In this mode, you can feel around and find the key you want to type in. Once you've found it, tap twice quickly on that spot. Alternatively, you can hold your finger on that key while tapping anywhere else on the screen with another finger. This is called a split tap. I personally find this method to be slow and cumbersome. However, it makes as certain as possible that what gets entered is what you intend. This is especially safe and useful for beginners or people with hand mobility challenges. Don't worry about how long you hold down your finger on the key after you find it. You have all the time in the world.
    The next mode is called Touch Typing. In this mode, you can feel around to find the right key, and then simply lift your finger off the screen to enter the keystroke. I prefer this method as it accelerates the typing process. Don't take too long raising your finger, though. Otherwise, you will find yourself entering an alternate symbol. These are less commonly used, but handy every once in a while. I find the time before alternates appear to be long enough, but beginners might feel a little rushed. Experiment with this typing mode in the Notes app, where it's impossible to do anything too unexpected.
    The last typing mode is called Direct Touch Typing. It basically lets you type unaffected by VoiceOver. Keystrokes are entered the instant a key is touched, so you had better know exactly where you put your finger. This mode is for those who are blessed with good hand coordination and muscle memory.
Phonetic Feedback:
This lets you hear phonetic words used to represent entered characters, like you hear over radio transmissions. For instance, "Alpha" for "A", "Bravo" for "B", "Charlie" for "C", etc. You can choose to hear only the phonetic words or have the normal characters spoken followed immediately by the phonetic word. This might be useful in noisy environments when it would be easy to miss hearing just the typed character spoken. Choices here are Off, Character and Phonetics, or Phonetics Only.
Typing Feedback:
This setting lets you pick what kind of feedback you want while typing. You can choose between Nothing, Characters, Words, or both Characters and Words. This last mode means you'll hear each typed character spoken as well as the whole word when a space, return, or punctuation mark is inserted. These choices are the same for all software keyboards found on the screen of your device, with a separate set of these choices for physical hardware keyboards. Currently, I'm typing this on a mechanical keyboard I recently acquired for use while at home. It provides excellent tactile feedback. As I've come to trust that keystrokes are being properly registered, I've switched to no typing feedback while I'm using it. Meanwhile, for typing on my iPhone's screen, I prefer to hear characters I type spoken so that I know they're correct before proceeding to the next character.
Modifier Keys:
This setting lets you choose which keys are used to indicate that you want to control VoiceOver rather than type something while using a physical keyboard. The Caps Lock key is my preferred modifier key. You can also use the Control and Option keys held down together. Nothing stops you from having both options selected.
Keyboard Interaction Time:
This determines how long after you may continue to hold down a key before VoiceOver determines that you wish to access the Slide to Type feature or alternative options. The default delay is one second. Beginners who don't often make use of alternative options may wish to increase this to two or more seconds so that they aren't rushed while learning how to proficiently type on the touchscreen.
Always Speak Notifications
This setting tells VoiceOver whether you always want to hear new Notifications when they appear. This is the default behaviour. If you would rather not be informed, you can set this to off, and check the Notification Centre for any updates when it's convenient for you. This might be preferred when reading a book or working, for instance. You can have Notifications generate sounds that are unique to a given app. This can be a good compromise as you'll know from the sound that an update is available from a specific app without your workflow or reading being interrupted.
Navigate Images:
This setting lets VoiceOver move between images on a website. You can set it to only move to images with descriptive alt text and ignore ones without this information. Alternatively, you can have VoiceOver register all images regardless of whether they're described. Finally, you could elect to have VoiceOver ignore all imagery in websites, skipping over them silently. Depending on what you're doing, all of these modes can be useful options to have.
Delay Before Selection:
This setting lets you increase the time which you much touch the screen for until VoiceOver changes its focus to where you touch. If you find that VoiceOver jumps too quickly when you don't intend for its focus to move, try increasing this setting. The default is zero, which means VoiceOver reacts instantly to your touches. Beginners might find it useful to increase this setting, but keep in mind that this reduces how snappy and quick to respond VoiceOver will feel.
Double Tap Time Out:
Similar to the last setting, this one lets you adjust how long you can take to perform a double tap. This could be helpful for people who have finger dexterity issues and can't tap twice at the fast pace expected by default.
Large Cursor:
This cursor outlines whatever options are being spoken by VoiceOver. This makes no difference to totally blind people, but may be helpful to people with low vision or to sighted people trying to understand how VoiceOver works.
Caption Panel:
At times, it can be useful for sighted people to see what VoiceOver is speaking and when things are spoken. This can be useful when figuring out how to resolve issues with VoiceOver and to give sighted people a better sense of how VoiceOver works with apps and in various situations. This panel can either be on or off.
Toggle Live Regions Announcement:
This is a new item which can be added to the rotor. It lets you choose whether VoiceOver announces updates to areas of the screen. This should be on nearly all the time, as it's advantageous to hear about such changes in ordinary circumstances. However, there are some websites and other environments where information such as advertisements are refreshing or changing often enough to interrupt your ability to read an article, for example. Turning off the announcement of changes might let you more easily absorb the information you actually need.
VoiceOver Key Commands
Rather than having all of the many key commands in this guide, I'll direct those who are interested to Apple's accessibility page at www.apple.com/accessibility. Go to the Vision page and then to Explore Options for Blind and Low Vision. There, you will find a section called Support, where you can get the full user guide for your product in tagged HTML, Apple Books, or even downloadable Braille. This will also make certain that you're getting the most up-to-date list possible.
    Make use of these commands via the modifier key or keys you choose in VoiceOver settings. I prefer using the Caps Lock key as my modifier, but you may also use the control plus Option key combination. Those keys are at the very bottom of the keyboard, and that works better for some people. In the following list, I'll refer to these modifiers as VO. You hold down that modifier key or keys, and then also press whatever additional key or keys will invoke the command. For example, to enter VoiceOver Help, press VO plus the letter "k". That is, hold down the Caps Lock key or the Control and Option keys, and while holding that down, hit the letter "k". To get people started off, here are some important basic key commands:
    Enter VoiceOver Help - Press VO plus letter k.
    Exit Help and return to previous screens - Press Escape key.
    Go to home screens - Press VO plus letter h.
    Move to status bar - Press VO plus letter m.
    Turn rotor left or right - Press VO plus Command plus Left or Right Arrow.
    Flick up or down on the rotor - Press VO plus Command plus Up or Down Arrow.
    Open Notification Centre - Press VO plus FN and Up Arrow.
    Open Control Centre - Press VO plus FN plus Down Arrow.
    Open Item Chooser - Press VO plus letter i.
    One-finger double tap - Press VO plus Spacebar.
    Two-finger double tap - Press VO plus Hyphen or Dash.
    Swipe up or down - Press VO plus Up or Down Arrow.
    Quick Nav Mode
    For physical keyboard users, Apple has devised a mode called Quick Nav that lets you do a lot of navigating web pages or other things using letters and arrow keys. To activate or deactivate this mode, press VO plus both the Left and Right Arrow keys. While in this mode, you can use the left and right arrows to quickly reach the next or previous element in an app. Use the up and down arrows to move to the next or previous item specified by the rotor. Use letters like "h" and "t" to reach the next heading or table within a website. To move backwards by these amounts, simply use the same letter while holding down the Shift key. It's a really fast and simple way to move around. Just remember to turn off Quick Nav mode when you need to type in fields or edit documents. Be certain to look through Apple's user guide, as there are numerous commands in this mode.
VoiceOver Recognition Capabilities:
In iOS14, the Apple accessibility department decided to take a big step to increase the chances that an app might be useable even when a developer's efforts in that direction came up short. Building on the image description work they previously incorporated, VoiceOver now uses the artificial intelligence onboard more modern devices to gain the ability to recognize text, better describe images, and even recognize other onscreen elements such as controls. Images are now described in more natural full sentences. Any text found in images or on control elements can be read by optical character recognition. Furthermore, artificial intelligence is used by VoiceOver to attempt to recognize different controls and other onscreen elements of apps which haven't been properly labelled by developers for best accessibility results. This will definitely make previously inaccessible apps useable for blind people. However, it also increases the output of VoiceOver as it describes and notifies its users of things which they were previously unaware of.
    IOS 15 gave us further refinements of this more active use of artificial intelligence. The text and image recognition are now at a point when they're extremely useful and responsive. I've rarely found them to be an annoyance. They are often quite useful. Especially when you're on websites or using social media, where you're likely to run into pictures and images. However, screen recognition is another matter. I recommend that it be kept turned off, since it frequently makes otherwise accessible apps impossible to use. Every once in a while, I've come across a situation where it actually proves helpful to recognize a control or button in an app which I otherwise can't find. However, if a developer has done a lot of work making an app pleasantly accessible with VoiceOver, the screen recognition doesn't seem to grasp this and undoes that work.
    I feel compelled to point out the following to lazy developers. This artificial intelligence-based element recognition system doesn't mean you don't have to put in some effort to become familiar with the accessibility tools that Apple has provided. In order to make apps more accessible and delightful to use for people who are blind, developers who know their apps best must put in an effort. Artificial intelligence doesn't do it all for you. There's not even any assurance that these features will even make an app truly useable, let alone enjoyable to use. The experience will always be better if developers do the work to make them that way. I may very well land on an element and learn that it's an image of a hamburger. However, if that image isn't labelled as a button or with the word "menu", I won't know to double tap on that image or that it's the way to access a menu of options. Moreover, if I have to sit through long blasts of information in order to understand what's happening, I will most assuredly be looking for an alternative app. One whose developer paid better attention to how enjoyable and practical my experience as a blind user was. It's quite possible for an app to be technically accessible but utterly impractical and painful to use for blind people.
    The degree to which you will be able to make use of this powerful new capability hinges on how modern your device is. Any device older than an iPHONE 7 will not have the computing power to take advantage of this. It requires the A10 Fusion chip at the oldest. Newer processors will affect how well these features end up working for you. People with older devices may well find that it introduces enough of a delay in responsiveness or other issues that it makes more sense to disable VoiceOver recognition capabilities entirely. I often find that to be preferable when I'm using apps which developers have put serious effort into VoiceOver support. This can be done in VoiceOver settings. Alternatively, you can make use of options on your rotor to turn VoiceOver recognition features on or off in various apps as desired. VoiceOver will keep track of your current choices in this regard, so you won't have to keep taking the time to indicate your recognition preferences as you switch between apps. Settings can also be placed in the new VoiceOver quick settings introduced in iOS15. These are accessed via a two finger quadruple tap.
    The features themselves are automatic for the most part. As you come to images, they will be described if you pause on the image in question long enough. The same applies to any text which might be inside images. It will be read aloud after a pause. The pause isn't a long one. Around a second and a half is plenty of time to wait. Alternatively, you can set the recognition feedback to indicate the presence of information with a short sound.
    People should understand that unleashing artificial intelligence in this way is no trivial exercise. This is a big step forward for VoiceOver. Possibly, the most ambitious capability added to date. I expect that it will require a few years to reach a state of polished maturity. Feedback from users will be absolutely crucial in balancing the amount of information offered with the need for productive speed in the use of apps which require VoiceOver recognition to be useable.
    Improvements in this area will be more subtle for the most part. They won't likely result in new options very often. Instead, people who pay attention to image descriptions, for instance, may notice the quality of those descriptions improving over time. A lot of work has been done on making the artificial intelligence use full sentences to construct descriptions rather than phrases. Recognition of controls and elements in less accessible apps is another key area where the average user may not be aware of improvements as they occur and are released in subsequent versions of iOS.
Keyboard Versus Touchscreen Gestures:
There are commands to do absolutely everything with a physical keyboard. I've just given you enough here to get started. Make use of the VoiceOver keyboard help and look through Apple's user guide to learn about all the commands and get optimum use of your device and keyboard combined.
    Nothing says you need to choose between one or the other. I tend to use my keyboard mainly for typing, and simply reach over with one hand to my iPhone while working at my desk to use gestures. For me, that's far more intuitive and efficient than memorizing all the key commands. If you do a lot of work while travelling, you might find that it's worth learning all of these commands so that you can operate your device while only needing your keyboard to be on your lap while in a vehicle. Your iOS device can be safely packed out of sight while turned on. This can be particularly convenient with wireless Bluetooth headsets or AirPods.
    Compared to some other screen readers, there are fewer commands to learn about. Also, Apple has kept things consistent regarding groups of commands. Once you've learned enough of them, intuiting others gets easier.
Recovering From Unwelcome Silence:
VoiceOver is now over ten years old, but still a far from perfect system. You will inevitably encounter a situation where Braille or spoken input that you expect simply doesn't happen. You'll be in the middle of working on a document and just want to pop over and check out a website. The next thing you know, your device has gone silent. Perhaps, you've decided to try out a new and possibly helpful app, and your device goes unexpectedly quiet. It can happen at the most inopportune times, leaving you with a frustration and sense of powerlessness I'm profoundly familiar with. Trust me. I know that sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach or that vexation that makes you want to throw your device into the nearest wall hard enough to split atoms. I've absolutely been there.
    All sorts of things can cause VoiceOver to lock up. It could be a bug in the operating system. Some apps haven't been designed to work with VoiceOver and may cause it to crash when they are run. Perhaps, a website has been poorly put together and something in it has caused VoiceOver to crash. Sometimes, too much is happening at once and the system just freezes up. In such circumstances, the most natural but counterproductive thing you can do is panic. If you've set up your Accessibility Shortcut as I outlined how to do above, you are actually well-prepared for most of these situations. In all likelihood, your device isn't broken. In the worst case, which isn't at all likely, you may need the assistance of a person with sight to help return your device to a state where VoiceOver is running. Nearly all the time, you will be able to rectify the situation on your own without sighted assistance. Unless you have already reacted in a destructive manner, nothing has been lost but time and your self composure. Take a deep breath, and we'll walk through what needs to be done to recover from such an unfortunate happenstance.
    When VoiceOver stops working, that doesn't necessarily mean that it has completely shut down. You may, in fact, sometimes still hear the small sound effects VoiceOver uses to inform you of things. In any case, it must be completely shut down and restarted to pass the jammed state that it has entered. This can be done in a few different ways. The most drastic step is a hard reset, so let's save that for the last resort. Theoretically, a hard reset shouldn't cause any information to be lost. However, you'll have to wait while your device reboots and will lose your place in whatever you were doing.
    Presuming you're still online via cellular data or Wi-Fi, Siri can come to the rescue. If you've set this up, you could simply say "hey Siri" to cause your digital assistant to perk up its ears. Otherwise, hold down the Home or Power button until you hear a short beep. At that point, tell Siri to "turn off VoiceOver". This makes certain that VoiceOver has shut down completely and can start up fresh. Siri should inform you that VoiceOver is turned off. Every so often, you may have to repeat this process. Next, follow the same process for summoning Siri and ask it to "turn on VoiceOver". Again, you may need to do this more than once, depending on the kind of jam things have gotten into. If all goes well, you should be informed that VoiceOver is turned on and your device should speak or output Braille as normal.
    An even quicker way is to make use of the Accessibility Shortcut. Presuming you've set that up, invoke the shortcut by clicking the Home or Power button three times rapidly. You may have to do this twice to shut down and then reactivate VoiceOver. I've sometimes run into circumstances where I've needed to invoke the shortcut three times to get VoiceOver up and running. Don't forget to pause between each series of three clicks. This will prevent five clicks in a row from being counted. While not quite as consequential as with Monty Python's "The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch", five rapid clicks in a row will activate the emergency SOS mode, which might result in an unintended call to your local emergency services. Perturbing as it is, your device failing to Braille or speak to you really doesn't warrant ambulance, fire truck, or police intervention, so let's not go there.
    I have yet to encounter a circumstance where two or three applications of the Accessibility Shortcut didn't set things right. However, such situations are possible. In that event, you may have to perform a hard reset. This forces your device to completely reboot. To perform a hard reset on a modern iOS device:
1. Push and release the Volume Up button.
2. Push and release the Volume Down button.
3. Push and hold in the Power button on the side of your device. Hold that button in for around ten to fifteen seconds. This should make certain that a hard reset initiates.
At this point, you should wait for at least a minute or two while the reset is hopefully happening. After this pause, you may find that VoiceOver simply start speaking and that things are back to normal. If this isn't the case, you can invoke the Accessibility Shortcut by clicking the Home or Power button three times rapidly. This will work even while your device is locked and offline. Alternatively, you may summon Siri and ask it to "turn on VoiceOver".
    Hopefully, the above steps will help you recover from most situations that result in unexpected silence or lack of response from your device. Don't forget to check the volume level by pressing the Volume Up button a few times. The mute switch doesn't interfere with VoiceOver, so its position shouldn't matter aside from incoming phone calls and other alerts. There are also periods such as while the device is booting up and while updates to the operating system are installed when there can be longer periods of silence. Should you wonder whether your device is turned on, the act of plugging it in to charge or resting it on a wireless charger will force the device to boot up. It will then make a small sound, and you will feel a bump as it finishes the startup process. This bump is actually to inform you that the device is charging, rather than that it has finished booting. If your device isn't plugged in, you won't feel a bump or hear the charging "bing". A bit of tactile feedback when one's device was turned on would have been a very welcome and thoughtful addition on Apple's part. This would help the blind, deaf-blind and even people whose eyes were focused elsewhere to know that their device was powered up.
    People who have an iPhone 14 or newer are in luck. You can enable such feedback including audible and tactile to occur when your device shuts down and is turned on. You'll find this in the accessibility settings under the "hearing" heading. Double tap on audiovisual and flick right until you come to "power on and off sounds". This ability is unavailable on older iPhones because it actually requires hardware only found on the A14 or later chips.
Focus Issues:
There are some occasions where VoiceOver will lose focus on what you're attempting to read or interact with. Some interface elements are trickier than others. A good example is popup menus and dialogues. When I want to share something, I double tap on the Share button. This causes the Share Sheet to appear. This pops up over the app currently in focus to offer a range of options. These include people and apps you may want to send what you're sharing to. There are occasions where this dialogue won't close when you hit the Close button. To extricate yourself from circumstances like this, feel around the screen until VoiceOver says Dismiss Popup Window. At this point, perform a one-finger double tap, and the annoying popup window will disappear.
    Other times, an app's design might prove unusual enough to give VoiceOver trouble. You may find that when you try to do something such as read text in a field, VoiceOver seems to start but cuts off sharply, moving instead to a button or somewhere else in the app. This may be a problem specific to that app. However, it could also be an issue with VoiceOver. It never hurts to inform app developers or the Apple Accessibility Department about such issues. Remember that VoiceOver is constantly evolving as new graphical designs and interface options are made available for app developers to use. Some of these are designed by app developers rather than Apple, so VoiceOver won't always work as well with them. Screen readers are complex things. Most of this complexity happens behind the scenes between the apps we use and the screen reader that tries to keep us informed. Often, app developers will be able to resolve concerns occurring in their apps. However, sometimes, issues will be more widespread and be the result of bugs in the VoiceOver screen reader. In such cases, developers must typically wait for Apple to release an iOS update where improvements to VoiceOver can be made available.
VoiceOver Conclusions
VoiceOver has come a very long way. Back when I got my iPhone 4, VoiceOver had only been around for perhaps a year or so. Even then, I remember how delightful everything was once I had mastered the basics. Apps and websites have gotten more complex as time has passed. VoiceOver has also improved drastically over the same span of time. However, these improvements don't ever seem to make the experience of using VoiceOver feel any more complicated. It still feels just as natural to me now as it did back then. The overall concepts and methods of interface have held up tremendously well. At this point, VoiceOver has really matured to where an iPhone or iPad can be nearly as easy to master and more comprehensive in the capabilities it offers than any product designed specifically for blind people.
    More than most screen readers, VoiceOver bridges the gap and shapes our experience of what it gives us access to. If you can understand the concepts I've gone over in this section, then you've managed to make the largest leap into radical territory necessary to get maximum benefit from your iOS device. Once you've mastered VoiceOver enough to competently use a touchscreen, the rest is just a matter of understanding apps, how they're laid out, and their capabilities. It's a good idea to take time getting a feel for how VoiceOver works and figuring out which settings will work best for you. This is the groundwork upon which all else builds. Now that there's an actual tutorial, things should be much less of a struggle for beginners who are able to grasp how to use a touchscreen. Keep in mind that there will still be people who simply can't make the mental leap needed to productively use a touchscreen, despite all the help now available. It's still a fundamentally unintuitive world for blind people to grasp. For many who are more tech-savvy, accessories such as keyboards, Braille displays and controllers will be enough of a bridge into the more familiar realm of the tactile. Only occasionally will it still be necessary to use the touchscreen. There's no escaping that entirely. At least now, beginners who give Apple iPhones a chance aren't starting out with their hands tied behind their backs by the absence of basic help features which most screen readers have had for nearly two decades. They will have proper help resources built right into the system.
    VoiceOver continues to gain new capabilities. In addition to the Commands and Activities settings, there is also the increased ability to describe pictures and images. This can help make formerly inaccessible apps useable, even if not as elegant as the experience can be when developers actually put effort into polishing accessibility. Most notably, we've seen artificial intelligence unleashed to improve recognition of text, images, and elements of apps including controls. Big leaps forward like this take time to mature, and we've seen improvements to artificial intelligence use by VoiceOver continue. Image descriptions are now using full sentences. Substantial improvements have also been made when it comes to Braille screen input. I would go so far as to say that iOS 18 has been spectacularly rich in VoiceOver improvement. There are still some longstanding bugs. To help Apple address these, people need to report problems they encounter in as much detail as they can. Apple needs to be able to reproduce the issue themselves in order to best determine how to fix it.
    While Apple provides the accessibility tools, it's up to individual app developers how much they use them, presuming they decide to at all. This can make a huge difference. For instance, the game Six Ages makes extensive use of the VoiceOver Hints system to deliver important game information to the player in a convenient way. This makes for a far more enjoyable experience. Adding special hints, image descriptions, and alternative interface elements like custom rotor options can turn an app from accessible but impractical to being outright delightful to use for blind people. Another obvious example is deciding what gets spoken automatically. Too much can be just as annoying as not enough. The user needs to take a bit more of a proactive role when it comes to exploring the screen and actively looking for things like buttons or elements. It's a tradeoff between efficiency and awareness, which lets many apps be far more accessible and practical to use than they otherwise would be.
    Keep in mind that when all of this was initially conceived, there was no app store filled with hundreds of thousands of apps. VoiceOver has grown in capability in similar fashion to how iOS has expanded over the years. Thanks to Apple's control of VoiceOver's development, you can be certain that any app that comes pre-installed on your iOS device will have been made by Apple and will work with VoiceOver to the best degree possible. Apple does a lot to encourage third-party developers to make their apps accessible. However, nothing really forces them to. Don't be surprised if you end up getting an app that just won't work with VoiceOver. Some apps are simply too visual to be made accessible. In other cases, developers genuinely aren't aware that there are blind users. I can't count the number of people I've met who have owned iPhones for years and are still blown away when they learn of all the accessibility tools they never knew existed. Once they decide to make their apps accessible, Apple provides ample resources that help them put VoiceOver and many other tools to maximum good use.
    There's still a lot of room for growth with VoiceOver. I think the biggest bang for buck will come from increasing awareness about it among app developers and the wider public. The overall user experience hinges just as much on efforts of people working outside the walls of Apple as it does on Apple's own considerable efforts to offer the best possible accessibility tools.
    I hope we see an increased willingness to explore and try new apps. I also hope blind people who find themselves frustrated that an app is inaccessible will take the time to contact the developer and express their interest in the app were it to become more accessible. If enough people take this step, many developers will take the time to improve the accessibility of their apps, leading to better experiences for everyone.
    Through VoiceOver, Apple has welcomed blind people into their space. As paying customers, I believe people have every right to complain about accessibility issues with apps and with VoiceOver itself. Through polite and constructive criticism, I believe we have a tremendous opportunity to make a great deal of positive change.

Live Recognition:
Recently, Apple has begun to build in the capability for your iPhone to detect and recognize objects in the real world. This makes use of your iPhone's rear cameras as well as LIDAR, which all Pro models of iPhone come equipped with. If you don't have a Pro iPhone, only some live recognition options will be available to you.
    Basically, the LIDAR system projects an invisible beam of light from a spot near the cameras at the back of your iPhone. This beam bounces off objects reflecting back to a sensor tuned to that specific wave length of light. This makes it possible to accurately measure distance. Therefore, any detection options which provide distance information won't show up on non-Pro iPhones. A good example of this is the furniture detection option. When active, it will give the distance to furniture, such as chairs and tables in a room, as you scan your surroundings.
    Previously, such features were made available in the Magnifier app. This always struck me as incredibly counterintuitive for blind people. Now, these features have been integrated into VoiceOver. The easiest method of accessing Live Recognition features is to use a four finger triple tap. Strike the screen three times in quick succession with four fingers at the same time. Space your fingertips apart a little so that all of them register on each stroke. A rotor option called live recognition has been added as an alternative method of accessing live recognition features. Turning to this option, you can flick up or down with one finger through the available choices. Double-tap on a choice to activate it. As soon as you do either of these things, a pop-up menu appears with all the available live recognition options. You can flick left or right through this menu and turn options on or off as desired by double-tapping on them. If you're done with all live recognition features, flick right to the end of the menu, and you'll find a "stop recognition" button. This ends all live recognition, and the pop-up menu vanishes.
    The point and speak feature requires Lidar to use. It will theoretically allow you to point at controls on an appliance and read any text on a button your finger indicates. This would allow you to make use of otherwise inaccessible machines independently. In practice, I've found this feature challenging to use. It requires that your finger and the controls you want to access be in precise enough focus so that it can determine what you're actually pointing at. Many factors will influence how well this works. The size and spacing of buttons or controls will make a big difference. So will the lighting conditions. How steady you hold your iPhone in one hand while pointing a finger with the other hand will also matter greatly. Doubtless, things will improve over time. However, at present, I would urge extreme caution. Especially if money is at stake. Take your time to make certain you have some sense of orientation to a machine before you start actually using it.
    Apple has kept things very simple. You just point the rear camera at whatever you're interested in, and it reports what's there based on the detection features you currently have activated. It checks continuously for new items which come into focus. This could happen when you move the camera, or perhaps objects or people might move into focus and be described.
    Other than turning detection options on or off, there really aren't any other things you can do to alter how they behave. There's no way to alter things such as the verbosity of descriptions or ask questions about what is found. 
    If you go into VoiceOver settings, you'll find a "Live Recognition" button inside the VoiceOver Recognition settings. In there, you can choose which of the available options will appear in the Live Recognition rotor. You can deactivate options which you have no use for, so it's possible to flick through the ones you want more quickly. It is also possible to reorder options so that the ones you want are near or at the very top. When you turn the rotor to live recognition, it immediately goes to the top option.
    It's really that simple. You'd expect such powerful features to be more complicated to use. However, until more choice is added, the brief paragraphs above tell you everything you need to know in order to put live recognition features to practical use in your everyday life. Provided you feel safe holding your iPhone out in front of you and are able to hear its reports clearly, you're good to go. Scan a room to find an empty chair, or look for the doors as you proceed down a hallway. Find out what kind of plant you just snagged with your shoulder on your way through a lobby. If you're brave enough and not in a rush, try using that otherwise inaccessible vending machine without needing sighted assistance. Just keep in mind that for some of these options, such as point and speak, they haven't been around very long and the results might not be as useful as one might wish. You also need to be good at holding the iPhone steady and directing the rear camera.

The iOS Operating System:
When I upgraded to the Microsoft Windows operating system, I had to stop and learn quite a bit about its main interface and components before doing anything else. Just to be able to shut my system off, find my files, and run programs, I needed to know about the desktop, start menu, and more. DOS was pretty easy to understand. Commands were typed in on a command line and everything was text. Windows was a different animal, designed for people who could see a screen to easily get where they needed using a mouse. This change happened during my time at university, and I really felt that halt in normal activities as I tried to absorb all the new conventions. Thankfully, there was a way to keep using the software I was used to in MS-DOS, such as WordPerfect 5.1. I could tackle assignments while learning the new Windows ways of doing everything.
    For blind people, the whole notion of learning to use a touchscreen is a much larger intuitive leap by orders of magnitude than the one from DOS to Windows. It is a leap into the utterly unfamiliar. It is such a different way of doing things than anything I had used before. However, iOS does so much in the background that you don't have the same need to understand all the core aspects before you actually start to use your device. After setting it up, I merely had to learn enough about how VoiceOver was controlled and then just start doing things I wanted to do. I simply began using my iPhone. Once I had mastered some basic gestures, I was able to plunge right in and start getting things done. Long after I was making and answering calls, creating reminders, playing games, and listening to music, I could learn about the bulk of iOS at my leisure when the need arose. It was more important to master commonly used gestures and where to find things on the screen. While you're figuring out what you need to, iOS is taking care of you, much like a co-pilot on an aircraft. That's why the section on VoiceOver comes before this one in the guide. It seems counterintuitive to learn about the screen reader first. However, the more you explore your device, the more this order of doing things will make sense. Don't worry if you don't grasp everything right away. What I hope to give you is a better overall sense of iOS than I had when I started.
    The iOS operating system is the software that runs your iPhone or iPad. It operates in the background as you accomplish things on your iOS device. It is largely invisible to the user, keeping everything running smoothly and containing features you might not think of as part of an operating system. For example, the VoiceOver screen reader is a part of iOS. So are many other accessibility tools. A lot of the more visible aspects of iOS are presented as apps that are discussed in their own sections. That's a major reason why this section is so much shorter than you might have expected it to be. A good example of this is the Settings app that lets you configure your device. The app store and Music app are two more examples of this kind of thing. As a user, they seem like discrete parts. However, behind the scenes, app developers can tie elements together to create apps that tap into these various capabilities in concert as needed. The same goes for all the accessibility features we will discuss in this book. You'll actually spend a great deal of time learning about aspects of the iOS operating system. It just won't feel that way since its presence takes so many discrete forms.
    Recently, a new fork of the iOS operating system was created. Called iPadOS, it will be used to specifically run iPads from this point onward. The size advantages of iPads make different things possible on their larger screens. Enough differences in layout and use have emerged to make the developers at Apple believe that over time, things will differ more sharply between how one uses an iPhone versus an iPad. The largest difference I noticed was that apps could now be substantially smaller on each platform. I really struggled to make headway with the iPad, and there may very well be other aspects of the change that completely escaped me. As a result of this forking off, iPAD owners will be less well served by this guide as time passes. The core concepts will likely never change completely, since both devices are essentially flat touchscreens. However, there will be gestures and possibly apps which I as an iPHONE owner will have no exposure to. Due to the great need during the pandemic, I decided to give my iPAD away to someone who could make far better use of it. I will be exclusively using iPHONES from now on. Tablets just won't work well for me given my spacial difficulties.
    iOS does a whole lot of things completely behind the scenes to give a smooth and intuitive user experience. Examples include managing power consumption, encrypting and decrypting information on the fly, monitoring your device's temperature, checking for new information, and interpreting finger movements on the touchscreen known as gestures. These include such things as taps involving one or more fingers, swipes, and flicks, etc. These may seem strange at first, but will eventually become very intuitive as you do more with your device. iOS controls all the other hardware in your device such as memory, audio input and output, reading sensors, and other functions. It also makes certain that files are kept organized and are kept with the apps that use them. You need never worry about where a given file is if you don't want to. This greatly simplifies things, especially for more casual, less tech-savvy users. However, when you want to take more personal charge of aspects like this, iOS provides the tools you require.
    Though much of iOS is hidden, it presents users with facilities for interaction with our devices. It is primarily designed for people with sight. The touchscreen displays many icons that represent apps or actions that users may take. Below, I'll take you on a tour of the major elements you'll be interacting with. Some things like the Settings app will be discussed in their own sections. iOS has some standard conventions that this section will familiarize you with. Once those are mastered, things will feel quite intuitive. We'll start all of this with a brief discussion of what is meant by "apps".
What Apps Are:
Like other operating systems, iOS comes with many programs and functions built in. Other developers create pieces of software that build on parts of the iOS operating system to create more capabilities. Apps, short for "applications", are these programs that allow you to perform tasks on your device. They do everything from playing your music to letting you send and receive email. I'm using an app called Ulysses to write this guide. It is a word-processing app made especially for authors of long documents like this one. At the same time I'm writing this section, another app called Nature space fills my ears with the sound of wind blowing through an aspen forest, waves on a beech, or any of dozens of other natural soundscapes. I often add modern instrumental music to this with the Music app from Apple. I'm especially fond of piano pieces while writing. Beyond the apps that come with iOS, people have made hundreds of thousands of additional apps. You can obtain these from the app store, which we'll discuss later on in this guide. There are many apps developed especially for blind people. Others have been made accessible when developers were made aware of blind users. You would do yourself a grave disservice if you failed to avail yourself of at least some apps beyond what comes on your device. For this section, however, we'll stick to what comes pre-installed.
    Apple has produced some free apps that either come pre-installed with iOS or may be freely obtained from the app store if people want them. The apps that come pre-installed offer a good range of basic starting capabilities for your device. If you have an iPhone, it will have a Phone app that gives you all the functions you'd expect from an actual phone. Other apps include a calendar, calculator, reminders list, a note-taking app, the music app, a web browser called Safari, and many more. If a kind of technology is present in your device, you'll find an app letting you make use of it. The Maps app, for instance, gives you a robust set of navigation abilities using the GPS receiver and other location-finding capabilities in your device.
    Feel free to explore and try out these apps you find on your device without worrying that you'll cause any harm. You can't do any damage to your device by this kind of exploration. When you want more capabilities than are currently found on your iOS device, you will want to make use of the App Store app. That's where to go to find apps to do an astonishing array of things. The app store is a critical piece of iOS that warrants its own section later in this guide.
    Much like the desktop and taskbar on Windows, iOS presents its users with some constantly available screen elements. These are present, regardless of what device you use and which orientation you have your device in. While inside an app or folder, these elements may be hidden from view. However, you will always be able to reach them by exiting the app or via special gestures.
The Status Bar:
At the very top of your screen, you'll find a thin strip of indicators known as the status bar. Some apps will hide this when they're being used, but touching anywhere at the top of the screen may result in the focus being put in the status bar. Towards the top centre, you will end up in the area of the dynamic island which essentially breaks the status bar into two areas. There are numerous indicators. Exactly which ones you'll find depends on the capabilities of your device. There is nothing you can do to alter what appears on the status bar. Flicking left or right will travel over the indicators and read them out. At the very left of my iPhone's status bar is a signal strength indicator showing one to four bars depending on how good my connection to the cellular network is. The indicator to the immediate right informs me that it is a 5G network. Farther right, there is a Wi-Fi strength indicator showing one to three bars. The three bars it currently displays tell me that my current connection is the best possible. To the right of that, there is a clock. Past that, the battery charge indicator can be found at the right end of the line. At times, other indicators can appear. One might specify whether your device's orientation is locked, meaning that the positions of items on the screen will stay the same if you rotate your device. Another might inform you that your location is being tracked by one or more apps. This can be the GPS app you're using to get around, or other apps requiring location information which are running in the background. Don't worry if you don't know some of these terms. All will be revealed in due time.
    That status bar also serves as a gateway to a couple of important areas of iOS normally hidden from view; namely, the Control Centre and Notification Centre. Both of these areas are described later in this section.
How to Do It:
To get to the Control or the Notification Centre, do the following:
1. Touch anywhere on the status bar with one finger and then lift it.
2. Next, use three fingers to make a swiping motion on the screen upward for the Control Centre or downward for the Notification Centre.
3. To exit either area of iOS and return to the app you were in or the home screens, push the Home button.
More recent models of iPad and iPhone don't have home buttons. They also have thinner status bars. To compensate for this, VoiceOver users can do the following to reach various places:
How to Reach the Control and Notification Centres:
1. Put your finger right at the top of the screen. You should hear a short beep and feel a very brief vibration.
2. Move your finger downward until you feel a second vibration. Release your finger at that point to reach the Control Centre.
3. Go past that second beep and keep moving your finger downward until you hear a third and higher-pitched beep. You will feel a quick vibration. Lift your finger at that point to be taken to the Notification Centre.
How to Reach the Home Screens and App Switcher:
1. Place your finger at the very bottom of the screen. You should hear a short beep and feel a brief vibration.
2. Move your finger upward slowly until you feel a second vibration and hear a short beep. Release your finger at that point to reach the home screens.
3. To reach the ap switcher, continue moving your finger upwards until a third vibration and higher-pitched beep are encountered. Lift your finger off the screen at that point to be taken to the App Switcher.
The Dynamic Island:
Until the arrival of iOS 17, the dynamic island was a feature only found on Pro iPhones. The area at the very centre of the top of the screen was a blank spot called the notch. Behind this blank patch was where the sophisticated camera and Face ID scanners were housed. For sighted people, this was regarded as a less attractive aspect of their iPhones. To make lemonade out of lemons, Apple basically decided to surround this notch with a new pill shaped special area called the dynamic island. Able to shrink, expand and change shape as needed, it is used to display information from apps in a way which doesn't require a notification or having to go into the app.
    Machine learning is used in conjunction with taking account of your actions to determine what, if anything, is displayed on the dynamic island at any given moment. Perhaps, you have a delivery from a restaurant on the way. Apps such as Uber Eats will display the estimated arrival time on the dynamic island. Touching on the island and flicking down with one finger will bring up an option to expand the island to reveal more details. Double tap with one finger on the expand option to cause the island to grow. This makes space for more information, which may cover other contents of the screen. Flicking down on the island will uncover a "shrink" option which causes it to revert to the more minimal size. Double tapping with one finger on the dynamic island will move you into the app which is displaying information in the island area.
    As developers make more use of this feature, there may be more interactive possibilities. Flicking up or down with one finger after touching the island should reveal any such options.
The Home Screens and Slider:
Below the status bar, you'll find a page full of icons representing apps. When you first get your device, there will be a couple of pages containing apps that come shipped with iOS. Later on, you may obtain so many apps that you will want to put them into folders. For now, though, each name you flick to or touch will be an app. Double tapping on a selected app will activate it and give it focus. You can double tap on an app after reading its name or feel around to find an app you're interested in and then, while holding your exploring finger down, tap anywhere on the screen with another finger. Either method works and results in the same thing.
    Once you go into an app, it takes the space below the status bar for itself because it is "in focus". Currently, the Ulysses app I'm writing this on is what's in focus. To get to other apps, I would need to make use of the Home button on an older device or the equivalent gesture on the iPhone 16 Pro that I'm using. However, I can still touch the status bar. This lets me check such things as the time, battery level, and connectivity without actually leaving the app I'm working in.
    As you acquire more apps, you will have more home screens. Depending on your choices, you may have additional apps available in the app library. You can swipe left and right with three fingers to move between home screens of apps. Think of them like pages in a book. At most, you can have fifteen unhidden pages of apps on your iOS device. I'm unaware of any limit to how many hidden pages you can have or how many apps can be available in your app library. Double tapping on an app icon will open it, making it the app in focus. If you don't know what a double tap or swipe is, see the previous section on VoiceOver, where such gestures as these are explained in detail.
    Are you trapped on a single page of your apps? If you haven't mastered the three-finger swipe, there's another way to get around. It's called a "slider". It can be found one flick beyond the last app on the page, just before you get to the dock. Touching near the bottom-right corner of the screen often gets you there. For a more reliable way to reach it, do the following:
1. Touch the middle of the bottom of your screen. This will put you on a row of apps called "the dock". We'll discuss the dock below these instructions.
2. Flick left with one finger. You will likely hear the name of an app such as Safari, Phone, or Settings. Before the name of the app, you'll hear VoiceOver say "dock", which indicates that you're in the dock.
3. Flick left over any apps until you hear VoiceOver say, for example, "page 2 (of however many pages there are)". This changes as you acquire more apps. VoiceOver will also give you a hint about what to do here on the page slider.
4. Flick up or down with one finger while on this slider to transition between pages of apps. You can also use this to reach the Today view by flicking down past page one. Finally, you can use this slider to reach the app library by going up past your last home screen. More on those areas later.
The Dock:
Another special area at the bottom of the screen deserves brief explanation. It is called the Dock. Depending on the size of your device, this area contains four or more slots for apps you want to keep handy at all times. Apps can be moved in and out of the dock as desired. The size of your dock cannot be adjusted. As you acquire more apps, they will fill more pages on your home screen. Your home screen only has room for a certain number of apps, so that's why they are divided into pages of apps or put in folders containing apps that fit between your status bar and the dock at the bottom. If you find that you frequently want to make use of a particular app, such as the Safari browser or the Phone app, stick it in the dock so that it's always handy. As you gain more home screens full of apps, you'll increasingly appreciate the convenience of the dock.
    It is always possible to move apps in or out of the dock. You may wish to do this as your needs change over time. Later in this section, we'll take a closer look at how to move apps around and organize them.
The Today View:
From your first page of apps, swipe right with three fingers. Presuming you're using iOS 10 or later, this will take you to a special page called the Today view. This is an area that has been designed to give you a kind of overview of information that is important to you in one place. The idea is that you can quickly look through this screen, much like the front page of your own personal newspaper, and find out any essential information. You can customize what information is kept updated in the Today view, as well as the order in which it is presented.
    Navigating between widgets can be a little tricky. Formerly, things were divided by heading, so you could quickly move between blocks of information delivered by the widgets different apps make available. As of iOS14, this has proved to be less consistent. At times, you can use the containers option on the rotor to navigate through elements. However, this doesn't always take you out of one widget's information into the next. Hopefully, they'll return to using headings consistently here, or else make each separate widget its own container.
    What is a widget? Essentially, widgets are extensions of apps that can be added to your Today view page. This serves as both an entry point into the app and a place where potentially important information from it can be displayed. This quite often eliminates the need to go into the full app. The contents will change as you acquire and use more apps. Not all apps have been equipped with accompanying widgets. If you download apps that have widgets, you will notice an item at the bottom of your Today view that informs you that new widgets are available. Once you have gone into the edit area where you can add, remove, and reorder widgets, those new widgets will be highlighted and labelled as new.
    Move through the options by flicking left or right with a finger. You can double tap on a button to activate it, and flic up or down with one finger to access other options when told that actions are available.
    Information displayed by each widget can frequently be configured to your liking through related settings. These will either be found right in the specific app in question or else in the main Settings app discussed in a later section of this guide. These widgets will almost always offer more functionality than simply displaying content or proceeding into the full app they represent. You may, for instance, be able to reply to a message, open a particular news story, or return to your current place in a book you were reading recently, etc. While it isn't essential to make any use whatsoever of the Today view, it can be an effective and convenient summary of activity and information important to your daily life.
How to Edit Widgets in the Today View
While on a widget, flick down to reach the "Edit mode" option. Double tap on this to enter the edit mode. In this mode, widgets are inactive. They become pieces which you can reorder, insert, and remove from your Today view. The first thing you encounter is a button in the top-left corner called "add widget". We'll come back to that button very soon.
    The rest of the editing screen is taken up with a list of widgets already present in your Today view. Beside each widget name is a Reorder button. If you feel competent enough, you can double tap and hold your finger down on any of these reorder buttons and then drag your finger up or down the screen, thereby moving the widget. You will be told which widgets you're moving above or below. Alternatively, if you prefer not to use this method, you can simply touch the name of a widget and then flick down until you here the "move up" or "move down" options. Double tap the desired option, and the selected widget will move one spot in the ordered list. If you want to remove a widget, flick down on the widget name in the list. You'll come to a "delete" option. Double tap this to remove the widget from the Today view. Don't worry about the apps. Doing this won't delete them. Just the widget.
    Now, let's have a look at how to add widgets. Double tap on the "add widget" button. The first thing you'll find is a search field letting you look for specific apps you want widgets for. Next is a list of suggestions which your iPhone's artificial intelligence thinks you might want to add. These suggestions continue as you flick right over them. They end with a button called "smart stack". This is a stack of widgets which tries to present the app or information you're most likely to want at any given time.
    Past this "Smart stack" button. You'll find buttons for any apps on your device which have widgets available. Not all apps do. Double tap on a button to be taken to the widget configuration screen. There, you can choose the size of the widget you want to create. Larger widgets can show more information. Use the page slider to select between small, medium, and large. Once you're satisfied, double tap on the "add widget" button to put the widget at the bottom of the Today view. Things work the same way if you're adding widgets to the home screen. Just keep in mind that you'll be using up space which might otherwise contain apps. You can stack widgets of the same size on top of each other. Stacks can be smart stacks which try to predict and display the information or app you most likely want at any given time. You can also create stacks which don't exhibit this behaviour, leaving it up to you to change between widgets. While on a widget stack, you can go to the next or previous widget by flicking up or down until you hear the option you want. At that point, perform a one finger double tap.
Widget Wisdom:
When organizing your own Today view, I think you'll find it best to put the information you are most likely to need at the top. In my case, that means the Battery widget takes top spot. In addition to the battery level of your iOS device, that widget also shows the battery levels of any accessories you're using which report that information to iOS. This includes my AirPods, Bluetooth keyboard, and possibly other accessories I might need. There's no other place in iOS where all of that information is readily available. That's easily the most frequently checked item on my Today view.
    Rather than making better use of the Today view, I habitually go into the full app, which contains the information that I want most of the time. The Today view really shines when you require a quick update of information which changes constantly. Widgets don't display very in-depth information, even when they are set to "show more" rather than "less". When organizing my "Today view", I think in terms of quick information or utility delivered from the top down. There comes a point where it would just be quicker to simply open the full app containing information. As a result, I don't have anywhere near all the widgets that I could have included in my Today view. I have hundreds of apps, and a good many of them offer their own widgets. At least three dictionary apps offer such things as the "word of the day". ThePCalc app was my calculator of choice right up until iOS 18 when Apple finally upgraded its calculator. It offers a widget allowing for quick calculations right from your Today view. However, I would just a soon be in the full app if I needed its mathematical help. For similar reasons to this, I choose not to use many widgets. You might well choose diferently. If I'm going to put those resources to use, I find it just as convenient to go into the full app. However, you might really like having a "Todayview" full of many widgets containing capabilities and constantly refreshed information. That refreshing activity will cost some battery power and data, but shouldn't use prodigious amounts of either.
    Below the Battery widget, I have a Weather widget which shows a short daily forecast. Below that, I have a Calendar widget. This will show me any upcoming events as well as any reminders with approaching due dates. Because many of my reminders don't have du dates, the Reminders widget is right beneath the Calendar widget. Below that, I have the Parcel widget which I can check for any parcels on the way. This completes my personal Today view. It's quickly navigated and concise.
    As of iOS14, it has become possible to place one or more widgets on your home screens taking the place of apps. A great deal can be customized should you wish to make use of this. You could, for example, have news and weather widgets near the top of your first home screen. Increasingly, widgets have become a bit less interactive and more oriented to displaying possibly valuable information to be taken in at a glance. However, they still serve as gateways to the full apps which they belong to. In exchange for some room for apps, it's possible to put differently sized widgets onto home screens, which can make vital information more handy in some circumstances. This may be particularly handy for low-vision users. Some have put clock widgets on their home screens since they found the clock on the status bar too small to read easily.
    There are different sizes of widgets which can display different amounts of information in exchange for space on a home screen. Large widgets can take up a square of space which would otherwise contain four apps. As a totally blind user, I have yet to conceive of circumstances where this seems at all desirable. Provided the app with the information you want isn't numerous home screens away from the one you're on, you may as well just go into the full app and get what you need. There's always the app switcher as well. Admittedly, as you keep more apps opened and active, it can take longer to get to the app you want via the switcher.
The Control Centre
The Control Centre may be accessed by first touching the status bar. It doesn't matter which icon you touch. After you do this, swipe upwards with three fingers. Alternatively, you can get there by the following method:
1. Touch the top of the screen with one finger and listen for a short beep.
2. Keeping your finger on the screen, move slowly downward until a higher pitched beep is heard. Release your finger at that point.
The device should then announce "Control Centre" followed by the control currently in focus. This will most likely be Airplane mode, which should normally be off. The Control Centre contains a number of sliders and buttons that let you change some settings on your iOS device. These are settings that people are likely to want to change often. They're typically simple in nature, and have on/off states such as for Airplane mode, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi. Double tapping on these will toggle them on and off as desired. Turning Wi-Fi and Bluetooth off when these capabilities are not needed can make your battery last longer. The Airplane mode button turns off all external communications from your phone, making certain that it doesn't send signals that might interfere with flight operations. It can be handy if you want to make very certain you aren't disturbed by incoming information. However, in most situations, setting the Do Not Disturb focus mode to "on" with the Focus button in the Control Centre will be preferable, since information can still be sent and unobtrusively received by your device.
    The Orientation Lock bears special mention. It locks how icons are oriented in either landscape or portrait mode. I typically have my iPhone locked in Portrait mode so that things are arranged with the status bar by the camera and speaker and the dock is above my USB-C port. Landscape mode is useful for people who want a longer distance from left to right. For example, you may want this orientation when editing documents to have more of the lines visible at once. Sometimes, more options and information is revealed while in landscape mode. The TV app is a good example of this. If you want to take advantage of extras like director interviews or making of features included with movies, you can only get at this content while in landscape mode. Some games, like Six Ages: Ride Like The Wind, require landscape mode and will force your iPhone into landscape mode while you use it. Regardless of the orientation lock settings, some apps will require you to operate them in landscape mode. For sighted users, this makes a big difference depending on what they are viewing.
    Other settings have sliders that can be controlled with up or downward flicks. These settings include the Brightness and Volume controls. You'll notice three buttons that are different from these two kinds of settings controls. These buttons let you access the Clock, Calculator, and Camera apps. Should you be playing music or other audio such as podcasts, you'll also find Previous, Pause, and Next buttons in the Control Centre. It's all very immediate and simple. To leave the Control Centre, press the Home button, if your device has one. If not, use the appropriate gesture to return to your home screen.
    As of iOS 12, you can highly customize what is found in the Control Centre. You can also choose whether it can be accessed on the lock screen or while within apps. Depending on your preferences for security versus convenience, this can prove useful. You take these actions in the Settings app in the Control Centre section, which is found next to the General section. Adding, removing, and reordering controls is very similar to how editing widgets worked, so I'll leave this for you to figure out at your leisure.
    As of iOS 18, you can customize the control centre even more. While in the control centre, touch a control and then flick up or down with one finger. You should hear VoiceOver say "edit controls". Double tap on this, and you will be in a screen which lets you reorder, add and remove controls. This works in similar fashion to how you would add, arrange or remove apps from your home screens.
The Notification Centre
The Notification Centre is a very crutial component for all iPhone users to be familiar with. Information from many apps on your phone will be recorded in this centre, where it awaits your convenience. Too busy talking on the phone to deal with a message? Check the Notification Centre after you've finished the conversation, and you'll find it there. Results of actions that occur in the background while you're focused on something else will also appear in the Notification Centre. These could be updates from social media apps, reports from apps keeping you informed of news, weather updates, etc.
    After touching the status bar, swipe downward with three fingers to open the Centre. Alternatively, you can follow the same procedure used to reach the Control Centre, the only difference being that you keep moving your finger down further until a third high-pitched beep is heard. Release your finger at that point, and you'll reach the Notification Centre. To learn more about this area of iOS, please read the section titled "Notifications".
Moving and Managing Apps:
When I first moved into my current apartment, it didn't really feel like a home. Much of the furniture was new to me. So were all the appliances the apartment came equipped with. I had to get used to where everything was and figure out where I wanted my various possessions. Remembering what went where took some time. Eventually, though, all of that became second nature. Gradually, normal life started happening in my apartment. I had guests over, worked on creative projects, and volunteered in the community. One day, it struck me that this place no longer felt like somewhere I was passing through. It felt like my home.
    In a very real sense, your iOS device is a kind of digital home. It is a place where your digital life can happen and grow. Your home screens and the apps you choose to acquire are your appliances, entertainments, decorations, and working tools. I realize that most people reading this guide will be newcomers to the iOS ecosystem. You more than likely haven't even begun to explore the app store for items of interest. However, it seems sensible to include some remarks on organization of apps here so that as your collection increases, you'll have an idea of why doing so can be well worth the time spent. If nothing else, you might find that it helps your iOS device feel more like it actually belongs to you and in your life. That can help decrease any feelings of trepidation you may have about your new device.
    Eventually, you'll want to put the apps you have into an order more suitable to your needs. Doing this is much like solving a puzzle with the apps being pieces. For blind people, solving this puzzle used to be an excruciating process of careful touches, finger pinches and being ever so careful. Earlier, I mentioned that double tapping on an app will cause it to open. This is the normal state of affairs. However, there is an Edit mode that changes this. Instead of activating, apps become inactive puzzle pieces that can be picked up, put down, tucked away into folders, or removed completely from home screens either totally deleted or hidden in your limitless app library. You can enter this edit mode in two ways. Simply double tap and hold your finger on an app until you're informed that Edit mode has been activated. Alternatively, flick up or down after touching an app and double tap when you hear VoiceOver say Edit mode.
    If you're in this Edit mode, double tapping on an app will delete it. You will be asked if you're certain you want to delete the app, so don't worry about accidentally deleting an app. Touching an app will highlight it. This is also called "selecting" an app. Once an app has been selected, it can be used as a marker for where you would like to place apps you're currently dragging. Otherwise, flick up or downward, and you'll go through a series of options that can be performed with a double tap. These change to fit current circumstances and include adding the app to those being dragged, dropping apps you're dragging before or after the selected app, adding apps being dragged into the contents of a folder, etc.
How to Move Apps:
Once in the Edit mode discussed above:
1. Touch the app you want to move. You can also flick left and right to select the desired app.
2. Once the correct app is selected, flick down to reach the Drag or Ad to Drag option. Double tap on this with one finger. A series of three rising clicks will happen to indicate that the app has been picked up and is being dragged.
3. If you wish to add more apps at once, you can freely scroll with three-finger swipes between pages if necessary to find the apps you want to add to the bucket. You can simply double tap on them, and the default behaviour will be to add them to the drag in progress. Remember to pick them up in the order you want them, or you'll have to rearrange them later.
4. Now that you've picked up one or more apps, it's time to head to where you want to put them. Again, you can scroll around, even between pages, to reach the desired location. Once you're on the right page, touch or flick to any app. Flick up or down through the menu of options, which will include dropping the carried app or apps before or after the destination app. You will also find an option to make a folder with the dragged apps plus the destination app. A name will automatically be given to the newly created folder based on the nature of the apps involved. However, you can rename this folder once it has been created. Simply double tap on the option you desire, and it will be done.
5. If you wish, you can use this method within folders to organize apps. For instance, moving favourite apps to the top of the folder to be more quickly accessed.
6. To exit this editing mode, press the Home button or perform the home gesture to return to normal operation. Your device should say "finished editing". For devices without a Home button, simply use the appropriate gesture to reach the home screen. Don't worry. There's no way to become stuck in edit mode forever. Wait for around 30 seconds without doing anything, and the edit cession will time out, returning you automatically to your home screens. There is also a Done button found at the top left of any home screen you may be editing. It's right next to another button which allows you to add widgets if you so desire.
Let us assume that you've elected not to simply leave apps where they are placed by default. There are several alternatives. You can arrange apps as discussed above. Also, rather than using the home screens, you can make use of the search field in the app library. After double tapping on this field, flick right, and you'll find a list of all apps on your iPhone in alphabetical order. Perhaps, you want all apps placed onto home screens in alphabetical order. There is a way to accomplish this for apps other than the ones on your first home screen. Just keep in mind that when you acquire any new apps, you'll need to manually put them in their correct place, since nothing maintains the alphabetical order. There's no way to just tell iOS that you'd like all future apps put in alphabetical order. One problem with this method is that apps you might use for related things might be numerous home screens apart from each other. You might, for instance, need to scroll through a number of home screens after opening the Audible App to hear a lecture to reach and open the app you'll use to take notes on that lecture. The more apps you get, the more home screens you eventually need to swipe through. However, if you don't have very many apps or find that knowing where everything is comes more naturally if they're ordered alphabetically, that peace of mind may prove worth the drawbacks. If you wish to use this method of organization, here's how:
How to Put Apps in Alphabetical Order:
Rather than have apps be in folders, some people would simply like all apps to be in alphabetical order. There is a roundabout way to accomplish this. Be warned though. This method will destroy any folders you've previously created. After you complete the following steps, you'll find that your home screen has been reset to how it was initially. Any apps beyond the ones present on that screen will be arranged in alphabetical order. This can save a lot of time dragging and dropping apps. To proceed, do the following:
1. Double tap the Settings app.
2. Flick right with one finger until you find General. Double tap on the General button.
3. Touch near the bottom right of the screen. You want to find the Reset button. If you don't land right on it, flick left or right until you encounter it. Double tap this button.
4. Flick through the options until you come to Reset Home Screen Layout. Double tap on this.
5. Flick right, and you'll hear an explanation of what this option will do. Flick right again, and you'll find a Reset button. Double tap this and your home screen layout will be reset. All apps that aren't part of what was originally on your home screen will be arranged in alphabetical order.
The Allure and Frustration of Folders:
A far more common approach to keeping one's apps tidy is to place them all in category folders. This way, you eliminate the need to scroll through home screens. In pretty much any imaginable circumstance, all folders you have to create will fit on page 2, which is your first home screen. If necessary, additional categories would appear on subsequent home screens. You might have a folder for apps you use for work. Another would contain apps used for navigating. Another would have any games you chose to acquire, and so on. These descriptively named folders make it very intuitive to know where to look for whatever you might want or need. One is left with a very grownup, business-like utilitarian first impression. Within those folders, apps can be left where they appear with none the wiser, unless they go snooping on you. For increased efficiency, you can arrange apps in your folders so that the ones most often used are at the top.
    I've found that using folders has a couple of annoying drawbacks. One of these is that while a folder is open, you can't get to the status bar or dock until the folder is closed. Do this either by entering an app or exiting the folder via the Home button or equivalent gesture. You also introduce the extra step of opening the folder you require before getting to the desired app. As you gain more apps, this will quite possibly be worth it for you, as you'll be spared multiple swipes to reach the right home screen. You may still need to swipe between pages within a folder, but chances are that you'll need fewer swipes to get where you have to be. This is especially true if you take the time to keep the apps within your folders optimally arranged.
    Folders are easy to create. You simply drag one app that you'd like to be inside a folder and instead of choosing to drop the app before or after the other, choose the Create Folder option. This results in a folder being created with two apps being placed inside. Once this has been done, the folder may be entered via a double tap. While inside a folder, flick up or down on an app to reach the "edit mode" option. Double tap it to enter Edit mode. You will then be able to rename the folder if you wish, as well as move apps around or eject them from the folder. When folders open or close, VoiceOver will emit a brief rising or falling sliding sound cue. It will also announce "folder opening or closing" if Hints are enabled.
The App Library:
Rather than make use of folders, Apple gave us another option in iOS14. The app library stores any apps on your iPHONE or iPAD. This includes apps on your home screen as well as apps you choose to remove from your home screen but don't want to delete outright. Adding an app to the library is simply a matter of dragging it there while in edit mode and dropping it in. There's no need to organize anything. The app library takes care of all that for you, placing apps into categories created by descriptive tags which app developers put on their apps and artificial intelligence on your device. You may very well question some choices the artificial intelligence makes when it comes to categorizing apps. However, it's all kept nice and tidy.
    Because of this library, you can now hide home screens you no longer need. If I chose to, I could get by with perhaps as few as nine home screens of apps. These would only contain a fraction of the apps I currently have. The rest of my apps are kept neatly waiting in the app library.
    Hiding home screens you no longer want is done in the edit mode. While in edit mode, Go to the page slider, where you usually flick up or down to move through different home screens. Rather than flicking, double tap. You'll be taken into a new area of edit mode, which lets you flick left and right through a list of home screens. Double tap on a home screen's number to hide it or make it visible again. It's that simple. It is also possible to drag and drop home screens to change their order. Things have gotten very flexible indeed.
    You move apps from home screens into the library via the edit mode. Get into that by flicking down on an app on any home screen and double tapping after it says, "edit mode". Once you're in edit mode, you can move apps easily. Double tap on an app to drag it. You can drag multiple apps at once. Drop them by finding where you want to put them, and then flick up or down to go through possible actions. Double tap on the desired option to have it done. If you choose to delete an app, you'll find a new option to move it into your library instead of completely deleting it. This removes an app's icon from your home screen, reducing clutter but keeping the app available in the library. Doing this with enough apps can eliminate entire home screens.
    You can also find apps in the library and drag them onto home screens. While in the edit mode, you'll have one extra home screen available if you don't already have the maximum fifteen visible. This extra home screen is completely empty. This is a spot to drop apps if there's no room on other home screens, or you don't want to bother finding where empty space is. When you leave edit mode, apps will automatically move into any free spaces on home screens which are already there if there's room. To actually move into the library, go past the extra screen and VoiceOver should say "showing app library" or just "app library". You can't seem to choose which category in the library to drop an app into. You simply drop it in the library, and it's automatically put into a category.
    App library organization happens automatically using tags which app developers add to their apps when they put them in the app store. This may result in some apps ending up in categories which seem arbitrary or different from where you might think an app should go. Think of an app like Voice Dream Reader. Some people use it for education. Others would use it for entertainment. Within the categories, apps which are used most frequently are found near the top. In fact, when you're looking through the library, you'll find three of the most commonly used apps followed by the category name. Double tap on an app to activate it. Double tap on a category title to go into that category. Once inside a category, you can browse through all the apps in it. The most frequently used are nearest to the top.
    There are other ways of browsing or searching the app library. At the top of the library, you will find a search field. Double tap this, and you have a couple of options. If you remember the name of the app you want, you can type part or all of it into the search field. Otherwise, flick right of the field, and you'll find an alphabetical list of all of your apps. This is automatically maintained, so anybody who wants their apps in alphabetical order should really just hide their home screens and use the search option at the top of the app library. You can easily scroll up or down using three finger swipes through the list of all of your apps. Flick up or down on the index to jump to a particular letter, and then flick right to browse apps beginning with that letter. Double tap on an app to open it.
    There are a couple of settings relevant to the app library. A new item in Settings is called "home screen". You'll find settings in there which let you decide to add any new apps you obtain from the app store directly to the library, rather than adding them to a home screen. There's also a setting in there which lets you decide whether to show notification badges from the app library. This determines whether you'll be shown notification badges while in the library if apps have such badges. For instance, I have a notification badge for fantastical which shows the date of the month. I would encounter that in the library if I put Fantastical there. Some people would prefer just to have the app names visible in the library and check for notifications from those apps elsewhere. People wanting to minimize home screens will appreciate having new apps added to the library and then being more selective about what to add to home screens manually.
My Easy Path to Relaxed Organization:
As you might imagine, I've tried just about all the alternative approaches iOS makes available over the past years. The last thing I want to spend much time doing is keeping apps organized. Convenience will always trump neatness in my book. This isn't a pricy decoration. It's a tremendously useful tool of life. From quite early on, I had an abundance of apps. It didn't take long for me to realize that leaving them where they were placed wasn't going to cut it. I determined that having my apps alphabetically arranged just wasn't going to suit me at all. It felt painfully rigid and inflexible. It took years for Apple to come up with a less painful way of moving one's apps around. Once moving files became enjoyable and not a form of torture, I gave folders a good crack. While it certainly felt spiffy having everything essentially fit on my default home screen, there were things I grumbled about. Having to open a folder before doing anything felt very clunky and restrictive to me. I got into the habit of keeping a whole lot of apps open and running just so I wouldn't have to go into their folders. My app switcher was very long and unwieldy. Once apps were open, I could use the app switcher to switch between them. This helped, but only a little. It took many flicks to get to the one I wanted. Over time, more of the apps I used most frequently, or wanted quickly, began to come out of their folders. These soon filled first one, then two, and then more pages before I eventually gave up on folders entirely for a while. Now, thanks to the app library, I have completely done away with any folders. Apps are either useful enough to be on one of my home screens, or else they're in the library. It's very nice being able to drop apps in there and let artificial intelligence keep them organized. Like having a magic bag which sorts what's tossed in.
    Over time, one develops a muscle memory of precisely where to touch to find a given app on a home screen. Even soon after you settle on an arrangement of apps, you'll begin to be able to touch very close to where an app you want is, and then merely flick left or right to land VoiceOver on it. Eventually, the process becomes an almost subconscious thing you don't really even think about. The advantage of mainly using the numbered home pages rather than folders is that as I gather more apps, I can simply drop them on the page range in which they belong. No need to maintain folders or specific order beyond keeping the most important apps on the first page of a given range. Everything can simply expand as necessary with a minimum of fuss.
Data Storage;
Stashing and Stowing Your Digital Stuff:
    The whole concept of what a smartphone could be used for has changed drastically since 2011 when I got my first iPhone. At the time, 16 gigabytes seemed like plenty of space. Apps were small. Personal data didn't require much room, either. Audiobooks and music were the only major storage hogs in the foreseeable future. The five gigs of iCloud space were more than I needed for several years. As a result, it was most of a year of using my iPhone quite heavily before I really had to learn about managing storage space. Everything had just kept on working so nicely. There eventually came a point where I had filled the capacity of my iPhone with music, apps, and books, etc. An update was available, but I didn't have enough room to install it unless I deleted something. It was time I looked into where everything was and how to manage it.
    It helps to have a historical perspective. Until fairly recently, Apple didn't give you much detail on where all your data was. The iOS operating system was originally designed to run iPhones. These were conceived of as a combination cellphone and iPod with some added communications capability such as managing email. Keeping things simple for the user was of absolutely paramount importance to Apple. Originally, there wasn't going to be an app store. Apple was going to develop all the apps for the iPhone. It was only after over a year of iPhones existing that this whole principle of containment changed, and an app store was created. It had arrived perhaps a year before I got my iPhone 4. Developers were still in the process of figuring out what was possible and what users were willing to pay for. However, even by that point, things were starting to change. People wanted to use external files that weren't part of Apple's ecosystem and needed to have things organized.
    Currently, iPhones and iPads are beginning to replace traditional computers for people. They contain chips powerful enough to give entertainment experiences equivalent to what dedicated game consoles are capable of providing. There are apps for things that go far beyond anything Apple could have imagined when they created iOS. As far as I know, there has never been any sort of complete rewrite of iOS from scratch. However, the file storage software and technology has gone through at least one major recalibration, which resulted in far greater efficiency. The interface used to manage your data has been built continuously upon what has come before as the need arose. We will explore this edifice as it now stands, roughly in the order of construction. This way, when things seem a little clunky, you'll at least have a handle on why that is. Keep in mind that Apple is cautiously walking down a path of increased openness from a very closed and restrictive starting point.
Solid-State Drives:
Each iOS device comes equipped with a built-in solid-state drive. You choose its capacity at the time of purchase from a limited number of options. This constitutes the fixed amount of your device's internal storage. You cannot change this amount once you have purchased your device. The available capacity options have increased in size over the years as people have begun using these devices more like portable computers rather than consumer entertainment devices or glorified phones. Solid-state drives are very speedy and durable. However, they are still somewhat expensive in terms of storage capacity relative to hard drives. The underlying assumption of these devices is that you can keep what you really need stored ready for use in the solid-state drive whether you're online or disconnected. The rest of what you might need occasionally can be stored safely in Apple's iCloud service or other online repositories, where items can be retrieved when needed. This works quite well as long as you're connected to Wi-Fi or have cellular service available. Such connectivity through Wi-Fi or cellular data is becoming inexpensive and ubiquitous enough to make this quite workable for a growing number of people. Libraries, restaurants, and other public places are increasingly offering free or low-cost Wi-Fi. Furthermore, special cellular data plans and Internet packages are being offered for people with low incomes. There are also many third-party cloud services offering affordable storage space in addition to what Apple's iCloud Plus service makes available.
    Data is stored on your device in such a way that you don't really have to deal with folders or picking areas to store things. Everything has its place, and each app knows precisely where its data is. Anything you download must be associated with an app that will make use of it. You can't just stick stuff in the digital equivalent of a bin, like you could with a Windows PC. Apps that let you create or use files would have facilities within them to let you manage or sort them. For instance, the Audible app has a library of books you've downloaded onto your device. You can sort these books, search for the one you want, and delete books individually from your device when you no longer want them taking up space. If you need them again, you can always download the book onto your device. The same goes for any files like books or music that you obtain from Apple's services. Everything has its proper place.
    If you need to go beyond file management within individual apps, the iPhone Storage section of settings is where you should go. This is found in the General subsection of Settings. Here, you can gain an overall picture of what you actually have on your device. Information is stored categorically, with each app being its own category. There are also areas for music, photos, mail, contacts, and more kinds of data not tied to a single app. Nothing is left just lying around unattached to anything.
    Each app title or category of data is named. As you flick right or left through the apps and categories, you'll hear the name read out, as well as the amount of storage being used. Double tap on a name to go inside its section. Flick right to go through the possible options, double tapping on one if you want to implement it. Currently, you can delete an app along with its data if you no longer want it. You can also delete the app, but leave its data on your device. This can be good if an app takes up a lot of space, but the data doesn't. The icon for the deleted app will remain on your home screen. Double tapping it would download the app back onto your device, where the data still resides. It would then be ready to use. If you delete an app as well as its data, you may still always download the app from the app store and begin using it as if you had just obtained the app for the first time. Keep in mind that any data that app used that wasn't stored on your device or in iCloud will still be available. For instance, if you delete the Audible app, you don't lose your ability to access all of your books. You can reinstall the app, enter your login information and access your library of audiobooks. This is also true of any data you store in third-party cloud services. Provided you know your credentials, you can access any information stored on Dropbox, Google Drive, Amazon Cloud service, or other similar services.
    For larger categories like photos or music, you can go into them by double tapping their name and then flicking right through what resides on your device. For instance, you can delete albums and songs from music individually, rather than getting rid of every single song on your device. This is only possible for offerings from Apple services. You cannot choose which Audible or Kindle books are deleted from within the iPhone Storage area of Settings. That data is treated as one inseparable amount connected firmly to its parent app.
    When managing storage, you will typically do so from within apps themselves. For example, over time, one's music library can become huge. As of mid March 2022, mine currently comprises over 69 gigabytes of a total 512 gigabytes I have available on my iPhone 13. This music can be managed best from within the Music app. You can easily remove albums, artists, and songs from your device, but keep them in your library to be retrieved when desired. I wouldn't even venture to guess how many gigabytes all the music I've added to my personal online library would take up. Very likely, it would exceed 500 gigabytes. This is especially true now that it's available to me in extremely high quality lossless audio formats, which take up a lot of storage space. I would never want that much on my device at a time. Rather, I like to have a small subset of that downloaded and ready on my device.
The iCloud:
The iCloud is an online repository of data where you are given space to store information. If you wish, you can pay for additional storage space above what is initially allocated. Each owner of an Apple account starts with a minimum of 5 gigabytes of iCloud space. If you accidentally delete something or a catastrophic event happens to your device, you can restore things like contacts, books, and other data that has been stored in your iCloud space. This space is tied to your Apple account and password rather than to a specific device. When my father broke his original iPad, the photo he took just before its fall was transmitted to his iCloud space. When Apple gave him a new iPad, he recovered it and other information from iCloud.
    Everything you purchase from the app store, iTunes, or iBooks can be deleted and re-downloaded as often as you wish provided you're able to access the Internet via Wi-Fi or cellular data. This isn't counted against your personal iCloud space. Only personal documents, data from apps you choose, and other personal data like photos count against your space and are actually stored in iCloud. My 10 gigabytes of music purchased from iTunes is not stored in the iCloud. Instead, a record is kept of each song I purchased. I can pair down the songs stored on my iPhone to my current absolute favourites if I find I need more space for other things on my iPhone. However, I have decided to allow my library of books from an app called Voice Dream Reader to be stored there. Often, as with the Voice Dream Reader app, settings found within the app allow you to control where things related to it are stored. Should something happen to my iPhone, I will be able to restore that library of books I've purchased onto my new iPhone without difficulty. It should happen automatically when I upgrade to a new iPhone. If I wish, I can also sync this library with any other iOS devices I may have the Voice Dream Reader app running on.
    The primary use of iCloud is for backing up the important personal contents of your device. By default, information is backed up overnight when your device is plugged in, connected to Wi-Fi, and the screen is locked. In theory, this won't incur any surprise data charges or inconvenience the average user in any way. The presumptions are that your device will be left plugged in overnight and that the screen will be locked. If this isn't the case, as can happen while travelling or when unconnected to Wi-Fi, backups will not occur automatically until the next time the above ideal circumstances are met. It is possible to force a backup to occur even when on cellular data or when you have Wi-Fi connectivity available. It is also possible to exercise control over what applications have their data included in these backups and may make use of your iCloud storage. You can do all of this from inside the Settings app. Inside Settings, double tap on the "iCloud" option. . You are now in the iCloud area, where you exercise control over this aspect of storage.
    Flicking right through all the options may seem daunting. However, there's really nothing overly complicated here. You will see the amount of storage you have in the Cloud. Next to this is a Manage iCloud Storage button. This can be used to pay for additional storage or downgrade should your needs change over time. You can also delete the contents that apps store in the Cloud, as well as backups you may no longer need. Just be aware that this can't be undone, so be careful here. If instead of hitting the Manage iCloud Storage button, you choose to flick right, you will find a heading called Apps Using iCloud and a long list of toggle buttons. Double tapping these changes their state between on and off. An on position indicates that the app will use iCloud to store data. An off means that this won't occur, and any data present will be removed from the Cloud. Be careful with these toggles. If it doesn't say "button" after the name and status, it's a toggle and one double tap will change its state. Make certain you want to take the action before double tapping these. As you acquire more apps, this list will grow longer, as each app that can make use of the Cloud will have its own toggle.
How to Manually Initiate An iCloud Backup:
To force an iCloud backup to occur at the time of your own choosing:
1. Go into Settings and double tap on the iCloud button.
2. Flick right until you come to the list of apps using iCloud. Flick right until you reach the iCloud Backup button and double tap this.
3. Flick right until you reach a button called Backup Now and double tap this. The process will now begin, and you must wait until it has finished. Flick left and right over the area to check on how the backup is progressing.
The iCloud Drive and Files App:
As more apps were developed that dealt with different kinds of files, Apple introduced the iCloud Drive. This allowed apps or users to create folders where files could be stored in the Cloud. These files weren't simply part of regular compressed backups. Rather, apps could make use of these files, grabbing them from the iCloud Drive as needed. Files could also be copied or downloaded to the iCloud Drive if users desired, allowing for a much more versatile use of the portion of one's iCloud storage space not needed for backups. This makes it far more attractive for users to pay for extra storage space. The most frequently used files would also be stored on the user's iOS device so that they would be more rapidly responsive when used. There in fact used to be an iCloud Drive app to help manage this content. It has now been superseded by the Files app introduced in iOS 11.
    iOS and Android have been on opposite journeys of discovery and change. Android started out as open as possible, and has learned over time that this comes at various costs in efficiency and security. Meanwhile, Apple wanted a closed system, custom designed to work with its own hardware and software. The total control this gave them would let them create the best and safest user experience possible. And then real life happened, proving that neither path was, in fact, ideal. By the time iOS 11 was being created, things were changing in terms of how people wanted to use their iPhones and iPads. People were less satisfied with the more restricted, compartmentalized nature of how files were stored and what files could be used. App developers were making apps that let people make use of their devices to do increasingly more things, and devices were becoming more viable, more portable alternatives to traditional laptops. Apple needed to open up what could be done without utterly wrecking their highly valued security.
    The Files app eliminates a lot of the annoyances people had with how things were done before. The iCloud service is far more useful, thanks to the Files app, letting people create folders and organize files.
    The Files app acts much like the "Explorer" function in Windows. It allows you to create folders, organize and tag files, and copy, move, and share them. As of iOS 13, it can now compress and decompress files into zipped archives. This formerly required a third-party app to accomplish.
    The main view is divided up into level one locations. Level one means that these locations are like branches on a tree trunk. The higher the level number, the farther out on branches you are. It is possible to create folders within folders. The level one locations are pretty self-explanatory such as On My iPhone, iCloud Drive, Favourites, Tags, etc. You can also incorporate third-party Cloud services such as Google Drive and Dropbox into this series of locations. Once this has been done, files can be moved from one cloud to another or onto your iOS device to be put to use.
    The Files app allows for quick viewing of some file types. However, to do much with any file, it must be on your device, and you should have whatever app that can act on the file installed on your device. Most often, you would use the Share action on a file to open a file into an app that can make use of it. Alternatively, When you're in an app like Voice Dream Reader and want to retrieve a file from the Cloud, it will open an instance of the Files app, allowing you to browse and retrieve files that you then double tap on to open in Voice Dream Reader. After you're finished, hitting the Done button that appears near the top left will close that instance of the Files browser, and you'll be back in the app you were using.
Files App Layout
The layout of this app is very simple. At the top, there is an Edit button and a Search field. The Edit button puts you in a mode where you can activate or deactivate locations accessed by the Files app. For instance, you might use the Dropbox service and want to access those files using the Files app. Each location has a toggle you can turn from on to off. Also, it is possible to reorder the locations to better fit your needs. There is a Done button at the top for when you're finished editing.
    You will find Expanded or Collapsed buttons for Locations, Favourites, and Tags. Below these at the very bottom of the app screen are two tabs. These are Recent and Browse. Most likely, you will be in the Browse tab. The Recent tab confines itself to recently used files. The rotor is your friend here, letting you move quickly up or down to the start of the Favourites and Tags areas, since these are also headings as well as buttons. Double tapping on these will cause those lists to expand or collapse. This is handy as you jump over whatever is contained in that section. For instance, you may have many Favourite items. Flicking down to the next heading would quickly get you to tags. Once at the correct heading, double tap on it to expand or collapse the contents.
    Double tapping moves your focus into a location. For example, double tapping on iCloud Drive moves the focus so that the files and folders on the iCloud Drive are displayed. In the top-left corner, you'll find a Back button that moves you back onto the initial screen of locations. Double tapping on a folder name will move focus into that folder. Flick right to go through the contents of a folder. Remember that if you move onto a filename, the rotor will turn to the Actions setting, as the rotor helps you do things to files.
    To the right of the Search field near the top, you'll find a New Folder button that lets you create a folder. You will also find Sort and View options. I have my files sorted by date and in list view. There is also a Select button that lets you select files or folders for mass operations. Once files or folders have been selected, other options will appear near the bottom right, letting you Move, Delete, Copy, etc.
Tags:
Tags are a kind of alternative to folders. You might want to tag a number of files with the Home or Work tag. Double tapping on a tag will show you any files marked with the tag, regardless of where they are. Apple has provided a number of tags including different colour names as well as Work and Home tags. You can add more if you wish. Subsequently, one of the actions available when you're on a file is to tag it.
    Once a file is tagged, going down to the Tags area and double tapping on that tag will focus on a list of files that have that tag attached to them. It won't matter which folder they're stored in. They'll all appear in that list. You might, therefore, have everything from documents to spreadsheets tagged as Work, and they'd all appear when you double tapped on the Work tag.
Adding and Removing Level One Locations
The Edit button discussed earlier lets you enter a mode where it is possible to act on those level one locations. You will find switches letting you turn things like iCloud Drive or Dropbox on or off. There is also a button for adding other third-party Cloud services. When required, you will be asked for any credentials needed to allow access to third-party Cloud services. You can also access other storage media such as flash drives, SD cards, or external servers provided you have any adaptors or other hardware required. You should then, in theory, be able to deal with all available files within the Files app itself. Each storage source is treated like another level one folder.
Interacting with Individual Files:
Once you've flicked onto a file you want to move or do something else with, the rotor will have turned itself to actions. You then need to flick up or down to go through all the available Actions and double tap on the one you want. You may find even more actions available if you perform a one-finger triple tap on a file. Let's say you have a recording of a lecture. You don't need it right away, but should keep it around for study before tests or exams. You downloaded the MP3 containing the lecture to the Files app. You will find it on the iCloud Drive in the root directory. Perhaps, you have created a folder on the iCloud Drive to store such lecture files in the future and want to move this file into the Lectures folder. Flick right through the list of what's in your root iCloud Drive folder until you come to the lecture file. The rotor will have set itself to actions. Therefore, flick down or upwards through the available Actions until you come to drag. In this case, it's quicker to flick upwards to reach it. Double tap on the Drag option to pick up the lecture file. Next, flick left through the list until you come to the lectures folder you created. Flicking upwards will prove faster to reach the Drop onto Item option. Double tap this to add the file to your folder. If you have set Sorting to Manual, you will be able to drop files and folders in whatever order you wish.
The HomeKit;
Interacting With Smart Appliances in Your Home:
    The HomeKit acts as a control console and hub for smart appliances. For instance, you might have a smart thermostat, allowing you to precisely and easily control the temperature. Smart lighting can be checked and turned on or off using your iOS device. This could be useful to blind people who often forget, as we occasionally do, to check that lights that aren't needed have been turned off. Such control can be absolutely vital for people with physical disabilities and dramatically increase their sense of independence. I certainly wouldn't object to a stove or laundry machines that allowed such accessible monitoring and control.
    In a brief look at a site that popped up when I double tapped on a button called Learn About Home Accessories, I was presented with a wide range of "smart" devices. Everything from lights to doorbells to locks to air purifiers. The range is enormous now and growing constantly.
    There are two tabs in the Home app. The first is called Home. This tab lets you control appliances in your "home" or other "homes" where you've been given permission to. Presumably, where appliances are present and detectable, you will be able to interface with them.
    The other tab is called Automations and allows you to set up sequences of events that can happen automatically or at your command. For instance, perhaps, you want the door to unlock, the curtains to open, and the lights to turn on when you arrive home. This sort of thing is quite possible and, from what I've heard, accessible and easy using the Home app and compatible accessories.
    In a one-bedroom apartment such as ours, these sorts of things would perhaps be possible, but seem quite unnecessary. I can get up and walk the few steps over to the light switch and use it. Marking the stove with tactile bumps might not be quite as precise, but works well enough for us. Perhaps, over time, smart appliances will become so standard that we'll find them being put in rental apartments. If that's the case, everything I've heard suggests that once your iOS device has been paired with them, taking control of the appliances should be relatively simple.
The Grand Design:
Overall, iOS has been designed to make things as efficient, safe, and simple as possible while using a touchscreen. This philosophy and flexibility extends to how you manage your data storage space to when and how alerts and notifications are displayed. Things are very intuitive for people who can see. Blind people need to piece together an overall sense of layout as they feel their way around what was designed to be taken in at a glance. Once you've learned the basic conventions of where things are, that intuitive sense will really start to kick in as you explore more apps.
    A lot of options are compartmented inside various apps. A staggering amount of your ability to configure how an iOS device behaves is found within the Settings app. I have devoted an entire section of this guide to help you make the most of this important operational centre. Generally, though, there is information about aspects of iOS scattered throughout this guide. From the way dialogues and interface elements appear to how external devices like Bluetooth speakers are controlled, iOS is integral to it all. Its presence is felt in how apps work and how settings can change their behaviour. It is felt in how you can adjust settings to suit your particular abilities and needs, open an app, and have these settings simply work. For instance, apps that support the Large Type accessibility feature will simply enact it if it has been set to "on" by the user. Once Audio Description is set to "on", apps such as Apple TV or Netflix will often simply play the audio description track if it's available.
    For purposes of simplicity, this guide presumes that you are running iOS 18 or later. Each new version of iOS incorporates changes that affect how you accomplish things or what is actually possible to do. This is a fairly iterative and gradual process, so most of this guide will still be relevant for people using earlier versions or a few versions later. Keep in mind, however, that drastic changes typically occur in small areas improving upon ease of accomplishment or capability. Should you be using a device running an earlier or later version, be aware that, occasionally, information I cover or methods of doing things simply won't apply to your situation. Many apps won't work unless you update to a more recent version of iOS. There are also occasions where apps will be unavailable for later versions of iOS because developers don't keep them updated. Despite the potential for this, I strongly recommend upgrading to a more modern iOS version whenever possible. If your device can no longer receive iOS updates, I would strongly encourage you to upgrade to a more modern iOS device that can receive updates. Barring very unusual circumstances, the benefits of such updates far outweigh any losses. For the most part, app developers give their users some notice before stopping support for their apps. However, nothing mandates this.
    In general, Apple makes certain that each new version supports older devices from at least four or five generations back. Recently, they put quite a bit of work into extending the longevity of older iOS devices. Now that Apple has incorporated public testing and is likely to resolve major issues before the release of an update, it will be safer to grab a new iOS update as soon as you can. However, it won't hurt to wait and see if people on AppleVis or other forums discussing accessibility issues find any problems. These updates are always free of charge, other than any data charges you might incur for downloading the update.
    Over the years, Apple has increasingly been willing to announce features which would only be ready for deployment later in the cycle of updates for that major version of iOS. You would hear about the Journal app, for instance, but it wouldn't be ready for months after the introduction of that year's version of iOS. This has made it harder to have editions of this book ready before the cycle was completed and the next version of iOS would be released. Sometimes, as with iOS 18, features advertised as being a part of that year's iOs simply wouldn't be ready at all. For all of its stellar added features, iOS 18 won't contain much of what was promised regarding Apple Intelligence. The most exciting features, which would offer tremendous improvements to Siri, won't appear until later in the cycle of updates for iOS 19 according to current rumours. This has been easily the worst public relations disaster which Apple has ever suffered for promising more than they could deliver in timely fashion.
    Even for people who don't require accessibility features, it hasn't always proved a safe assumption that things will work better than before with each new update to iOS. iOS 13 sadly provides a perfect example of this, which I fervently hope we'll never see the like of again. In a nutshell, when a blind user of VoiceOver ended a call or audio chat, he or she was quite likely to suddenly find that VoiceOver had stopped working. No sound would come out of their devices, leaving them basically helpless. It isn't hard to think of situations where this could lead to serious trouble or even danger, particularly for inexperienced users with no sighted help ready to hand. This is far from a minor annoyance to be fixed a few weeks later when it's convenient. People who spend money on these devices pay a premium for the care and attention to detail Apple has become known for. They shouldn't have to worry that answering a simple phone call would likely render their device absolutely useless to them unless they know how to recover VoiceOver functionality. Unfortunately, this kind of thing continues to make its way into public circulation.
    Naturally, I wondered whether testers had reported this to the Apple Accessibility Department as the urgent, major problem that it was. I happened to participate in a talk about iOS 13 for blind people along with a blind tester and asked about this. Apparently, this issue never manifested itself during the extensive developer and public testing cycle. They hadn't encountered it and so never reported it. Clearly, then, something changed between when the testing stopped and when the final public release emerged. We aren't dealing with a conscious decision to ignore or devalue the experiences of blind users. Rather, we're dealing with a process that is so very complex as to defy understanding, where the left hand doesn't always know what the right is doing.
    Let's face it. Had a similar sort of bug caused the iPhones of sighted users to freeze up and go pitch black upon the end of a phone call, the problem would likely never have gotten out the door. Apple would have resolved the issue before releasing the version of iOS to the public. At worst, it would have been fixed rapidly, perhaps a week later at the longest.
    Thankfully, this bug has long since been fixed by the time you read these words. However, it remained unresolved for over two months, during which time at least five quickly released updates appeared that fixed other non-accessibility related issues. Of course, each of those releases came with the dashed hope of such serious accessibility concerns being addressed. The difficulties that the earlier releases fixed were either deemed more urgent and widely troublesome, or, far more likely in my opinion, simply proved easier to reliably replicate and remedy, making finding how to fix them easier. Thankfully, as of iOS, 13.3 that appeared in early December 2019, we had arrived where we should have been before iOS 13 was released to the public at all. It was by no means perfect, but was at a point where I felt safe recommending that even new users update to iOS 13 rather than sticking with the latest update to iOS 12. Needing accessibility features to make good use of an iOS device unfortunately seems to increase the risk notably that an iOS update could actually prove detrimental to your experience. This risk is highest with a major release and drops with subsequent releases as more bugs are dealt with.
    Given the rough entry of iOS 13, Apple has again taken steps to try to prevent such lapses in software quality in future releases. More safety checks have been incorporated to make certain that changes made in one area don't break things in another. This should lessen the chances of major problems slipping past both internal and public testing before new versions being released. Given the maturity of the hardware and the longer times people are keeping their devices, I believe things will improve in terms of not having catastrophic bugs emerge to frustrate people who didn't sign up for dealing with such surprises. Providers of the content offered by Apple's increasing number of subscription services will demand greater stability, and all the focus won't be concentrated on the latest hardware. It will increasingly simply be a delivery vehicle for the services, which will become the star attractions.
    I hope that Apple will take better care to hold things back until they are properly ready to be revealed. A great many people have been disappointed after spending money on new iPhones specially built for Apple Intelligence features which were sorely needed but simply not ready. For a fraction of the cost of a new iPhone, they could have gotten superior results simply subscribing to the AI services and using apps offered by Google and Open AI.
    Over time, Apple has started with a very closed ecosystem and slowly begun to open sections up to third-party developers. This has resulted in increased safety and simplicity at the cost of overall choice. One key advantage is that accessibility tools are built into the operating system. If developers choose to make their apps accessible, they do not have to contend with as many variable circumstances as developers for the Android operating system. There are many apps that are accessible quite by accident because they use standard controls and interface elements created by Apple. Apple takes many steps to strongly encourage developers to make their apps accessible to blind people as well as those with other disabilities. This includes building tools like VoiceOver into their operating system, offering workshops and documentation to teach developers about accessibility options, and much more.
    I hope this gives you a good grasp of iOS and lets you explore your iOS device with a healthy degree of confidence. Presuming you've read the previous section that covered VoiceOver, you should now be able to begin taking charge of your device, making choices about how it behaves without any fear. Subsequent sections will be there to help you branch out from what comes preinstalled on your device and truly enter the online world in comfort and your own style.

Configure Your iPhone with Settings:
Before we get started, be aware that Apple has drastically reorganized settings in iOS 18. Readers of previous editions would do well to go through this section if they can't find particular settings they require. No previously available settings have been removed by Apple. They're just in different places.
    The whole premise behind the design of iOS devices is that they're delightful to use for everyone. In order for this to be possible, it follows that each of us should be able to customize its behaviour to suit our unique preferences. We all live in different places, access different networks, speak different languages and need to accomplish different things with our individual capabilities. Small wonder then that there are so many settings. Try not to be daunted as you explore this critical area in your iOS device. I'll give you the tools to more quickly find what you need in this section of the guide.
    After getting my iPHONE, one of the first things I had to do was to make use of the Settings app. I had to connect my iPhone to my home Wi-Fi and make certain I had the latest iOS version. I also wanted to have a good look around and get a sense of what kinds of things I could change about how my iPhone behaved. Everything was blessedly simple. Before long, I had entirely changed how VoiceOver spoke, selecting a different voice and speech rate. I had turned down the brightness of my screen to 0%, saving all kinds of battery power. After some experimentation, I found the typing mode that best suited me. Finding the Sounds area of Settings, I selected a ringtone and event sounds that I preferred over the default ones. Slowly, as I made more choices, this strange new rectangular slab began to feel more like something I truly owned.
    I hear a good many complaints from people who feel that iOS won't let them do what they want. Whenever I've probed deeper, I usually find that what they want is perfectly possible. They just didn't know where to find the choice they were after. Chances are that the choice they were unaware of was in the Settings area of iOS. It really pays to invest time in getting to know the many choices presented through this application. Are you being distracted by notifications while trying to work or navigate via GPS? The Notifications area of Settings lets you choose which apps can generate notifications in the first place. You can also exercise a lot of control over whether apps can interrupt you with information, or silently add their information to the Notification Centre for later retrieval at your convenience. All options regarding how VoiceOver behaves are found in the Settings app. Storage management, security settings, connectivity choices, and many more choices affecting how your iOS device works are also found in Settings. You'll want to drop in often as your situation changes. No decisions you make in Settings are ever set in stone. You can always change settings and adapt your device to current circumstances and changing preferences.
    Generally speaking, you should think mainly in terms of global changes of behaviour you wish to implement. While many apps have settings unique to their operation, you'll most often go into Settings when you want to make macroscopic changes that apply throughout iOS regardless of which app you might be using. For example, you may want to use UK English and spelling rather than US. Perhaps, you would like to turn off the autocorrect or spellcheck capabilities because you never make typing mistakes. Maybe, you need to free up a large amount of storage space in a hurry. For small, quick, less drastic changes, there are usually ways to do what you want while inside the app you're using.
    There are so many options that if I tried to cover all of them, I would doubtless fail and overlook some. Rather than doing this, I'll leave that to the user guide Apple has already created for your iOS device. You can use Apple Books to read it, or find it in accessible form on the Apple accessibility site. Instead, I'll explain in detail how to get around in Settings, so you have a good idea where you'll find what you're after. Rather than explaining each and every setting, I'll focus on the more crucial ones that have been instrumental in my experience. Moreover, whenever it makes more sense, I'll cover settings in other sections and simply refer you to them as appropriate. A good example of this is when discussing settings related to privacy and security. These settings are covered in the section called Privacy and Security. It seems far more sensible to cover security aspects all in their own special section. Another example is the "Focus" settings introduced in iOS 15. There is a complete discussion of focus modes, controls and focus settings area in a separate section. I'm in Settings all the time as my circumstances change, or just to keep an ear on how much storage space I'm using. I have the Settings icon in my dock, so it's always handy.
    Think of the Settings app as a kind of tree. There is a long trunk with major branches spaced out along it. The trunk and branches can be navigated like straight lines with left or right flicks using one finger to go to each branch or leaf. Three-finger swipes upward to advance or downward to scroll up towards the top can be used to skip through settings faster.
    Double tapping with one finger on a setting or area of Settings will cause you to either change the setting if it's a toggle, or else enter the branch of related settings. Double tapping on Settings within a branch might lead to more branches and specific-related settings off the preceding level of specificity. For example, the General branch contains settings effecting the behaviour of your iOS device. The Accessibility branch contains an impressive array of options to make iOS devices useable by people with disabilities. The Storage branch found in the General area allows you to view and manage how much capacity you are currently using on your device.
    Before iOS 18, all these options were spread out in what could seem to be a daunting endless line of choices to make. Apple has now taken steps to rectify this. The largest change was having all the settings directly related to apps on your iPhone moved into a large alphabetically sorted expandable bucket. Splitting these settings from the rest has resulted in a far less cluttered and shorter trunk. Nothing separates settings related to Apple related apps from other third-party ones. The area will grow larger as you acquire more apps. However, the settings in the "apps" area are always in alphabetical order and there are ways to quickly navigate. This new arrangement should make exploring the settings on your iPhone much easier.
    Thankfully, building a mental map of the Settings area isn't that hard due to how it's all organized. Once you understand the pattern and what the key landmarks are, you can skip quickly back or forward, land on a particular setting, and know how to quickly get to what you want by flicking left or right. You'll soon come to appreciate the thought that went into making things intuitive and simple. As we explore the settings, I'll label stretches of them which relate to each other thematically. This will make it easier for you to build that mental map.
    Siri can also get you quickly to settings of interest. Invoke Siri and say "show VoiceOver settings". While it can get you to settings fairly specifically, it can't always control them. You can tell Siri to turn VoiceOver on or off, but can't tell it to connect to a Wi-Fi network. You'd have to tell Siri "show Wi-Fi settings" and then use the touchscreen and VoiceOver to attend to connecting to the network yourself. Furthermore, you can't do things with Siri like turning VoiceOver Hints on or off or setting the speaking rate. Remember that Siri is meant to be a personal assistant. It was never designed to let people do absolutely everything by speaking to their iOS devices. For that, you could use the Voice Control feature added in iOS 13.
    Once you're in a branch or subsection of Settings, you'll always find a Back button located in the top-left corner of the screen below the status bar. This lets you exit that branch and move back towards or onto the main trunk. For instance, VoiceOver settings are two levels deep. Level one, accessibility. Level two, VoiceOver. Using the Back button while in VoiceOver settings returns you to Accessibility settings. If you do a one finger triple tap on the "back" button, a context menu will appear containing the option to go back to the root level. Very handy if you're multiple levels deep into a branch.
    Within branches of settings, things are often divided by headings. This speeds up navigation once you turn the rotor to Headings. Flicking up or down with one finger will move you to the next or previous heading if any headings are present. For instance, headings within the Accessibility settings include: Vision, Interaction, Hearing, Media, and Learning. Once you reach a desired heading, flick right to go to options related to the heading. The first option under Vision is VoiceOver. Double tapping on this will bring you into VoiceOver settings.
    It can be worth your while to explore the settings screens, feeling around with your finger to get a sense of where things are, rather than flicking left and right to reach everything. If your muscle memory is good enough, you will increasingly be able to touch near where a particular setting is, which can speed up making desired changes. The number of settings that will fit in a row and in a screen's worth of settings will differ depending on the size of your device.
Types of Setting Controls
Some settings are toggles while others are branches. If a setting is a branch, it will always say "button" after the name of the setting and status information. For example, flicking right onto the VoiceOver button, you'll hear VoiceOver on Button. Double tapping on this brings you to VoiceOver settings. The first button you come to within VoiceOver settings will say VoiceOver On. After a short pause, presuming Hints are enabled, you'll hear "double-tap to toggle setting". If you double tapped this button, you would shut off VoiceOver. Airplane mode is the first option in the main trunk of Settings and is also a toggle. Double tapping it instantly activates or deactivates Airplane mode. This mode instantly turns off all transmissions from your iOS device such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, making it safe to use on airplanes.
    Among the various settings, you will also find sliders. You can change the value these are set to by flicking up or down with a finger while you're on them. Brightness and volume settings are examples of sliders. These sliders don't rap around. If, for instance, you set brightness to 0% and then flick downward again, you won't find that brightness jumps to 100%. Now that you can get around, we'll examine key areas in each of our groupings in greater detail. Remember that when it seems sensible, some settings are discussed elsewhere. Most notably, VoiceOver settings are discussed in the section about VoiceOver rather than in this one.
Your Personal Space:
Apple Account, iCloud, and More
    The very first thing you come to after double tapping on the Settings app is a Search field. This may come in handy as more settings are added to this area as you acquire more apps. The next thing is a button labelled with your name. Double tapping on this button takes you into what I think of as your personal locker area. This area is where you manage anything related to your Apple account, iCloud storage, and personal information.
    Your Apple account is your key to the kingdom. This area lets you decide on things like whether you want extra iCloud storage space or how you want to pay Apple for services, books, movies, etc. Typically, you will have created an Apple account during the setup process. This is where you can set up a credit card to be used with Apple, where any expenses incurred can be charged. You can also manage any subscriptions to services or apps. One thing I strongly recommend you do here is set up the Find My feature. This will let you locate lost devices such as a misplaced AirPod. If you ever lose your iPHONE, this feature will be helpful in locating it.
    Keep in mind here that this is not where you manage your Touch or Face ID or your device's passcode needed for unlocking. The Password & Security settings in here have to do with your Apple account, which isn't tied to a specific device. It is because of this separation that when you upgrade to a new device, all of your digital belongings such as apps you've purchased come along with you.
A Mental Map of Thematic Groupings:
Gradually, as I used settings more often, I realized that they were organized thematically. Nothing denotes the groupings I'll outline for you below. However, once you realize you're in one of these groupings, you will have a sense of how far to move in order to get where you want to go. There are five general groupings I have noticed which seem to remain relatively stable over iOS updates. New settings are added and others may move, but the basic arrangement seems pretty fixed at this point.
    Connectivity settings at start after Apple account and family. Stops at personal hotspot.
    Control settings start with battery and end with wallpaper.
    Awareness settings start with notifications and end with focus.
    Security settings start with screen time and end with privacy and security.
    Apple settings start with app store and end with wallet and Apple Pay.
    Apps button leads to bucket of all app settings alphabetical.
    The connectivity grouping comes first. It starts with the toggle for airplane mode and ends with the personal hotspot option, presuming you have cellular connectivity set up. These settings all have to do with how and when your device communicates with networks, services, and other devices.
    The configuration grouping comes next. It starts with the battery button and ends with the wallpaper button. This area has a lot of critical settings and includes such things as accessibility, general settings and display settings. 
    The awareness grouping is next. It currently consists of three options. These include notifications settings, sound and haptics settings, and focus settings. These settings allow you to decide what your device informs you of. Just as importantly, you can also determine when you don't wish to be disturbed by communications or information provided via notifications from apps, which may check for new data in the background while you're doing other things.
    The security grouping begins with the screen time settings button. It extends through to the privacy and security settings button. This is where you manage the security of your device and make options concerning privacy of information.
    The Apple grouping Currently contains four settings. These include app store settings, game centre settings, iCloud settings, and lastly, the wallet and Apple Pay settings. All of these settings deal with apps or services provided directly by Apple.
    At the end of the Settings tree, you'll find an "apps" button. Every app on your device will have an entry in this group. They are arranged in alphabetical order. No distinction is made between apps created by Apple and those created by other developers. This group will grow over time as you acquire more apps. Look in these settings if an app doesn't include options you want inside itself. Often, you will find additional settings for apps listed here.
The Communications Grouping
The first setting in this grouping is the toggle setting called Airplane Mode. This lets you quickly shut off all Wi-Fi, cellular, and Bluetooth communications that might interfere with flight operations while on an airplane. Next are a group of four branches letting you control communication methods which your device uses, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular data. Think of the Airplane mode toggle plus the four following branches as the communications grouping. It ends with the Personal Hotspot branch.
    Your device derives all of its real value from its ability to communicate. It does this through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and, presuming you've purchased a device with the capability, through cellular data. Each of these methods is useful. Many of us will be familiar with the basics of Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and cellular communications as they have been around long before the advent of iPhones. However, I'm aware that for some of my readers, this may be your first experience with a device that employs these methods. For those who may be unfamiliar with these terms, I will explain what each of these communication methods is used for. I'm an English major, not a technocrat or computer scientist. I have a very basic non-technical grasp of these things. Once you're on the Internet, those who have an interest can easily find more in-depth explanations than what I'll provide over a few paragraphs here. Those who already understand these methods should skip ahead to the next third-level heading, where I'll describe each branch of the communication grouping in detail.
    The term Wi-Fi is used widely to refer to a method of connecting to the internet without wires. A central device called a "router" is hooked up directly to the Internet using a wired connection. This router can broadcast and receive signals, allowing other devices to be able to access the internet without needing a direct wired connection. The router my wife and I used in our apartment was provided by our Internet service provider. It takes up a small portion of my desk space and is around 15 or 20 centimetres tall. This router lets me connect my iPhone or iPad to the Internet, no matter where they are in my apartment. I might be sitting on the couch, washing dishes in the kitchen, relaxing on our balcony, or working in the bedroom to escape noise in the main room. I could even potentially be outside my apartment in the hallway or perhaps on a neighbour's balcony. Wi-Fi routers can be powerful enough to allow for continuous connectivity through walls and even floors. For larger areas, Wi-Fi signal strength can be boosted using devices placed close enough to the router to broadcast its signals farther. Wi-Fi connections are typically found inside houses, hotels, libraries, and other buildings for use by people inside or near these structures.
    While there may be a limit to how much bandwidth or data is available via Wi-Fi depending on one's service provider and chosen plan, people generally treat Wi-Fi like an unlimited resource. This is because it is typically less expensive than cellular data. We tend to think of it much like we consider water in our homes. We're less mindful of how much we use, since people typically subscribe to plans that have a lot of data available. We download movies, stream broadcasts, load books onto our devices and so forth without really thinking about how much data we use. If you intend to do a lot of heavy uploading or downloading, Wi-Fi is what you would likely prefer to use due to speed and cost.
    Bluetooth communication is normally used for short-range communication between devices rather than for Internet connectivity. I am currently typing this on a physical keyboard connected via Bluetooth to my iPhone. I'm hearing the results of my work using AirPods (which are earbuds) that are also connected via Bluetooth. This lets me get up and move freely without worry about snagging a wire on anything I may pass by.
    Cellular data is used when you're away from Wi-Fi. You might need a map of the area you're driving through. Perhaps, you want a suggestion of highly regarded restaurants in your area. Perhaps, you want to download an ebook that you forgot to put on your device while at home. You might want to check your email while waiting for a bus. All of these things and more are possible thanks to cellular data.
    If Wi-Fi is the tap providing endless water inside the home, cellular data is the bottled water you take on the road. There used to be a far more pronounced difference between the information transfer speed you could get via Wi-Fi and that which was possible over cellular networks. This difference still exists, but is far less noticeable these days. Especially with the increased availability of 5G, which stands for fifth generation, networks. Cellular data is transmitted using cell towers and satellites. Maintaining this network is costly, so the data plans tend to be more costly or have limitations. I'm on unlimited internet Wi-Fi and cellular plans. On Wi-Fi, unlimited really means unlimited with no strings attached. I need not worry about how much data I use downloading Netflix movies or audio content. I can download the entire contents of Wikipedia as many times as I like, without considering the amount of data that uses up. Meanwhile, I would never dream of doing these things on cellular data. My current "infinite" cellular plan gives me up to thirty gigabytes at the best possible speed. I got a very nice surprise bonus of an additional fifteen gb on top of what should have been only a fifteen gb per month plan by happening to upgrade my iPhone at the right time. If I use over thirty GB, I don't ever run out of data. Otherwise, they couldn't call it an unlimited plan. However, things will take far longer to accomplish, since my speed is dramatically throttled down unless I pay for more data at maximum speed. I'm therefore far more conservative with my cellular data in case I should need speedy access before my cap is renewed at the end of each month. Other cellular plans differ in speed of network and data limitations depending on where you are.
Wi-Fi Settings
Upon entering the Wi-Fi branch, you'll first find a toggle you can use to turn your device's Wi-Fi capability on or off. While turning this capability off can save power constantly required to check for available Wi-Fi networks you may want to connect to, the amount of energy saved is relatively small. If you're connected to a Wi-Fi network, you will find it listed right after the on/off toggle. Along with its name, you'll also find a report of the number of signal bars available, giving you an indication of the speed and reliability of the connection. Three bars are as good as it gets. Less than three bars either means the connection source is far away or obstructed, perhaps by walls or floors. You'll also be told whether networks are secured or unsecured. Secure networks require a password and other credentials to be allowed to use them. My own network is protected by a password that prevents any of my neighbours from making use of it without my permission. Should we have friends over to visit, I can tell them the required password or share it with their devices if they want it.
    Flicking past this network, you'll find a More Info button. As its name implies, double tapping it will take you into an area with additional information about that particular network. Most of this information will be unnecessary for the majority of users. It includes things like the IP address, subnet mask, and other items of which I have only vague understanding. However, you'll also find an Auto-Join option that you can toggle on or off. This tells your device whether to simply automatically join this network whenever you're in range. I have this enabled for my home network. You will also find an option to release and renew your connection, which may help when you're experiencing connectivity issues.
    Next, you'll find a heading called Networks. Past that point, you'll find a list of any networks detected by your device. Double tap on a network's name if you want to "join", or in other words, connect with it. You will then either simply be allowed to connect if it is an unsecured network, or prompted for the required password or other credentials if it's a secure network. After entering any needed information, simply double tap the Join button, and you should be connected provided no mistakes were made. If the attempt was unsuccessful, you will eventually be told this. However, you won't necessarily be notified if the attempt succeeds. You will simply be connected and able to use the network.
    At the far end of the Wi-Fi settings past all the networks, you'll find a few more items, one of which is a toggle that determines whether your device will automatically join known networks that you have previously connected to when possible. If no known networks are detected, you will be asked if you want to join any unknown networks detected in your area. Another toggle determines whether your device searches for and joins personal hotspots if no Wi-Fi networks are detected. We'll touch on personal hotspots later in this section.
Bluetooth Settings
The Bluetooth option takes you to where you can pair your iOS device with a wide range of accessories like keyboards, speakers, headsets, etc. You can also choose to deactivate Bluetooth when you don't need it. This can save some battery power, but the amount saved is quite negligible. I tend to use accessories quite regularly, including AirPods and Bluetooth connected keyboards, so I keep Bluetooth on.
    The first thing in the Bluetooth settings branch is an option to turn the Bluetooth capability on or off. Subsequently, you will find any Bluetooth devices you have previously connected to your iOS device. Aside from the device name, you'll also be told whether the device is currently connected. To reconnect a device, make certain that it is ready and nearby. Double tap on the device name, and your iOS device should attempt to connect. Past these devices, you'll find any devices within range that are ready to be paired with, or in other words, connected to your iOS device. Simply double tap the name of the device to initiate a pairing attempt.
    Pairing devices is reasonably simple. Things like speakers and headsets will simply connect. Typically, such devices will have easy methods to put them in pairing mode, which you should always doo before double tapping their name. For example, if I want to connect my Trekz Titaniums, I first put them in pairing mode. I then flick through the list of devices and double tap on its name. It will then pair and sound will start coming through the headset rather than the speaker built into my iOS device.
    Other accessories including keyboards and Braille displays can be a bit more of a challenge, since they often require you to enter a short number on the keyboard followed by the "enter" key. All well and good if you're familiar with the accessory and know where these buttons actually are. Somewhat more problematic if you're dealing with a keyboard whose design has been altered to save space. Braille displays should actually be paired in VoiceOver settings rather than as a standard Bluetooth device. If a PIN number is required to connect with one of those, it can be entered on the iOS device. Once a device has been paired, you shouldn't need to pair it again when you want to use it in the future. It should, in theory, pair automatically when both devices are near each other and powered. In practice, I've had to cause my iOS device to forget about a keyboard or other device when something has gone wrong with the pairing and then pair the device as if for the first time. This has happened much less often with iOS 15 than it used to in earlier versions. Reliable Bluetooth connectivity has definitely improved. The one exception would be with Braille displays. People still experience a range of connectivity and other issues with those.
    The More Info button beside each device's name takes you into a small branch containing information and choices relative to that particular connected accessory. Don't ever presume that there's only information to be found here. For one thing, there's the Forget This Device option. This can come in handy when something goes out of sync with the connection, and you need to connect a misbehaving device from scratch. Another option which was recently added lets you tell iOS what type of device something is. For instance, you could tell the system that a speaker with other capabilities should be thought of as a speaker. Depending on the accessory, there may be more options. If you have a set of AirPods, for instance, they add a number of configuration options to the More Info dialogue reached by the button beside their name.
Personal Hotspot
This option allows iPhones or iPads with cellular connectivity to share their connection to the Internet with other devices. For instance, you could use your iPhone to provide a Wi-Fi connection for your laptop if you wanted to. While on vacation, parents with data plans might allow their children to connect their devices to play a game or communicate with friends. You can create a password so that only people with your permission may use your data.
The Awareness Grouping:
Next come four branches of settings that are all about how and when your iOS device communicates information to you. I think of it as the awareness grouping. This begins with Notifications, where you can decide which apps are allowed to interrupt what you're doing to provide possibly useful or vital information. The Sounds & Haptics branch lets you customize your ringtone and other audio and physical cues delivered via taps and vibrations. The Focus area lets you turn on and schedule the Do Not Disturb focus mode, as well as configure and customize other focus modes to suit your lifestyle and habits. Focus modes and settings are discussed in a separate section of this guide. Screen Time is a feature that lets you track how much time is spent using apps. You can also limit when and how long apps can be used. This can be helpful in dealing with addiction to games and social media. It can also help limit what children can do on their devices or yours.
Notifications Settings
The Notifications branch lets you determine which applications can alert you to things that happen while you're otherwise occupied. It also lets you choose which apps can place notifications in an area called the Notification Centre for later review. To find out more, please refer to the section of this guide titled "Notifications". Before making substantive changes in this area of settings, however, I recommend you read the section of this guide called "Focus". These options work very well in tandem to help you cope better with incoming information and communications.
Sounds & Haptics
This branch lets you customize the volume level of important sounds like the phone ringer and alert sounds. Also, it lets you decide whether you want haptic feedback when system sounds play. This involves vibrations which happen when certain events occur. Don't confuse this with a similarly named branch of settings in the VoiceOver settings area. The choices here are pretty self-explanatory, so I'll let you discover them for yourself. Just be aware that it's possible to obtain additional ringtones and sounds to use for events. This section of settings is where you can choose which sound indicates what. You aren't even limited to what you can obtain via purchases from the iTunes store. There are some third-party apps and techniques which let you create your own ringtones and event sounds. Even without resorting to such options, there's quite a selection of distinct and familiar sounds available.
Focus:
These settings are discussed in their own section later in this guide.
Screen Time:
Over the years, people have begun to grow more conscious of and alarmed by how addictive their smart devices can be. As of iOS 12, Apple introduced Screen Time to help combat this. At the top of Screen Time settings, you'll find the first part of this strategy. Charts are displayed with your current overall statistics during the day. You can also get a chart of the last week to get a sense of how much time you spend on your device. Flicking past this information, you come to a wide range of options, letting you take firm control.
    The first option lets you schedule downtime away from the screen. During this time, only apps you permit or phone calls are allowed to function. You can use a passcode to override this if necessary. Once the scheduled period ends, things will return to normal functioning.
    The next option lets you set daily limits for individual apps, websites, and app categories. These categories include social media, reference, productivity, games, etc. The advantage of doing this by category is that any apps you subsequently obtain will be included in their respective categories, automatically falling under the same time limit. All limits are reset daily at midnight.
    The next option lets you set apps to be always allowed regardless of screen time limits. Each app is listed in alphabetical order. A heading called Allowed Apps is followed by a group of apps that you have selected as being allowed at all times. After these apps, you'll find a Choose Apps heading. After this heading, you'll find all apps that haven't been designated as being "always allowed". To do so, simply double tap on their name, and they will transfer into the "allowed apps" group. If you want to remove an app from Allowed Apps, simply double tap it, and it will return to its place in the larger mass of apps. By default, the Phone, Messages, FaceTime, and Maps apps are in the group that is always allowed.
    Next, you'll find a Content & Privacy Restrictions button. You'll find all the options which allow you to restrict what can happen on your device have now been move into the Screen Time section. For this reason, you'll find a more thorough discussion in the section called "Privacy and Security". The next option lets you set a special passcode for Screen Time. This can be used to get past limitations and restrictions. The passcode is a four-digit number. Once you set this up, be certain to remember it, since you'll need it should you want to turn it off or override any restrictions you set. I've heard from more than one person who wanted me to help them with a device that they restricted needlessly and then forgot the passcode. There is nothing I can do for people in such circumstances, so please don't go there.
    People with more than one iOS device can share information across devices, making the information available on other devices connected to your iCloud. The Screen Time feature can be used with Family Sharing. This lets parents have some control over what can happen on their children's devices.
    The last option in these settings lets you completely turn off the Screen Time feature. Statistics will no longer be kept and limits won't be enforced. Remember that if you don't turn on any restrictions, all that happens is that statistics are kept about how much time you spend doing various things on your iOS device. This feature won't interfere unless you instruct it to.
The Configuration Grouping:
The next large grouping of branches all has to do with configuring aspects of how your device behaves. I think of it as the configuration grouping. The group begins with the Battery branch. Next comes a critical branch called General. There, you'll find many important branches letting you control such things as Language & Region preferences, the iPhone Storage onboard your device, obtaining Software Updates, and much more. Next comes the Accessibility area. Here, you'll find all the features Apple has developed to make it possible for people with a wide range of disabilities to use their products. This area includes the settings for the VoiceOver screen reader. For newer iPhones, new additions as of iOS 18 include settings for the Action button, camera control, and a branch called Apple Intelligence and Siri. The Control Centre area lets you customize which options are available in the Control Centre and what order they are in. Display & Brightness is where you can control aspects of how the display behaves. It's also where you'll find the Auto-Lock feature for your device. This grouping ends with the "Wallpaper" branch.
Battery Settings
There are a couple of potentially useful settings here. Most importantly, there is Low Power Mode that, when activated, operates your device in a more power-conservative way. This will reduce its background activities like downloading and fetching mail. When your device is plugged in to charge, this mode will turn off automatically. The prior setting, Battery Percentage, displays your battery level as a percent rather than a visual indicator.
    The button called Battery Health is something you should double tap every once in a while. It will initiate a test of your battery to determine how much charge it is capable of holding relative to when it was new. Over time, your battery will lose overall capacity as it ages. The chemicals inside become fatigued and eventually won't be able to supply enough power at once to allow your device to operate at peak performance. After two and a half years of hard use, my battery is still capable of delivering peak performance, with its health measured at 86%. When peak performance is unsupportable by the battery, measures are taken to reduce the power needed by your device and slow its performance but protect you from unexpected shutdowns. Your device can still safely be used, but it's time to think about either replacing the battery or upgrading to a newer device.
    On more modern iPhones, the Battery Health area will also indicate when your battery was manufactured and how many charge cycles have been used. This is a good method of getting an idea of how well you're using the battery. The lower the cycle count, the longer you'll have before the battery loses its charge capacity.
    A recent addition to the Battery area is a button called "Charging". This button takes you to where you can adjust how fully and quickly your battery charges. There's a slider which lets you set how fully your battery charges. Options here range from 80 to 100 percent. Sacrificing some room at the top of a full charge will help maintain your battery's ability to charge and provide a normal amount of power for longer. If you're mainly in places where external power is available to charge your iPhone, this is useful since you don't necessarily need a full hundred percent charge available. If you do need that, another option called optimized charging can help. It uses artificial intelligence to learn your usage habits. It uses this information to predict when you'll actually need a full charge and only lets your iPhone charge above 80 percent when this is the case. This means that you can leave your iPhone plugged in overnight, and it won't charge up to 100 percent right away. Instead, it will remain below that level and only charge fully when it has determined that you're about to get up and require a full charge available. This reduces wear on your battery since it won't have sat at 100 percent charge all night.
    There is a lot of information in this area, including recommendations of settings you may wish to adjust to conserve power. You'll also find a button to test your battery health. There are also charts that detail your battery level over the past day, week, etc. Turning your rotor to Headings, you can flick down to another heading that separates this time-based battery information to data broken down by app and activity. Using these charts, you should be able to determine what is draining your battery the most and make decisions accordingly.
    Any charts in this section can be described by VoiceOver through the rotor. In fact, when you move onto a chart, flicking up or down will cycle through options to describe the chart, play an audio representation using tones, summarize the data, and describe the data series. These tools can quickly give you a picture of your battery level over time.
The General Settings Branch
There are a lot of settings in this major branch. The most frequently used of these for me is the Storage branch, which is covered in the iOS Operating System section of this guide. There are plenty of other branches to cover here that affect aspects of how your device behaves. While you won't need to change things too often, it's good to know what's in the General branch.
    If you ever want to know something about your device, double tap on the About button. A lot of information is nicely kept in this area. This includes everything from your device's capacity, to its model and serial number, to the current number of apps installed. It may help someone give you good tech support, especially if you don't know much about your device yet.
Software Update:
The Software Update button takes you to where you can obtain updates to the iOS operating system. You can also check to make certain you have the latest version of iOS. If a newer version is available, flick right over the items in this area, and you'll find a Download & Install Now button. Double tapping this will begin the process. You'll need to enter in your passcode or use Touch/Face ID to verify your identity. After this is done, the update process will begin. You should be charging your device so that a lack of battery power doesn't interrupt proceedings during this delicate process. For the early part of the process while the update downloads, you can check on progress since VoiceOver will still work. However, once the downloading has finished and installation begins, you will go through a period of time when your device will be silent as the update installs. You simply need to wait and hope things go well. This can be distressing, especially for beginners. I've never had to wait any longer than half an hour. Before contemplating resetting your device, I would recommend waiting at least that long. Interrupting an operating system update isn't something to be done lightly. Your patience should be rewarded with your device coming back to life with the latest iOS version installed.
    If you prefer, you can turn on automatic updating in this Software Update area. This way, updates to iOS will be automatically downloaded and installed when your device isn't being used, has a Wi-Fi connection, and is charging. Due to the likelihood of potentially serious accessibility glitches, particularly with the first and second updates to an iOS version, I can't recommend this in good conscience. On balance, having the latest version of iOS is a good thing overall. However, a regression or bug that only affects people needing accessibility features can too easily slip through the cracks and wreck your day. It's just better to look before you leap. Check on the AppleVis site and with others who you might know who have updated already. Once you know it's safe or are willing to take the risk, get the update manually as described above.
Airdrop:
The AirDrop setting lets you choose how broadly you want to use this handy method of sharing files and information. Nobody can steal anything you don't want them to have just because you're discoverable. However, you may wish to turn this capability off so that you won't receive AirDrop requests from people nearby. You can also set this feature so that only people in your contacts can discover your device for AirDrop sharing. Alternatively, you can set it so that everyone can discover your device.
    Basically, AirDrop lets you send and receive information from other people who own iOS devices and are physically near to you. When my wife Sara moved into our apartment, her GPS app didn't have the local landmarks that I had already put in to help navigate the local surroundings. I used AirDrop to share some key GPS landmarks with her, so she could get around more easily. I've also used AirDrop to share other files with people who were close by. There are only the three choices outlined above in the AirDrop setting. I have mine set to only be discoverable by people who are already in my list of contacts.
Background App Refresh
One of the ways your iOS device seems so downright ready for anything is that it lets apps run in the background and update their information. This makes certain that when you open the Mail app, it has likely checked recently for new email messages. When you're going about your day, this lets your weather app of choice alert you that it is likely to rain. Your GPS app can update you on landmarks you're approaching even when your device is locked, or you've been pulled into the Phone or Messages app because it can refresh its information in the background.
    Perhaps, you don't care if you find out about the latest Twitter happenings right away. You may not care that your emails are kept up to date until you're ready to open your mail app of choice and check them yourself. Apple gets this and has included settings in the Background App Refresh area to help you fine-tune which apps can or can't refresh while they're not in focus. Minimizing the ones that refresh can save battery power as well as data. In this area, there is a master toggle letting you decide on mass whether all apps may or may not refresh in the background. Alternatively, you can leave the master setting on and turn off the apps you don't want refreshing in the background. Apps are listed alphabetically and are either on or off. Double tap to change the status.
Keyboard Settings:
The settings in this area help customize how you can input information. You can add or remove virtual keyboards for different languages and third-party keyboards, etc. You can also change which options are active while they're being used. For instance, you can turn on or off autocorrect, spellchecking, and other similar options. This is also where you can enable dictation, which puts a Dictate button on the keyboard you're using. If dictation is enabled, it can even work offline. You can simply double tap the Dictate button, say what you want typed after the beep, and then double tap with two fingers anywhere on the screen to stop recording. The Text Replacement setting lets you assign short forms of phrases to automatically be replaced with other things when you type them. For instance, "CIA" might automatically be replaced with "Central Intelligence Agency". This kind of thing can help speed up typing for people.
Reset Options:
Perhaps, things aren't going well, and you need to start over from scratch. Maybe, it's just that network and device connectivity has gone wacky. Possibly, you can't remember all the location and privacy settings you've done and need to rethink all of that. In such circumstances, this is where you can go back to default settings and try again. None of these options should be used lightly or need to be used often. Especially the ones that erase all content and settings. Use those only as a last resort.
    The first option in this group simply lets you Reset All Settings to their factory defaults. It won't damage any content on your device. The next option will Erase All Content and Settings, so you'll be starting over from absolute scratch. Before you sell or give away your device, use this option to wipe it clean of all your digital property. The Reset Network Settings option is relatively safe to use, provided you remember any passwords you need to log on to networks. All of that information is erased so that everything connects as if for the first time. This is a commonly used method for resolving issues where external devices such as keyboards aren't connecting properly. The Reset Keyboard Dictionary might get you out of a situation where you've added a misspelled word or can't remember all the clever abbreviations you've thought up. Another option lets you Reset Home Screen Layout to the factory default. Any additional apps will be arranged in alphabetical order. Another option lets you Reset Location & Privacy settings.
    For all of these options, you'll need to confirm that you want to take the action they are for. You'll need your passcode number or, possibly, your Apple account password. Once implemented, there's no going back, so think carefully before you use these reset options. If you're backed up to iCloud or iTunes, you should be able to restore from that backup. This can be a time-consuming process, and you'll want to be on Wi-Fi to have all your apps and other data restored as speedily and inexpensively as possible. Remember that some content and apps aren't set up to use iCloud. For instance, I've needed to delete all the Kindle books on my iPhone and then re-download them each time I've upgraded to a new iPhone or restored from an iCloud backup.
Other General Settings
At the very end of the General settings branch is a Shutdown option. This lets you safely turn off your device if you find the side button and volume button combination tricky to use. There are also settings for Language & Region preferences, Date & Time, VPN connection if you need that, and more. Be sure to take the time to look around this branch carefully. There's quite a bit tucked in here, and it's all useful at least occasionally.
Control Centre Settings:
While never absolutely essential, the Control Centre is a very handy feature of iOS. The settings in this area let you customize what can be found in the "Centre" and when it can be accessed. There is a toggle that lets you decide whether the Control Centre can be accessed from within apps or only from the home screen.
    Immediately to the right of this setting, you'll find a button called Customize Controls. Double tap this, and you will be in an area that lets you select, remove, and reorder controls to maximize how effective the Control Centre is for you. There's a heading called Include, beneath which you will find any options you have selected for inclusion in the Control Centre. Double tap these to remove them if you wish. You may also rearrange them via the rotor or by dragging the Reorder buttons next to them up or down. The rotor will let you move controls up or down one space at a time. Learning to drag controls by double tapping and holding down the Reorder button and then moving your finger up or down can accelerate the process when you've gotten the hang of it.
    The last option in this area lets you reset your control panel to factory default. This is useful if you've gone too far in your efforts to customize the control centre and need to start fresh.
    As of iOS 18, you can further customize the control centre from within it. When in the control centre, touch a control so that it's in focus and then flick up or down. You'll hear VoiceOver say "edit controls". Double tap this to enter a mode where you can add, remove and rearrange controls.
Display & Brightness
This area has one of those nice, self-explanatory names. You can select between a light or dark overall appearance. Alternatively, you can have your device automatically switch to an appropriate mode based on options that become available if Automatic mode is turned on. The default there is Light Until Sunset. The next settings have to do with screen brightness. I habitually have this set to 0% to save battery power. However, you might want to set this higher so that a sighted person can see and read your display if you think you may need assistance. The next setting is called Night Shift, which you can schedule or disable. It removes colours from the display during the evening that are known to cause sleep difficulties. I have no idea whether this effects totally blind people.
    Your device may or may not support True Tone. This feature uses light sensors in your device to adjust the colour pallet of your display according to current ambient lighting conditions. This is presumably helpful for those who can see. Should this feature prove troublesome when making digital drawings or something, it can be disabled.
    The Auto-Lock feature causes your device to dim and then fully lock the screen if enough time passes without action being taken. The intentions of this feature are to save your battery power and enhance your overall security. However, this feature can be most annoying if you like to pause and think about what you're doing before doing it. I disable this feature by setting to Never. Provided you remember to lock your device when you're not using it, this is perfectly good. However, you can set it to various lengths of inactive time before it dims and locks on you. The default is annoyingly brief, especially while you're learning the ropes. I think it's thirty seconds. Certainly, no more than a minute. It's one of the first things I attend to when I get a new device.
    The Raise to Wake feature causes your device to become active when it is lifted or tilted. This is a basic on/off toggle that I prefer deactivated. I find that more often than not, it causes my iPhone to go active in my pocket when I don't want it to. The text size and choice of views don't make much difference to totally blind people, but may prove useful for people with low vision. However, I believe that the features found in Accessibility settings will likely address their needs far more capably.
Accessibility Settings:
There are a lot of settings in this space. Paradoxically, the two most useful branches in this area are VoiceOver and Voice Control settings. Because these two branches of accessibility settings are so integral to the accessibility tools they control, these particular branches will be discussed in the major sections dedicated to VoiceOver and Voice Control. When dealing with things as pervasive in your experience of iOS, it seems more sensible to keep all the information you'll need in one place. Other parts of this large and useful area will be discussed below. We won't cover everything as exhaustively as we will with the VoiceOver and Voice Control settings elsewhere in this guide. However, we'll go over some of the settings that are most likely to benefit people who are blind. People with specific disabilities should explore this area of settings thoroughly, and also consult the user guide for their device and version of iOS put out by Apple. There may very well be options here that will help with your particular disabilities.
    The Accessibility settings branch is divided up into sections via headings based on type of disability. The topmost heading is Vision. Below are Physical and Motor, Hearing, and finally, General. We'll explore each section for useful treasures.
Vision
Most people who are classified as legally blind actually have some impaired but potentially useful vision. Apple has incorporated extensive tools to maximize what people with different eye conditions can do with their iOS devices. The very first and most often used of these features is called Zoom. It magnifies areas of the screen as needed. You can customize how this feature behaves in many ways. Once the feature is turned on, you can cause Zoom to occur by double tapping with three fingers on the screen. Dragging three fingers over the screen will cause the affected area to move to the part of the screen you require "zoomed". You can change the Zoom level by double tapping with three fingers and then dragging them over the screen. You can have Zoom follow where iOS or the app you're using thinks focus should be so that this is magnified automatically. There are keyboard shortcuts you can set, much like with VoiceOver. You can have a Zoom Controller constantly available on screen that lets you adjust various aspects of Zoom as needed. You can also choose how large a region will be automatically zoomed. The default setting for this is Full Screen. You can apply filters to Zoom including Grayscale, Inverted, and others. There is also a setting to set the maximum Zoom level. The default is 5.0x. This seems like a brief description of a very powerful feature. Being totally blind, I don't feel qualified to go much further.
    Occasionally, you need to magnify something in the real world, like print on a product or sign. Apple includes a Magnifier option that takes advantage of your device's built-in rear camera. This seems to be a pretty simple option to use. When turned on, you can use the Accessibility Shortcut to activate and dismiss the magnifier. Unlike Zoom with its many settings, there's just one for the magnifier. This is whether or not you want Auto-Adjust Exposure. Basically, this lets the artificial intelligence in your device adjust brightness and contrast based on ambient light settings. Sounds like something worth taking for a spin.
    The Display & Text Size button should definitely be checked out thoroughly, as there's an awful lot tucked away behind it. There are colour filters, adjustments that can be made to labels, the ability to reduce the white point, and numerous other things which will forever be utterly beyond my experience. People with any sort of visual difficulty short of total blindness should certainly explore all the options in here. There's bound to be something that can help at least a little.
    Generally, people seem to like the animated look of iOS. Elements move in an out of focus as needed and are animated in other ways, providing for a lively environment. For some people, the animation, and motion of elements on the screen can be troublesome. The Motion area has settings to reduce things like the parallax effect present in the normal interface. These settings are unlikely to benefit totally blind people, besides the one that disables the automatic playing of videos. These often have sound that can make other elements of websites harder to hear. People with low vision may find various options in here to be helpful, as they can reduce clutter.
    The Spoken Content settings let people who don't need a full screen reader still enjoy having text spoken aloud when desired. This can be helpful for people with reading difficulties or people who have vision difficulties that make reading a strain on their eyes. Of course, some people simply like to be read to every now and then. Settings in Spoken Content let you select text to be read out loud. Alternatively, you can swipe downwards on any screen with two fingers and have the contents read aloud. For blind people encountering a speaking bar as they go about their business, turn off the Speak Selection option and all your hang-ups with the speaking bar, which has somehow become active, will be a problem of the past.
    The Audio Descriptions setting is the last in the Vision area. You can use this to make any descriptive audio included in videos, shows, and movies be played automatically by apps that support this setting. This can make a tremendous difference in the ability of someone who is blind or can't see well enough to follow action on the screen. The Apple TV and iTunes apps, plus others like Netflix, will honour this setting and play descriptive tracks when they're available. If you have the Audio Descriptions setting on but don't hear described audio while using a third-party app, remember to check for options within that app. Especially after you start content playing. Seek options in the controls that emerge when you double tap on the video.
Physical and Motor
The settings in this section help people who find it physically difficult to use the standard touchscreen interface. The difficulties can stem from a wide range of causes, from cerebral palsy through to paralysis. This is where the Voice Control setting is found. Voice Control will be described in its own section later. Meanwhile, there are a whole range of other settings to help people adjust the interface to their needs.
Touch
The settings behind this button are designed to help people who find it hard to touch and operate the screen. Some of these may prove helpful, but I've found some features that I've actually chosen to disable. These include Reachability, which lowers the top half of the screen when you swipe down at the bottom of the screen so that the top is easier to reach. You hear a small hiss indicating when this has occurred. I find this very annoying and disabled Reachability, so stuff would stay the heck where it was.
    Another potentially annoying or helpful feature depending on your circumstances is Tap to Wake. This will, as its name suggests, cause your display to wake up when you tap it anywhere with a finger. This feature won't unlock your device for you. You still need to do that. However, I found that when I carried my iPhone in my pocket, it would tend to come alive and start reading out the time or my notifications as I walked along. I doubt this would be as likely to occur while using an iPad. It can be nice not to have to use the Action button to awaken your device from slumber.
Switch Control
This lets you operate your iOS device using any of a wide range of devices that are all basically "switches". These can be on or off, and you would perhaps nod your head, breathe, blink, etc. to indicate your intention. I've never heard of a blind person using this in conjunction with VoiceOver. However, given how flexible these features are, I believe it should be possible if possibly frustrating. The cursor moves over options, and you need to activate the switch when it reaches what you desire.
    You can adjust all sorts of things including how options are grouped, how fast the cursor moves over things, and much more. There are sound settings, so you might find it helpful to use these in conjunction with VoiceOver. I have never had occasion to use any switch devices, so I have no idea how well this might work. I've heard that it's possible to use the camera built into your device as a switch. You can nod your head and possibly do other facial gestures to indicate your intent.
Hearing
These settings are for people with anywhere from mild hearing difficulties through to people who are completely unable to hear sound. Some hearing devices are made for use with Apple products and take advantage of Made For iPhone (MFi) technology. If you use such devices or other hearing aids, you'll find settings in this section to help maximize what you can do. This includes streaming sound via Bluetooth to your hearing aids. You will also find a TTY setting letting you use the Phone app to make and receive TTY calls. I see no reason why this wouldn't work in conjunction with VoiceOver. If you have a hardware TTY device, you can pair it to your iPhone and have it used rather than Apple's TTY software if you prefer.
    The Audio/Visual button has settings to do things like adjust the balance between left and right or force mono audio playback. These settings don't require hearing aids and may prove useful to blind people with hearing difficulties. One of these is called "power on and off sounds". Having this set to on will cause your iPhone to vibrate and play short musical sounds to indicate when your iPhone is turned on or off. Helpful when turning your iPhone on with the power button, this audible and tactile confirmation can be especially useful when your iPhone restarts during the updating process.
General
This area currently contains four small branches. The first is Guided Access. This may be useful for people with attention issues. It keeps you in a single app and allows you to control which features you want to use. You can set time limits and a passcode to override this confinement. The Accessibility Shortcut can be used to turn this feature on or off. I've most often heard of this being used in the classroom to keep the attention of students focused on apps used for assignments.
    The next item is Siri. If you cannot speak clearly enough for Siri to understand your voice, you can set an option in this branch that lets you type your commands and queries. When you invoke Siri, a typing field will appear. SIRI can still respond via voice and text on the screen as normal. You can also choose when you want to receive voice feedback rather than just text on the screen.
    The next item under the General, Accessibility heading is a crucial one. It is the Accessibility Shortcut. On devices with a Home button, press this three times rapidly to invoke the Accessibility Shortcut. On devices without a home button, press the Action button on the side of the device three times rapidly. The Accessibility Shortcut can be set to activate and deactivate one or more accessibility options that you find useful. Most blind people will set the shortcut for turning VoiceOver on or off. You can set it to also turn on other features such as Zoom, Voice Control, Switch Control, or Invert Colours, among other features. Be aware that if you do this, VoiceOver won't automatically start speaking when the shortcut is invoked. Instead, a menu of any selected option will be put on the screen. For instance, VoiceOver and Hearing controls. To make a choice, drag your finger across the bottom of the screen. When you move over a choice, it will be announced out loud. Once you've found the choice you want, simply lift your finger after hearing it spoken and the feature will be toggled on or off. People should set up this shortcut right away after setting up their iOS device so that the accessibility features they need will be easy to turn on or off as desired.
    A new addition to this area as of iOs 18 is called per-app settings. Sometimes, it's use-full to have different accessibility settings active or behaving differently for certain apps. This area allows you to customize mainly touch and vision related features. For now, this doesn't include any settings which I've personally found useful being totally blind. However, people with other disabilities in addition to blindness may ind some useful options here. Also, Apple might add to the features which it's possible to customize on a per-app basis in future updates.
Action Button:
This will appear on any iPhone which has an action button rather than a mute switch positioned above the volume buttons along the left side. There's a simple slider letting you make a primary selection. For instance, you might select the Voice Memos setting so that holding the action button in will cause the Voice Memos app to continue recording a new memo until you release the button. The options along the slider include accessibility, silent mode, focus, and numerous others. After choosing an option, flick right to find an additional "choose" button, which will let you specify further what you want the action button to do for you. For instance, after selecting the controls option on the slider, flicking right will reveal a button which you can use to select which control you want the action button to invoke. For example, quicknote.
Apple Intelligence and Siri:
This area contains settings that let you customize how you invoke Siri and which apps are allowed to tie into Siri. This is also where you'll decide aspects of how the new Apple Intelligence will interact with your activities and apps. These settings are covered later in this guide in a section called Siri and Apple Intelligence.
Camera:
There are a great many settings in the Camera branch. On the latest iPhones, these include settings for the camera control. This smooth sensitive patch is a combined touch surface and button found along the right side a small distance below the lock and power button. You can set it to do things like control the zoom of the camera when you slide your finger along it. Clicking the camera button and holding it in will always activate the visual intelligence feature if your iPhone supports it.
The Security Grouping:
Past this point, we enter a short stretch of branches which relate to security and privacy of information on your iPhone. This area contains Touch/Face ID and Passcode, Emergency SOS, and ends with Privacy and Security. Apple has moved a number of options which used to be their own branches into offshoots of these three. Others which somewhat broke up the theme of security have been moved to other places. For instance, the Battery branch is now found before the general settings branch.
Touch/Face ID & Passcode
This is where you set up your passcode and other biometric security measures that keep your information safe on your iOS device. To learn more, please read the section in this guide called Privacy and Security.
Emergency SOS
This feature lets you easily use your iPhone to call emergency services if you're ever in need of them. This requires that your iPhone have a SIM card or ESIM. There are a number of settings in here that are all fairly self-explanatory. If your device has a Home button, you can press it rapidly five times to trigger the Emergency SOS feature. When this is done, any contacts you have set up in the Health settings will be alerted and shown your location. Also, the phone will count down and then call whatever the local emergency number is. For instance, in Canada, this is 911.
    As of iOS, 15, the new default method to initiate an emergency call is to hold in the power button and one of the volume buttons at the same time. After a short period, the emergency procedures will start. This should work much better for blind people and prevent them from accidentally triggering an emergency call while attempting to do the triple click accessibility shortcut to activate or deactivate VoiceOver. There is a setting that appears if you've elected to use Automatic Calling. In this case, a warning sound will play as the countdown before the call is made happens. You can turn off this warning sound if you wish. If your iPhone has no Home button, the power button is used instead. The Call with power Button setting may be a good setting to turn off. Recall that pressing the power button three times is how you invoke the Accessibility Shortcut. Some people have accidentally triggered a call to emergency services when they were clicking the Power button too rapidly and not putting a pause in between sets of three clicks. Turning off the setting will prevent this ever, resulting in five rapid clicks being counted and acted upon. This makes it safe to invoke the Accessibility Shortcut quickly. Unfortunately, this safeguard doesn't seem to be available on older iPhones with home buttons, like my iPhone 7. When Call with Side Button is turned off, you can still invoke Emergency SOS by holding down the Volume Up and Side buttons for around a second. A menu then pops up containing an emergency option as well as an option to shut down your iPhone.
Privacy Settings
These settings are discussed in the section called Privacy and Security.
Wallet & Apple Pay Settings
This branch lets you set up Apple Pay. This feature lets you pay for things in the real world as well as online using your iOS device. Rather than presenting a credit card, you can simply hold your device near a point-of-sale machine and follow the steps to use Apple Pay. This involves verifying your identity using Face or Touch ID, holding your iOS device near the point-of-sale machine, and double clicking the Side button. This branch of settings is also where you can add cards to your Wallet for use with Apple Pay.
    Other settings in this branch let you choose whether Apple Pay is available from the lock screen, set up a transit card, and more. Apple Pay is widely supported at retail stores and other places of commerce. This adds the security of not divulging your credit card details, since a one-time code is used for any purchase you make with Apple Pay.
Passwords & Accounts
This setting is discussed in the section called Privacy and Security.
Apps:
As of iOS 18, you will find a button called "Apps" at the very bottom of the Settings options. Double tapping this will get you into a large area where any settings related to various apps can be found. This is the case regardless of whether they're made by Apple or by a third-party developer. This is whee to look for settings related to such things as mail, Contacts, Calendar, Notes, Reminders, Voice Memos, Phone, Messages, FaceTime, Maps, Compass, Measure, Safari, News, Stocks, Health, Shortcuts, Music, TV, Photos, Camera, Books, Podcasts, etc. If there's an app with the appropriate name on your iPhone, this is where you'll find the settings for it. Apps in the list are always kept in alphabetical order. Simply double tap on the name of an app to get to its settings. Navigate quickly through to the app you want using the slider or the index, which lets you flick up or down quickly to each letter. Alternatively, there's a search field where you can type in the name of the app you are looking for. These facilities for navigation will grow increasingly useful as your collection of apps expands over time.
App Store Settings
In this small branch of apps, you can make decisions regarding whether content and apps you purchase from the app store or iTunes are downloaded automatically or not. You'll find on/off toggles for a number of purchase categories. These include apps, updates to those apps, music, Apple Books and audiobooks. Next, you'll find a heading called Cellular Data. Below it, you'll find an option to choose whether automatic download can occur using cellular data, rather than just when connected to Wi-Fi. Next to this, you'll find an option where you can decide to be asked if a download will be larger than a set number of megabytes.
    Other settings let you decide whether videos play automatically while in the app store. When VoiceOver or other accessibility settings are active, they may set this to off so that you're not distracted by videos playing. The final setting here lets you determine whether you'll be asked for ratings and reviews. These can be helpful for others making decisions about which apps, books, or music to purchase. Providing such information is always optional, even when this setting is in the on setting.
Mail Settings
This branch gives you the ability to configure the Mail app that comes with your device. There are many options, including whether you want messages organized into conversation threads. There are choices about when or if you want to be notified when new messages arrive. You can manage blocked email addresses, decide whether you want images to be loaded automatically onto your device, and much more. For more information, please refer to the user guide that Apple makes available for your device. Also, remember that if you aren't happy with the Mail app these settings help you configure, there are many other options available in the app store.
Contacts Settings
This branch lets you configure how the Contacts app behaves. You can determine how contacts are organized. Most of the settings deal with this. However, at the very end of these is a button that lets you import contacts from a SIM card. This may ease the process of transferring to an iPhone from another kind of phone if you've already put contacts on the card.
Calendar Settings
There are a few settings in this branch that configure the calendar. You can choose a default calendar, override the current time zone, so appointments are displayed in a time zone of your choosing, determine which calendars are used, etc. The last toggle setting determines whether Siri will offer location advice, such as an estimated time to travel from your current location.
Notes Settings
The Notes app provides a way to quickly write or draw things as the need arises. There are a number of useful configuration options here. For example, you can secure your notes with a password, keeping them safe from others who might use your device. You can decide how notes are sorted or whether grid lines are placed automatically on notes to aid in drawing, etc. For blind people, the most useful of these settings is at the end of the branch. The Access Notes from Lock Screen setting will let you choose to have a new note open whenever you use the Control Centre to access the Notes app. This can be very handy if you are on the move and need to quickly get to a space where it's possible to write or dictate information. You can have it start a new note or simply continue in the current note.
Reminders Settings
This is a small branch, as the Reminders app doesn't require a lot of settings. You can set a default list if you want one apart from the automatically generated one. You can also set a time when you'll be notified of any reminders that don't have a specific time during the day. You can also decide whether reminders are shown as overdue starting from the day after their due date.
Voice Memos Settings
Again, there isn't a lot here. However, you can choose whether the Voice Memos app saves recordings in compressed or lossless quality. Also, you can choose whether these memos are named based on the location where they're recorded.
Phone Settings
This is where you would go if you have an iPhone and you want to configure anything related to actual phone service. You can do things like silence all unknown callers so that all unknown calls are automatically sent to voicemail. You can manage blocked callers, choose whether calls are announced, and much more. Please refer to the user guide for your iPhone.
Messages and FaceTime Settings
There are many settings here that let you optimize how messages are dealt with. The Messages app lets you send and receive text messages to people who have other kinds of cellular phones. It's worth exploring the settings in here to make certain that the Message app behaves as you would like it to. Please refer to your user guide for more thorough discussion of the options here. There aren't any settings of particular use to blind people here, and the default options have served me quite well.
    Similarly, there are options for FaceTime that largely mirror those for messages. As FaceTime is exclusively for communications between Apple devices, there are fewer settings for it. One setting of note lets you determine whether live photos can be captured during a conversation. For blind people, there may be no audible indication when someone you're talking to decides to capture a photo. If you're worried about this, you can turn this feature off to help insure your privacy.
Maps Settings
There are many settings here. You can choose a preferred style of travel to be used when getting directions. It is also possible to choose units of distance, have weather information displayed, and much more. In the Driving & Navigation button, you can select the volume of navigation announcements, and choose whether other spoken content like podcasts are automatically paused during announcements. You can also choose how relatively loud you want such announcements to be. For more details, please refer to the user guide for your device as well as the section called Maps, Taps, and GPS Apps.
Safari Settings
There are a lot of settings that allow you to configure the Safari web browser included with your device. Please refer to the section called On Safari to learn about these settings and more.
Health Settings
There are a number of settings here that determine how the Health app behaves and what data it has to work from. For blind people, one of the more important aspects is the Notifications setting. You can have health-related notifications delivered in a style that differs from your default settings if you wish. This is also where you can enter your health profile and Medical ID. The Medical ID can be accessed from the Emergency Dialer even when your device is locked. It contains information about you, such as allergies or medical conditions that emergency attendants should know about. The Health Profile contains other information such as sex, age, and blood and skin type, etc. More is added depending on which apps and accessories you might use.
    The Data Access & Devices button lets you control what can access and be a source of data for the Health app. This includes third-party apps and equipment such as smart scales, fitness machines, etc. It also includes other Apple devices, such as an Apple Watch or iPad. You can always revoke access to this data. For a lot more information, please refer to the user guide provided by Apple for your specific device.
Music, Books, TV, and Podcast Settings
Each service has a number of useful settings that will be discussed in the appropriate sections of this guide. There are a number of very useful settings that allow you to configure the Music app. These include an EQ option, which has a lot of different choices to alter how your music sounds. Please refer to the section called Carrying a Great Many Tunes.
    Settings that affect how books are displayed, how large an interval is jumped backward or forward when navigating audiobooks, and more are found here. Please refer to the section called Read All About It.
    The Podcasts app has a number of significant settings, especially when it comes to how much data is used. Please refer to the section called Internet Radio and Podcasts.
Further Thoughts on Settings
This is by no means an exhaustive tour. However, we've now covered a lot of the major settings where it makes sense not to cover them elsewhere in the guide. This section could easily have reached over fifty thousand words had we included painstaking explanations of all settings in the same place. Apple has done a lot to lessen the sprawling nature of the root and branches of Settings. It feels a lot more approachable and organized. Moving the settings of all the apps produced by Apple into the ever expandable "Apps" area certainly reduces clutter. This is the change which has taken the longest for me to become accustomed to. With over four hundred apps, I have a lot to move through. However, the index slider and headings rotor do a lot to eliminate any irritation. I can get to where I need to be relatively quickly.
    This is the main point of overall control between you and iOS. Just because we didn't discuss an option doesn't mean it's not present. Always check Settings if you want an app to behave in a certain way, but can find no way to achieve that from within the app itself. For instance, the game Six Ages has a number of special settings. One of these is a way to set the volume of sounds and music. You could use this to lower the volume to make it easier to hear VoiceOver during game play while still enjoying the full experience. Lots of little treasures like that await you in the farther reaches of Settings. Never give up until you have looked in Settings to see if there might be an option that does what you wish.

Managing Sound on iOS Devices:
For blind people, sound tends to loom large in everyday life. It takes on a primary role that is often not fully appreciated by people with sight. One thing which tends to be important to blind users is how an operating system handles sound from various sources and how one controls this. For example, can you be certain that you'll always hear the VoiceOver screen reader even if you're listening to loud music or a show? On the other hand, is it possible to make certain you don't miss part of an online conversation because an unwanted notification suddenly read by VoiceOver blots out a speaker's words? How easy is it to alter the overall balance in order to hear higher frequencies more clearly?
    The iOS operating system has evolved as the hardware grew in power from a time when iPhones were looked at as little more than accessories. As a result, many of its tools for managing sound are outgrowths of this earlier more simple time. Now that these devices are as powerful as many desktop computers, decisions made back then are showing their age. Ways to manage sound are scattered throughout various areas of iOS. There's no central point for sound management or mixing. This section is my attempt to help you navigate and know about all of the audio related capabilities at your disposal. I'll also point out where you need to go in iOS to take as much control of what you hear as iOS allows you to do. Thankfully, things have markedly improved in iOS 18. Readers of previous editions of this guide should particularly pay attention to the updates to audio ducking. Let us begin this ramshackle trip at an obvious starting point.
A Volumetric Mystery Tour:
Checking my email one morning, I found a rather panicky message from a man whose iPhone had gone unexpectedly silent on him overnight. He had listened to music and read a book before falling asleep. Not at all an unusual way for an iPhone owner to wind down. He had a very pleasant time. There were no problems hearing the music, the book or the VoiceOver screen reader. Upon waking up, he tried to check the time by pressing the action button. Since the iPhone was left on and plugged in to charge overnight, he was surprised to hear nothing at all from his iPhone. What happened?
    The cause of this stubborn silence on the part of his iPhone turned out to be the way iOS handles volume levels. He had been enjoying the music and other audio while wearing his AirPods. Apple separately keeps track of the volume levels you last set while wearing AirPods, using other headsets or Bluetooth speakers, and when you listen using the built-in speakers in your device. The presumption being that people will prefer different volume levels in circumstances when they use any of these different methods. This way, when they next use a particular method of listening, the volume will be closer to what they're likely to want, and they'll have to adjust it less often.
    This tends to work quite well for people who can see. They can quickly ascertain the volume level visually. For people who need to hear their iPhones to have any kind of control over them beyond a very basic level, this can cause trouble. It's hard to change settings if you can't even navigate to them. Moments of terror might not be too overly dramatic.
    This fellow plugged the iPhone in while still wearing his AirPods. He therefore heard the bing made when the iPhone began charging. Next, he locked his iPhone, took out his AirPods and plugged them in to charge. Placing both items on a nightstand, he went to sleep.
    The unexpected and unwanted moments of silence from his iPhone which he experienced upon waking certainly got him galvanized in a heaping hurry.
    The seeds of this rude awakening were actually set in motion much earlier. Just before putting his AirPods in for an evening's enjoyment, he had gotten himself a drink and settled into a comfortable chair. His iPhone was in his pocket. Reaching to set down the drink on a table, he unknowingly pressed the lower volume button in against a harder point of an armrest. Because no sound was made as the volume dropped quickly to zero, he had no idea of this. The volume button was held in by being squished against the armrest. It was released when he straightened in his chair and removed his iPhone from his pocket. He hadn't expected to hear anything from his iPhone until putting in his AirPods. As usual, he heard the friendly bong indicating his AirPods were ready and proceeded to enjoy the evening.
    The iOS operating system remembered the volume he last set while using AirPods and had switched to that level. Meanwhile, the speaker volume was at zero. Having no idea that iOS kept separate track of volume levels, this man had no cause to suspect trouble. Thankfully, others on the email list had experienced this before and all was quickly set right again.
    Beyond keeping track of different volume settings for different accessories, there are other volume related quirks to be aware of. The volume buttons will raise and lower the overall volume of all sound sources. This is true even if they have separate volume controls. Therefore, you can have the VoiceOver volume set all the way at a hundred percent but won't hear any speech if the general volume level is set to zero. VoiceOver can't ever be louder than the general volume level. However, it's quite possible to set the VoiceOver volume all the way down to 1%. You won't hear VoiceOver speaking even if your iPhone volume is set to 100% unless your ear is very close to the iPhone and there's no other noise where you are.
    The bit exception to this is for a category of sounds called "ringer and alerts". If you go into settings and into an area called "sound and haptics", You will find a heading called "ringer and alerts". After that heading, there is a volume slider which you can use to set a different volume level for these important sounds. This way, you can be certain that you'll hear the phone ring and hear other critical notification sounds. Meanwhile, you can have music or other media you're listening to be at a quieter volume.
    Here's another potential trouble spot for the unaware. You can choose whether to be able to adjust the ringer and alert volume level with the volume buttons, or have it only be adjustable by going into Settings and moving that slider. The latter option is what I recommend. If you let the volume buttons adjust the ringer and alerts, keep in mind that changes you make in a panicked moment when the phone ringer goes off too loudly for a given situation will persist afterwards. You might get a message sound during a meeting and quickly quiet it via the volume buttons only to miss a phone call later on because the ringer was now set very quiet. You can only use the volume buttons to make adjustments while the ringer or alert sounds which are long enough are playing. Raising the overall volume when no alert sound or ringer is playing won't affect the volume for ringer and alert sounds. If you have the volume buttons unable to adjust the ringer and alerts, you can set a level you prefer in most situations and know that it'll be locked in until you go into Settings and adjust it.
    Rather than providing users with a group of sliders which control the volume level for various audio sources, Apple has taken a different path. Basically, you adjust the volume of whatever audio is active at the time. Thus, if you're listening to music, this is what will decrease or increase when you use the slider in the control panel or the volume buttons on your device.
    Many apps have their own handy volume controls. This is especially welcome and likely when you're dealing with apps which create ambient background sound. The Nature Space and My Noise apps are two good examples of this. You can use volume controls inside the app to set the volume of the ambient sound to a level lower than the general volume and lower than VoiceOver speech output. This way, you can have steady soundscapes in the background while you work. There's a volume control in the Music app. However, it seems to be set to adjust the general volume level. This works well for sighted users who aren't reliant on hearing a screen reader. VoiceOver volume can be controlled via a rotor setting or in the VoiceOver quick settings if you have volume as an active option. However, it's still relative to the general volume level. For example, let's say you're hearing music at the volume of 75%. If you set VoiceOver to 100%, it will be just as loud as the music. You can lower the VoiceOver volume to 75% and the music will be 25% louder than the speech output from VoiceOver.
    In the event that you're faced with the situation where you've accidentally set your VoiceOver volume down to 1%, raising the overall volume level to maximum should allow you to hear VoiceOver speaking very quietly. With your ear near the iPhone, you should be able to hear it enough to get to the VoiceOver volume in the rotor, Quick settings or regular VoiceOver settings where you can raise it. If you put VoiceOver volume in your quick settings and remove it from your rotor, this should reduce the chances of accidentally adjusting the VoiceOver volume.
    Overall volume can be adjusted by the volume buttons even while your iPhone is locked. This wonderfully facilitates changing the volume while the iPhone is in your pocket. However, just like what happened to our man with the silent iPhone, the same thing could potentially happen in other circumstances. The volume buttons will move the level up or down by around six percent when pressed in. When VoiceOver is active, you'll actually hear a kind of tick each time you do this. However, if a volume button is held in, it will change the level rapidly and make no ticking sound until you release the button. Apple has introduced tactile feedback which can alert you. However, if you have it turned off or set to a weaker level like many people opt for, you likely won't feel it while the iPhone isn't in your hand. Given this, the first thing to do if you're faced with a silent iPhone is to push the upper volume button and release it quickly. Keep doing that until you hear ticks and use those to fine tune your volume. That's far less potentially startling than having VoiceOver speak and possibly say something loudly. 
The Safety And Peril of Audio Ducking:
One feature Apple included in VoiceOver is designed to make absolutely certain that speech output supersedes all other audio which might be coming from your device. Audio ducking instantly, and potentially drastically, reduces the volume of any audio while VoiceOver is speaking. You'll never miss an important notification, even if you're listening to an action movie at full volume.
    So what's the peril with this kind of arrangement? Basically, if you have audio ducking set too high, you'll cause other audio to be ducked so low that you may miss significant information conveyed by it rather than VoiceOver. The audio remains ducked for around a second after VoiceOver has stopped speaking.
    Thankfully, Apple has finally given you control over how much the other audio is ducked below speech. Also, you have the very welcome option of setting audio ducking either to always on, or only when speaking. These settings can be made available on the rotor or in VoiceOver quick settings. Now that this is the case, you have a high level of quick and flexible control over the balance between VoiceOver and other audio. Just remember that audio ducking effects the ringer and alert sounds. Setting audio ducking too high might result in those being missed. One solution to this is to turn on haptics so that you'll at least feel vibrations when things happen in the background.
    Let's say you're attending an online conference with live panel discussions. In that kind of situation, you might want to turn audio ducking off and even decrease VoiceOver volume so that the discussion voices are loudest, but you can still hear VoiceOver well enough to take notes. On the other hand, if you're putting in long hours writing, you might want a stable level of background sound or music to help you stay focussed. In that kind of situation, having audio ducking set to always on and finding the most suitable amount of ducking is the best way to keep everything steady. If you have audio ducking set to only drop the audio when VoiceOver speaks, the level of the other audio will keep fluctuating. Entering a character which is read back by typing echo will cause a second of ducking. This may work well if you only need a low level of ducking, but you'll find it jarring at higher ducking levels. . Sticking with that movie example, you might miss key information such as a moment of dialogue or events which happen while VoiceOver is speaking. This will cut into your enjoyment of the movie for something you could just as well have waited to hear after you finished. Each time you navigate to controls to pause or take other action, VoiceOver will drop the level of audio, and you'll miss possibly key moments entirely. Change these settings as you need to with the rotor or quick settings.
    One approach to having adjustments be more automatic is through VoiceOver activities. You can take advantage of VoiceOver activities to have settings like audio ducking turn off automatically when you're watching a show, using Zoom, etc. This approach has the advantage of only having to create activities once for each circumstance where you want different settings to apply. The catch is that you might not want the same circumstances all the time when using particular apps or doing certain things.
Headphone Accommodations:
If you have Apple or Beats headphones, including all types of AirPods and EarPods as well as Beats headphones, you can tap into this handy feature. It boosts the volume of a range of frequencies. You can use Apple's default settings for boosting balanced tones, vocal range, or bright high frequencies. This can make things much easier to hear. Especially if you have any kind of moderate hearing loss.
    You'll find this capability in the Accessibility settings. Specifically, head to the audio/visual area found under the "Hearing" heading of accessibility settings. Once there, double tap on headphone accommodation. You'll find several options. One of these will let you create a custom audio setup. This will guide you through asking questions and getting a sense of what you want to hear more clearly. For many of us, this might be overkill. Instead, you can do what I've done. I used one of the three generic choices. The first of these boosts a balanced range of frequencies so that softer sounds or parts of music are louder. Another choice concentrates on the vocal range, so voices are more clear and easy to distinguish. The third choice raises the volume of higher frequencies so things sound brighter. This can be very helpful making VoiceOver speech output stand out more clearly. There are three levels of strength from light, moderate or strong. This lets you further customize how much the sound is modified without choices becoming overwhelming.
    In my case, the balanced strong combination works very well for me. I can typically hear VoiceOver even while listening to background music, podcasts, etc. This is a much appreciated option which can sometimes let me avoid needing to use audio ducking while I work. I don't need to worry as much about missing out on notifications or being pulled out of my sound environment.
    For people who have hearing aids and have access to their audiogram, you can import that and have it adjust the frequencies specific to your hearing loss. This might make all the difference for your experience with using VoiceOver. Especially while listening to additional sound on your iPhone like music, podcasts, etc.
Music Related Settings:
The other area where you'll find plenty of settings to change how things sound is in the music settings. I go through these settings in some detail in the section related to music. However, I'll highlight a few especially important ones here.
    The sound check option will attempt to normalize the volume of the music you play so that you aren't plagued by large jumps in volume level. This certainly helps keep things within tolerable variance from track to track. I basically leave the setting on. Some albums might intentionally vary the volume of songs as part of the overall performance. You may want to disable the feature if this is the case in order to allow that variation to happen.
    The other major treasure in the music settings is the EQ button. This lets you pick from a wide range of different EQ settings which change how music sounds. This can be helpful in making it possible to listen to music while still being able to hear VoiceOver speech output. In particular, people may wish to try the "Late Night" setting. There are quite a few options in the music settings so I would encourage everyone to explore these thoroughly.
Sound Thinking:
Besides various volume levels, iOS also records what audio you last played. Let's say I'm listening to some music and want to switch to hearing a podcast. I go into the Castro app, my podcast player app of choice. If I thoughtlessly try to start it playing using the two finger double tap or "magic tap", I'll hear the music that I was previously listening-to continue to play. It still as focus as the last active audio source. I need to use the play option in the Castro app to start hearing the podcast I expect, and for that app to now have the position of default audio source. If I go back into the Music app, I need to use the play or Shuffle buttons to start hearing music again. After I do this, I can then pause or resume playback using the magic tap from where-ever I happen to be in iOS.
    When we hold small objects, such as an iPhone, we tend to think in smaller terms. Naturally, you think of earbuds, a headset, or perhaps, a small hand-held Bluetooth speaker. However, we shouldn't limit our thinking. That small slab has tremendous potential for sharing unlimited sound. Using Bluetooth and a feature called AirPlay, your iPhone can send audio to a broad range of speakers, headsets, TVs and more. I can show up at a friend's house with my iPhone ready to tap into Bluetooth capable outdoor speakers in the backyard during a barbecue dinner. The four thousand plus songs I have onboard should last hundreds of hours if necessary. I can bring my own portable battery powered Bluetooth speaker plus a power bank containing enough juice to easily last a weekend in a small bag I carry over my shoulder. On a rainy day, I could just as easily provide movie entertainment sending the latest movies to a home theatre setup with Dolby Atmos or 5.1 digital surround sound. The technology has arrived at the stage where there's no choppy buffering or anything like that.
    For blind people who have no use for big screens, an iPhone is a splendid audio entertainment system when paired with appropriate accessories. Two HomePod Mini speakers, no larger than baseballs, serve my wife and I quite admirably from two corners of my desk in our apartment. We listen to everything from radio stations to online events to movies and audio dramas together. AirPods, or even USBC powered EarPods, offer excellent sound considering their tiny size.
    Data storage, cellular data and Wi-Fi speeds make your iPhone a fantastic device to carry audio with you while travelling. Even a 64 GB iPhone can store hundreds of hours of audio. Once you understand how to use VoiceOver and learn the conventions of iOS, you can do quite a lot with your iPhone working with audio. This holds true for recording and creating audio as well. From the basic to the very complex, there are apps which can turn your iPhone into a powerful recorder and processor.
    I very much enjoy being able to cary so much sound, which inspires me everywhere I go. From full cast audio dramas recorded in surround sound to all my favourite audiobooks, podcasts, pop and instrumental music, I'll never run out of things to listen to and share with others who are so inclined.

Privacy and Security:
These days, the selection of music, audiobooks, ebooks, apps, movies and more that you can enjoy on your iOS device is staggering. So is the amount of personal information you'll soon have stored on the device if you make good use of it. Everything from addresses and contact information to health and other data. I remember reflecting after a year with my first iPhone about how much of my personal information and other things were stored there. You don't tend to think about it in totality as you slowly start adding information, so you can do this or that more conveniently. And then, one day, it hits you. The stuff of your life is contained in a flat, light slab of high technology no thicker than a pane of window glass.
    It is also in "the Cloud", as people tend to think of it. In reality, that cloud is a bunch of theoretically secure data storage and servers where you can retrieve it whenever needed, rather than storing absolutely everything on your device itself. This reduces the amount of storage space you need to have on your device. For as long as I've owned an iOS device, I have only heard of one case where someone's iCloud was hacked.
    These devices are designed to be as light and portable as possible. They're supposed to be your digital companions at home and while on the go. They learn a lot about you. There's all the information you intentionally enter like contacts, addresses, locations important to your life, messages, and more. Beyond that, your device learns more about you as you make use of it thanks to onboard artificial intelligence. This very portability and all the information they contain makes them tempting targets for theft. It's in Apple's best interests to protect all that information from theft or abuse by others.
    This goes far beyond your personal information. Protection must also extend to making certain that other people can't steel the addresses of friends and family, books, apps, movies, and music you choose to have on your device. To this end, Apple has gone to great lengths to provide a safe and secure environment for iOS users and those who provide digital content. Many of these measures happen behind the scenes, unnoticed by users going about their lives. For instance, all apps found in the app store must be checked and approved by Apple staff, who are on the lookout for troublemakers. Incidents of malware and viruses are very rare in the iOS ecosystem. No security is foolproof, but Apple has done a superb job in that department. All data on your device and stored in iCloud is encrypted in a way that even Apple can't break. To gain access to a dead terrorist's iPhone, the FBI was forced to engage the services of a security company, who were able to hack into the iPhone at a high cost. Doing so is no trivial exercise. Apple was willing to go to court and refused to create any kind of universal back door to unlock iOS devices suspected of containing valuable information. They can, and will, help law enforcement in any way possible that doesn't reduce the security of innocent owners of their products.
    This section will focus on elements of information security over which it is possible to exercise some direct control. These include privacy settings, passwords, passcodes, and restrictions you can activate or deactivate. This may seem a bit daunting for the non-technical people who might be reading this. By its very nature, security nearly always means a degree of inconvenience. In today's world of information, having at least a basic grasp of these measures is essential for a safe and happy experience in the iOS ecosystem. Apple keeps everything pretty simple from a user's perspective. You don't need to be a technology expert to put security features to good use. What I tend to worry about the most is people who have a hard time remembering passwords or numbers. You only need a few such items to be easily remembered when asked for. However, having them easily recalled and ready to be used is absolutely vital. I would strongly urge anybody with these difficulties to keep a recording or text file handy with that information clearly written or announced. Also, provide a copy of that information to someone who you trust. That will make it much easier to resolve security issues quickly and painlessly with a minimum of inconvenience or involvement from others who might not be as trustworthy.
    Overall, I have had a very positive and safe experience with iOS. Not once have I had to contend with a virus or data theft. While I don't go out of my way to court danger, I don't hesitate to follow links to search results that point to new items of interest. Having been online for over twenty-five years, I have a pretty well-developed but not infallible sense of what's safe and what likely isn't. Were I ever to have my iPhone stolen, I would be far more annoyed at the massive immediate inconvenience this would cause than concerned about my information falling into the wrong hands. I think Apple does a good job with security. There's a balance that needs to be struck between protection and annoyance. Apple has done a good job of minimizing that annoyance while maintaining a very high level of safety.
    Some people find the thought of Apple keeping an eye on things and limiting the apps available for your device to what they approve distasteful and worrying. Personally, I'm pleased they're doing this. I have yet to be stopped from doing anything I wanted to do on my device. I have, on the other hand, been saved from having to deal with some nasty surprises people using other operating systems such as Android have found lurking on their devices.
    Some people will get these devices and then refuse to create an Apple account or use other features due to a paranoia of big bad corporations watching their every move. Honestly, if you're that concerned about big data snooping on you, save a lot of money and get an old-fashioned dumb phone or cheaper Android tablet. In fact, you could theoretically get one of each if both were on sale and still come out ahead financially. Choosing not to create an Apple account or not bother with a passcode will place drastic limitations on what you can do with your iOS device. It would be like purchasing a car and not getting brakes an engine or windshield wipers. You couldn't do much besides roll down hill on a clear day. Other than using the apps included on the device, you won't be allowed to get more apps or update the software on your device, etc. Also, any information stored on such an unsecured device would be available to anybody who got their hands on it. You're not saving time or protecting yourself from the big bad corporation. You're just being very stupid. To enjoy the benefits of an iOS device, you simply have to accept that you're entering an economy of information. You essentially make a bargain with Apple and companies whose services and software are used through your device. In exchange for some truly remarkable revolutionary capabilities, including more access to information than blind people have ever before known, you incur the risk that information about you might be stolen or used inappropriately. Either the benefits of participating in activities one uses these devices for is worth the risk to your information privacy, or it isn't. Don't shoot yourself in the foot over misplaced fear. Provided you're not doing anything criminal with an iPhone or iPad, Apple really doesn't care what you're up to. Take precautions using the security tools discussed here and enjoy what owning an iOS device will let you accomplish.
Setting up or Changing Security:
If you don't skip the steps during initial setup of your device, you'll be putting security in place while completing the overall process. The steps will be appropriate to the technology included in your particular device. At a minimum, you will be asked to create an Apple account if you don't already have one. If you're setting up a secondary device or upgrading to a new one, you should use the same Apple account. This gives you access to any personal information stored in iCloud plus apps or other things you've already purchased from Apple. For each device you own, you'll have the option to set a passcode. Next, depending on the device you have, you'll be able to set up Touch or Face ID. Apple strongly encourages the use of security features. However, it is possible to skip some of these steps during setup. This may seem like a good move while you're learning how to work with your device. However, I think it's far better for people to get used to working with the security features right from the start, so they're part of your process and don't seem as burdensome. For people with learning disabilities or difficulties remembering things, skipping the security steps might ease the initial stages of becoming proficient. You can always change your mind and turn on features later once you're more comfortable using your device. Do this as soon as possible so that you're protected and able to use the features which require that you make use of security options.
    After setup is complete, you can go into areas within the Settings app to change security. These include the first item in Settings labelled with your name, the Touch ID & Passcode area, the Privacy area, and the "Screen Time" area. Also, there is the Auto-Lock setting found in the Display & Brightness area.
Your Apple account:
In the process of setting up your device, you'll be asked to log in with an Apple account you already have or create one if it's your first device. Ideally, each customer should have one Apple account. It's your central account with Apple. When you create an Apple account, it is used to keep track of all information of your dealings with Apple. You use it in the app store when you buy apps and in Apple Books when you buy books. It's also used when making subscriptions to services like Apple Music. Any information you store in iCloud is also tied to your Apple account.
    An Apple account consists of an email address and password. It is absolutely vital that you remember these. They're your way of proving to Apple who you are. The email address should be one you actually check because there may be occasions where Apple contacts you. Also, you are sent receipts for any purchases via this address. The password you choose needs to be something you can recall, while still being hard for someone else to figure out, even if they know you. When deciding on a password, you should err on the side of it being easy for you to remember, rather than being some complex alphanumeric sequence that confounds everyone including yourself. I've spent hours failing to help people start from scratch after forgetting their password or the code they've used to lock their devices. The bottom line is that all I can do is try to help you remember your passcode and password. Beyond that, you'll need to call Apple or make use of other account recovery options I'll review below. Apple's tech support staff cannot circumvent security. While there are recovery steps, they take time and are done by a separate department. Apple would rather deny you access than risk all of your information getting into the wrong hands. Remember your Apple account and the password you picked for it. They're your ultimate key. Keep it handy and safe, like you would do for the key to your home. These devices will be like a digital home.
    When asked to enter your Apple account and password, a form will appear on-screen with separate fields for each piece of information. The email address will typically be filled in already and occupies the first field near the top of the screen. You can double tap on a field to go into Edit mode, allowing you to enter or change information. When in Edit mode, you can find the Go or Done button that should be double tapped to indicate you're finished with that field. The Delete button will be above the Shift and Go buttons near the bottom-right corner. The next field will be for your password. Enter that and then find the Go button on the bottom right when finished.
Account Recovery Options:
Depending on your security needs, you have a few choices as of iOS 15 when it comes to getting access to your account and data if you forget your Apple account and password. If you can still log into another trusted Apple device, you could simply get a verification code which you could enter on the device you're locked out of. You would then be able to verify that you're the owner of the device and regain access.
    Past that point, you'll need to use Apple's other recovery options. By default, you would be using Apple's data recovery service. This doesn't recover anything which is end-to-end encrypted, like passwords or other sensitive information. However, it will give you access to photos and other things like notes. This process involves you calling Apple and convincing the staff that you're who you say you are. This process may take days and is designed to err on the side of caution.
    A far easier process, presuming you have someone you trust implicitly, is to add them as a recovery contact. This will be of tremendous help to forgetful people. If you forget your Apple account, password, etc, you can call your contact or ask them in person for help. The person you add as a recovery contact must also have an Apple device running iOS 15 or later. They must have two-factor authentication turned on and also be using a passcode to lock their device. He or she must be 13 or over.
    To add someone as a recovery contact, go into the Apple account section at the top of Settings. It usually has your name as the title. Flick right until you get to "password and security". Next, double tap on this and then flick right to "account recovery". Double tap on this and then flick right until you find "add recovery contact". You should then double tap this and flick right. You'll be presented with some information about what a recovery contact has and the basic process. Flick right and double tap on "add recovery contact". You can then choose contacts from Apple's suggestions or add someone else entirely. Once you've selected the person, Apple will present you with a default message to send which asks them to be your recovery contact. You will be notified when they accept or decline. You can always remove recovery contacts, and they can remove you. If this happens, you'll be notified and possibly asked to pick another recovery contact.
    If you're unable to remember your password, you can call your contact or see them in person. They can then use their Apple device to get the code you'll need to recover access to your account. Once you use this code, you'll be taken through the process of deciding a new password, which you'll hopefully remember better. The recovery contact can't use the code they get for anything. It's only good for giving you access to your device. Of course, if he or she is present with you, they could overpower you and use the code to reset your password. It's up to you to pick someone you trust not to do something like that.
    For people who don't want Apple or anybody else having access to their stuff under any circumstances, there is a third option. You can create a recovery key. If you do this, Apple can no longer help you recover any information. Nor can a recovery contact. The key is a twenty-eight character combination of letters and numbers. Once you create the recovery key, you'll need it whenever you reset your password unless you have another trusted Apple device such as a second iPhone, iPad, etc. If you lose the recovery key, you lose access to everything. There's no way to get at your data without that key. I wouldn't recommend this option unless you have a good reason for using it. Keep copies of the key written down or available to access securely, or you will simply have to start from absolute scratch with a new Apple account.
Having a Passcode:
A passcode is a number or alphanumeric sequence that you can use to lock your device. It's exactly like the PIN number you need to access your bank account. Think of it as your first line of defence, or the lock on your front door. A passcode also encrypts mail messages and other data on your device, so you can only access it if you know the number. You should choose a number that you can remember easily. Apple recommends a six-digit passcode, but you're not stuck with that. During the passcode setup process, find the Passcode Options button. Using this, you may opt for an easier four-digit number or a totally customized alphanumeric code of your choosing. You are allowed to use different passcodes for different devices, which are all tied into the same Apple account. Even if you use Touch or Face ID, you'll still need to use the passcode if you restart your device or don't unlock it for a while. You can set things up so that after ten failed attempts to enter the correct passcode, all the data on your device is erased. If that happens, you'll either have to set up your device as a new one or restore from a backup. For the latter course of action, you'll definitely need to know your Apple account and password.
    Make certain you pick a number you can remember easily. This is especially important if you have things set so that everything is erased after ten failed attempts. I can't help people who are completely locked out of their device. Remember your passcode, Apple account and password. They're your keys to everything.
    To enter a passcode, input the digits using the number pad that appears on-screen. There is a Delete key near the bottom right if you make a mistake. If you touch a bit below near the top of the screen, VoiceOver will announce how many values you have entered. For instance, it might say "3 of 6". Once you've entered the correct number of digits, wait a moment. If you've entered it correctly, your device will be unlocked. If not, you'll be informed that the code was incorrect and may try again.
Touch ID:
I tend to think of my fingers as being rather average ones. However, while fingertips may feel similar, they are unique to the point of being able to serve as identification good enough for security checks and court evidence. Apple takes full advantage of this uniqueness to secure the information your device contains.
    Beneath the Home or action buttons of some iOS devices, there is a sophisticated fingerprint scanner that reads your fingerprint and unlocks your device if it matches one that you've authorized. This is what is known as "touch ID". Instead of entering your passcode to unlock your device or approve purchases all the time, you can simply touch the Home button with a finger. You can set up more than one fingerprint for Touch ID. All fingerprints are stored in a secure place on your device called a "secure enclave" that even Apple can't access. Apps and services using this data receive only pass or fail information. You can use Touch ID to approve purchases, use Apple Pay, and many other things. The chances of someone else having a fingerprint similar enough to your own is said to be one in fifty thousand.
    To set up a fingerprint, place your finger on the Home button and then lift it as VoiceOver instructs during the setup process. It will have you place and lift the finger several times, and then have you change your grip before continuing this process. This makes certain that your device has an accurate recording of your finger. When I owned an iPhone 7 which used Touch ID, I did this process for one finger on each hand for greater convenience, so I could unlock my phone using whichever hand worked better at a particular moment. When asked to use Touch ID, simply touch your finger to the Home button on your device, maintaining the contact until you hear a ding and feel a vibration. If you are inaccurate in your placement, it is possible that your finger won't be recognized, and you'll have to make another attempt. I've never had to do this more than twice to be properly recognized.
    Overall, I had a pretty good experience with Touch ID before moving onto iPhones which used Face ID. It was handy to be able to unlock your iPhone using one hand while it was still in your pocket. I could then do things without ever removing my iPhone from my pocket if necessary. For simple tasks like reading books or navigating music, this was a nice convenience. Also, it sped up things like purchasing books or apps marvellously. Instead of entering in passwords, you just touched your finger to the Home button, and your purchase was approved.
    One issue I did occasionally find annoying is that after I washed dishes or if I had wet hands, it became almost impossible to use Touch ID. Especially if your hands were in hot water. I often needed to resort to my passcode to unlock my iPhone until my hands returned to a dry state and normal temperature. Cold weather doesn't help either. You either have to remove a glove to unlock your device or have cold fingers that may not be recognized by Touch ID.
Face ID:
Being totally blind all my life, I've never seen my own reflection. Nor do I have any frame of reference for comparison. One of the first things I was asked to do while setting up my iPhone XR was show it my face. Holding the iPhone in front of me while facing straight ahead, I followed the spoken instructions that told me how to move my head. This movement allowed tiny advanced cameras and sensors mounted near the top of my iPhone to construct a highly detailed, three-dimensional digital model of my face. So highly detailed that it's good enough to be used for payment and banking apps. Thanks to infrared lasers and other sensors, the iPhone I had just brought home now knew more about my face than friends and family who had known me all my life ever could. To unlock my iPhone or approve a purchase, I would simply have to face the camera at the top of my device and click a button twice to confirm my consent. After completing the setup process, I intentionally locked my iPhone and tried using Face ID as I was instructed. It worked like a charm. Each time I used it, artificial intelligence in my iPhone learned more about how to recognize my face from different perspectives in different ambient light.
    This technology is said to be more convenient and far more secure than Touch ID. On the more high-end advanced devices such as the iPhone X or newer, a group of cameras and sensors can recognize your face, allowing it to be used instead of a passcode and Apple account. It can even tell whether you're actively paying attention, presuming you're capable of actually looking at your device. The chances are one in a million that anyone else's face will be similar enough to yours to fool Face ID. The chances are somewhat better if they're related, or you're twins. Every so often, you'll still need to use a passcode to unlock your device, such as after you restart it or if you haven't used Face ID in over forty-eight hours. The same is true for other things like approving purchases. For sighted people, it is very convenient, since they must look at their devices to use them. For blind people, it's easy to use but less convenient than Touch ID, since you need to actually face your device rather than touch the Home button while the device is in your pocket or pack.
    Apple has taken blind people into consideration when designing this security feature. If you have VoiceOver enabled, it will guide you through the setup process, telling you how to move your face, so it can be properly scanned. It will also disable the part of Face ID that looks for attentiveness so that you just need to face your device rather than look at it. This does reduce how secure Face ID is. Someone could knock you out and hold your device up to your face, for instance. However, take this in proper context. If somebody threatened you with bodily harm or worse, you'd probably much rather unlock the device for them anyhow. These things are only as secure as you are.
Setting up Face ID
There was some initial panic back when Apple introduced Face ID. However, it was completely misplaced. VoiceOver guides you through the setup process quite well. It tells you to hold the iPhone in front of your face and to rotate your face so the camera system on the front of your iPhone takes in all the details of your face. I ended up going through this process twice, having rushed through it too quickly the first time. The second time through, I heard and followed more of the instructions I should have waited for the first time. If you go too quickly, VoiceOver doesn't catch some instructions. If you aren't getting good results after your first attempt setting up Face ID, simply double tap on Reset Face ID and go through the procedure again.
    First, after double tapping Set Up Face ID, read the instructions and description of the animation that is displayed. It shows what you need to do. Next, double tap the Got It button to start the procedure.
    Hold your iPhone in portrait mode around half an arm's length away in front of your face. I get good results if the top of my iPhone is around nose level when I start. You then follow the directions to turn your face as if it were a hand on a clock face, where the iPhone is the centre of the clock. If you've never felt an analogue clock, imagine your face is the handle on a crank that turns around the iPhone you're holding in front of your face. This lets the camera see the bottom and top of your face and build a 3D digital model that is stored on your device.
    The second scan needs you to turn your face from side to side. During each scan, you'll be told how close to completion you are, and you will hear a series of beeps increasing in pitch to help determine how far along you are. After the second scan is done, you'll be told whether or not the process succeeds. Presuming it has, Face ID will be up and running.
Going Beyond Setup of Touch and Face ID:
One big advantage to using biometric information is that it's harder to steal than a password, since the information never actually leaves your iPhone. Any facial or fingerprint data is stored in a specially secure area on the specific device on which it was created called a secure enclave. When you are asked to verify your identity using these systems, the actual testing is done entirely on your device. A token is then sent to any app or service which requires this verification, which simply indicates whether or not it was a positive match.
    There are more settings in the Touch/Face ID & Passcode area. These help you determine where and when you'll be using it, rather than using your Apple account and password to verify your identity. The first heading is Use Touch/Face ID For. Beneath it, you'll find a series of toggle buttons that can be on or off. The first one will be for unlocking your device. Other choices include using Touch or Face ID when purchasing apps or other digital goods from Apple. You can also use it to verify your identity so that any passwords and credentials used on various websites can be autofilled for you. This can save a great deal of time.
    After these, you'll find a heading that will say either Fingerprints or Face. You can add additional fingerprints or remove them. After these options, you'll find options to change or turn off your passcode. You'll need to enter it before you can disable it.
    The next heading has to do with what can be accessed while locked without needing Touch or Face ID. You can always control music playback and make phone calls through using your voice. Again, there are a series of toggles for the Today view, Control Centre, Siri, etc. Towards the end of this branch of settings, you'll also find a toggle for Erase Data. This lets you choose to have data on your device erased after ten failed attempts to unlock your device with passcode or biometric options.
Passkeys:
Passwords have been around forever. Unfortunately, the more secure they are made through length and complexity, the less likely they will remain long in the minds of their creators where it's most important that they be. The major tech companies have formed an alliance in this area to come up with a solution to this longstanding problem. Passkeys are what they have arrived at. Now that most devices can have biometric authentication, or are secured by a passcode, you can verify your identity using only these things. An encryption key system only needs to know that a trusted device like your iPhone has verified your identity. The rest happens at the other end and eliminates the need to remember passwords. Even it you switch to a device from a different manufacturer, the passkey will still work because of an encryption key generated when the passkey was made. These keys are specifically created for one website or service. The key stored on the server owned by the company or service is useless without the encryption key created on your device when you made the passkey. A very high level of security is thereby matched with a high level of ease of use and convenience. For Apple users, passkeys are synched across devices using the same Apple account which are connected to iCloud. This way, you don't need to generate new passkeys when you switch to a new device. Set up Touch or Face ID and a passcode on your new device and they should work as normal. Should something ever go wrong, you can always use your password and email or other previously created credentials to log in and then create a new passkey.
    This system should really cut down on issues with people becoming locked out of their various accounts when they forgot their password. Just be certain to always remember your Apple account password and the passcode used to unlock your iPhone or other Apple product. Provided you make use of the iCloud keychain and Passwords app, you should be in excellent shape to live your digital life securely.
Two-Factor Authentication:
Designed to protect your Apple account from theft, "two-factor authentication" sends a verification code to trusted phone numbers or devices. To access your Apple account or do other potentially security-critical things, two-factor authentication means that you require information that only you theoretically know, plus something only sent to trusted devices in your possession. In this case, a randomly generated verification code that is sent to your device when required and only works for a limited time. Wait too long, and you'll need a new verification code. If a criminal has your device, he or she may see the verification code but won't know your Apple account, passcode, or password. If a new device tries to log in with your Apple account, it will be asked for a verification code. Blind people will need to memorize this six-digit code long enough to enter it correctly when required. If that number happens to be for the iPhone that has been stolen, the criminal will certainly hear or see that number. However, that's only "one" of "two" factors securing your information. They would also need your passcode, fingerprint or face, and your Apple account and password for complete access to your information. Any time a verification code is used, you will receive an email that would let you know of this occurrence. It would stop someone trying to log in via a website and cause trouble using your Apple account. They wouldn't have the verification number, and you would be alerted to the danger. If they did have the verification number on a stolen device, they wouldn't have your passcode, face, or fingerprint or other necessary information. You could then change your password or take other precautions. You can use the verification code to recover control of your Apple account and reset your password if you believe you've been compromised.
    Since only trusted devices and phone numbers can receive the verification code, you no longer need to remember the answers to security questions. You can have more than one trusted phone number or device set. Parents could have their phone number be a trusted number for their child's device. This would also be useful for people who have difficulty remembering things.
Taking Charge of Security with Settings:
For a worthwhile experience on iOS, it's vital to have a good idea how to set and manage security so that it doesn't inconvenience you unduly. The Settings area is where this management can be accomplished. Options related to security are concentrated in a few key areas of Settings. Let's begin our tour with the very first item past the Search field.
    Presuming you've set everything up and haven't skipped steps, the first item after the Search field will be labelled with your name and email address you used to create your Apple account. This is where you manage things having to do with your Apple account, password, payment information, etc. Think of this area as having to do more with your identity in the Apple marketplace rather than about securing your particular device. In the passwords and security area, you can change your password and also choose whether you want to use two-factor authentication. Unless you have major difficulties remembering a six-digit code, I strongly recommend having it turned on. This way, you can use services that require top security, like Apple Pay.
The Auto-Lock Feature:
To prevent battery drain and improve security, the Auto-Lock feature will cause an iOS device to lock itself after a short period of inactivity. This setting can be found in the Display & Brightness area of settings. You can set it between 30 seconds and 5 minutes, or set it to Never. Normally, I have it set to never lock automatically. It gets annoying having to unlock your phone to continue doing something after merely pausing for a moment's thought. It won't suddenly lock while you're reading an ebook or typing, since the cursor is constantly scrolling while that happens. However, if you're listening to a podcast or audiobook, your iPhone will lock itself. As long as you're actively doing things or contents of the screen are actively changing, the auto-lock won't inconvenience you. I'd use auto-lock if I felt at all nervous that my iPhone might be stolen or misplaced. That way, there would only be a short time before your device locked itself and required your fingerprint, face, or passcode to be used.
The Screen Curtain:
To help protect your privacy, VoiceOver contains a feature called "screen curtain". Since anybody using VoiceOver is likely to be totally blind and not looking at the screen, you can invoke this feature to make certain nobody else can see what you're doing without you knowing this. It will cause your screen to be blank. This doesn't save battery power, so you'll still need to reduce display brightness to achieve that. I have the display brightness set to 0% and maximize my battery life. However, you may be in a situation where you often want sighted people to be able to assist. In that case, having brightness set to around 30% or lower might be a good compromise. I don't mind having to go into the Control Centre and raise the brightness on those rare occasions I want sighted people to see what's on my screen. You turn "screen curtain" on or off by tapping three times quickly with three fingers. A three-finger triple tap.
Privacy and Security Settings:
Privacy and security settings are used to allow or prevent access to the information on your iPhone by people or various apps. For instance, you might choose to prevent an app from accessing the microphone or camera or from accessing your social media accounts.
    In the Settings app, you'll find the Privacy and security button just past the Emergency SOS button and before the Game Centre button. These are all past the General button.
    This area of settings has been updated and streamlined since the first edition of this guide was released. Apple has doubled down on its bet that users of its products value their privacy. Apps must ask permission to track you to personalize advertisements, among many other things. You can deny permission to track your location, website use, and other things at any time. Options having to do with specific social media platforms have been taken away, since these are now redundant by the control you presently have over what data apps are allowed to collect about you.
    The first group of buttons in this area each give you control over whether apps can access capabilities or information present in your device, which they may or may not require to function properly. Before being able to access this, apps you install and run for the first time will request various permissions to do so. No such decision is carved in stone. You can also double tap on any of these buttons and then change the permission granted to the apps which have requested it. In each case, you'll first find a master switch to give a default position or global decision for that category. After that, flicking right will reveal more granular choices for allowing or disallowing individual apps which have requested access to a given capability or information source.
    Location services comes first. Double tap this button, and you'll gain access to the master switch to turn off location services entirely if you wish not to be tracked at all. I don't recommend this unless there are exceptional circumstances. Instead, I recommend using the settings you'll find by flicking right through this category to disallow apps which have requested location information which you don't wish to have it. There are many very helpful uses for your location, including providing travel directions, local weather information, better network connectivity, and many others.
    Tracking is the next setting. This has to do with whether apps can track your online activity across websites and domains. This is most often used to provide companies information about your interests and let them send more relevant advertising to you. Turning the master switch off in this area will cause iOS to automatically deny any requests which apps make to do this. Normally, you would be presented with such requests and could decide at the time to allow or deny permission. I've decided not to turn off the master switch and deal with the requests as they come. There are apps such as news, weather and even some shopping apps like Uber Eats which I have allowed to track me. This results in news apps being better aware of my areas of interest. I also receive more applicable deals from shopping apps like Uber Eats, which have actually saved me money. However, I've chosen to disallow FaceBook from tracking me. Although I still use Facebook, I don't feel that this company has earned the right to any more information than is necessary.
    The next series of buttons in Privacy settings give you the ability to decide which apps can access information such as Contacts, calendar, reminders, and photos. Many apps will make use of this information to help you socialize, keep organized, etc. As always, you can deny access to any app you want to avoid having this information.
    Past that, you'll find more network and communication related areas including Bluetooth, local network, microphone, speech recognition, and camera. As always, there are many legitimate and helpful reasons for apps to access these things. Social apps use your microphone and camera to allow you to communicate with others using the same app. Many apps helpful to blind people need access to the camera and photos to describe objects and scenes, or let sighted people help from a distance.
    The next group of buttons provide access to more varied areas such as health data, research sensor and usage data, HomeKit, media and Apple Music, files and folders, motion and fitness, and focus information. That last one has to do with the focus setting you're in. This lets apps know this and perhaps send a message informing someone trying to contact you that you're sleeping or don't wish to be disturbed.
    Past these settings, you'll find a line explaining that information will be added to the above categories as apps request it.
    The journaling suggestions button lets you decide which apps may be watched by artificial intelligence on your iPhone to generate suggestions for you to write about. This is perfectly safe, but for people wanting to limit access to their information, the option is there.
    Safety Check is a new addition to your suite of security tools, which was added in iOS 16. It is used to help you be aware of and quickly manage which people, services, and apps have access to data that you share. Developed in consultation with organizations who help women who have suffered abuse and stalking, Apple has endeavoured to make it possible to quickly block access to your data if a relationship turns dangerous. If a dangerous person enters your presence while you're doing this, it is always possible to quickly get out of the safety check and security settings and back onto a home screen if necessary so they don't realize you're taking that step. The check has an option to quickly reset all sharing permissions so that only your device can access the data. You might want to do this if you've left an unsafe place and have a moment where you're not in physical danger and are unobserved. There is also an option to go through a more methodical procedure of reviewing who and what has access to your data. It will also cover your overall account security. Just go through each step and follow any instructions which make sense in your situation. For more in depth instructions, please refer to the "learn more" link found immediately upon entering the safety check area. There are checklists and extensive resources available in a downloadable PDF.
    The next item is a feature which checks any images you are about to view on your iPhone for graphic or explicit content, such as nudity. It uses artificial intelligence on your iPhone and doesn't share anything with Apple. It will warn you in advance so that you can make sensible decisions about what you expose yourself to. This may be of use to blind parents seeking peace of mind on that front regarding what imagery their children might see while using iPhones set up for family members.
    There are some buttons which deal with Apple's ability to advertise to you and to analyze activity on your iPhone to improve the overall experience. I don't have a problem with this, and hope my data will help app developers and Apple fine-tune things in future iOS updates.
    There are a couple of buttons under a heading called transparency logs. These are Apple Intelligence report and "app privacy report". Both of these buttons present you with information about when apps make use of the information you've given permission for. Regarding Apple Intelligence, this gives you a sense of the information being used on your behalf to accomplish things for you. Meanwhile, the app privacy report includes what information was requested, as well as which websites or domains were used by apps. The information is quite extensive and should allow you to make informed decisions about which apps you trust and use. If you wish, you can always find the option to turn off this reporting at the very end of the settings. If this is turned off, you'll find a button to turn on the app privacy report. The same is true for the AppleIntelligence report. I recommend leaving these turned on and checking every so often to determine whether you are happy with how the apps you make use of are dealing with your information.
    Beneath a heading called "Security" near the very bottom of this area of settings, there are two final options to discuss. The first is called Stolen Device Protection. The basic idea is to thwart anybody who might get hold of your device and have somehow found out your passcode. Perhaps, they watched you enter it surreptitiously and grabbed it while it was unattended. In such an event, this option will require the use of Face or Touch ID before allowing a range of critical actions to take place. It will also impose an hour's delay before making any changes to security critical settings or passwords. You can have this requirement waived when you're in trusted locations, such as at home or work. Alternatively, you can have the extra safety measures applied regardless of location.
    Under normal circumstances, a failed check for Face or Touch ID would result in an immediate ask for your passcode to complete whatever you were trying to do. For example, I make use of my banking app and have it check for my Face ID to log into my account. Occasionally, I'm not quite looking the right way, or the lighting is poor. The Face ID check will fail and I'll then be asked for my passcode. If Stolen Device Protection is turned on, I would have to close the app and make another attempt to pass the Face ID check. I couldn't simply enter my passcode. This also protects your credit cards from being used without a successful Face or Touch ID check.
    Personally, I've had occasions where this protection is frankly inconvenient. I'm not always conscious of the lighting conditions or if I'm facing the camera quite as directly as I should be. This has resulted in some occasions when I've had to wait to make changes until I had passed a Face ID check. Given my ordinary circumstances, I have chosen to leave this turned off. However, if I'm travelling in less safe conditions, I would certainly turn it on. Sometimes, it's just a lot more convenient for blind people to be able to fall back to their passcode. Remember that you can always change your passcode if you want. Just make certain it's one you'll remember.
    Lockdown mode is the final option in these settings. Using this option should only be done if you're under direct personal threat from sophisticated hackers because of who you are or what you do. This isn't made for the ordinary everyday iPhone user. It will introduce major inconveniences and cripple some aspects of your iPhone to protect you. Please review the information found in the "learn more" link made available when you double tap on the Lockdown Mode option before you turn it on.
Advanced Data Protection:
This setting can be found in the iCloud settings which are located in your Apple Account settings. It's the area labelled with your name and picture at the very top of Settings. Basically, advanced data protection encrypts all information stored in iCloud using a very high level of encryption. If you make use of this, Apple will not be able to help you recover any information if you become locked out of your account. Because of this, you will need to have set up a recovery contact or recovery key before turning on this feature. I don't recommend that beginners use this option until they are very comfortable with VoiceOver and competent in general with their iPhone over all. If you lose your recovery key or your recovery contact is unavailable, you won't be able to get into your account unless you can remember your password and passcode. If advanced data protection is off, Apple staff will be able to be of some assistance once they're certain you're the owner of the iPhone you're locked out of. I've encountered people who would be absolutely out of luck having forgotten their Apple account password, passcode, etc. Nobody would have been able to help them regain access had they turned on this feature. Think carefully before you do so. As always, avail yourself of the information in the "learn more" link found when you double tap on this option before activating it.
Thoughts on Privacy Settings:
Overall, I don't spend a lot of time worrying about privacy. Having owned an iPhone and hundreds of apps for over a decade, I have yet to find that permission I've given to apps and companies has caused me any problem or put me at a disadvantage. Most typically, I tend to give apps permission to use the information or capabilities they request. I don't tend to adjust these settings frequently. IOS asks you as soon as an app requests access to these services, so I don't need to go into the Privacy area unless I change my mind from my initial decision about what access an app should have. That happens from time to time.
    I mainly prefer apps to only use Location Services when I'm actually using them, so I've adjusted those settings the most. Other than that, most of my privacy settings remain unchanged. I very much approve of the new tougher stance Apple has taken on transparency when it comes to what information apps are allowed to use. It's nice to have the tools to only share data with apps and services you truly value and support, or which provide you enough benefit to justify sharing of data. This should help raise the bar for advertising and apps which make their money from that rather than directly from their users.
Screen Time and Restrictions:
Restrictions are used to prevent actions from being taken without your permission on your iOS device. You can use these to prevent children from making purchases while they use your iPad to play a game. You can also prevent people from browsing the Web or using Apple Books, among many other things. This can give you peace of mind if you allow someone else to use your device that they can't do anything potentially harmful to you.
    Apple has recently consolidated all such options into the Screen Time settings area. This puts all the tools available to manage what people can do with your device under one digital roof. To manage Restrictions, go into the Screen Time area. This button can be found to the left of "General". The first thing you'll encounter is information about your recent activity. Flick right past all of that information. You'll be at the end when it says "updated" followed by the most recent time this has happened.
    Past this, you'll be inside the area where you can start to set restrictions. The first group has to do with setting time limits based on communications with people and with how long or whether apps can be used at various times. This was the original reason for Screen Time. It was all about making you aware of how much time you spent doing things on your iPhone and giving you the ability to restrict activities and thereby deal with digital addiction. Flicking right, you'll eventually come to a button called "Always allowed". This gives you a category to place apps in which makes them allowed to be used at all times even if other apps in the same category would normally fall under restrictions.
    The "content and privacy restrictions" button comes next. These are turned off by default. If you wish, you can prevent restrictions and other Screen Time settings from being changed by protecting the settings with a four-digit Restriction passcode. The option to set this passcode is found immediately past the "Content and privacy restrictions" button. Choose a four-digit number you'll remember. You'll need to enter it a second time to confirm. Once that's done, you'll need to know that code to disable Restrictions. The only other way to get rid of the Restrictions would be to use your Apple account and password to then be able to reset and deactivate the passcode.
    Double tapping the "Content and Privacy restrictions" button puts you into the branch containing these. The first button in this area is a master on/off switch. This lets you turn off restrictions all at once, leaving your particular set of restrictions ready to be reactivated with the same toggle. The next button is for restricting iTunes and app store purchases. These settings give you quite a lot of control here. You can require passwords all the time or only occasionally. You can disallow installing, deleting and downloading of apps. Not only that, but you can also disallow in-app purchases. This means that a child, for instance, wouldn't be able to spend your real money buying advantages in a game.
    The "allowed apps" button lets you allow or disallow a bunch of major applications on your device. You can, for instance, disallow the use of your digital wallet or the Safari browser. If disallowed, the app in question won't even appear on your screen until you turn off the restriction or use a passcode to bypass it.
    The next button is "Content restrictions". This lets you restrict inappropriate content from your device so that it's safer for a child to use. For instance, the first button lets you choose whether to allow explicit content in podcasts, news, workouts, and music to be allowed or not. There's a separate button for whether to allow music videos. Another button deals with movies. If you double tap this, you can select the rating of movies that can be viewed on your iOS device. You can specify which country's ratings you want to use. It defaults to US.
    All sorts of different kinds of content can have restrictions placed upon its consumption. Everything from podcasts, to books, to music, to news. You don't always have a lot of flexibility. Choices are more often between allowing everything or disallowing things entirely. For instance, you can restrict explicit content in books so that your child won't even come across books featuring such material. However, you can't do more complex things like eliminate violence or taboo topics. Websites are similar. You can restrict explicit adult content or only allow visits to certain sites you approve of. For apps, you can restrict apps by their age-appropriate ratings. Using these restrictions, parents could make their children's iOS devices quite safe while still allowing for some exploration on their part. Without knowing the four-digit passcode, they may not even see what they're not allowed to access.
    The settings under the Privacy heading within the "Content and Privacy" area of Screen Time are the same as the ones in the Privacy area of Settings. However, if you use the settings within the Screen Time area, you can lock them in place with the Screen Time four digit passcode. The restrictions will be in effect unless you use that passcode to change them, even if your privacy settings are different outside Screen Time.
    The "Allow Changes" heading is another important area. Beneath it are seven buttons that deal with significant areas and give you the power to disallow any changes that might cost money or compromise safety. For instance, you can use the Accounts restriction to prevent any changes being made to account information. This prevents anybody from adding a new user account to your iOS device to get around restrictions. Other areas include Cellular Data, Volume Limit, Background App Refresh, and TV Provider. A change in cellular data, for instance, might result in you inadvertently using expensive cellular data for things that you didn't want to be able to.
    The settings under the Game Centre heading allow you to restrict things like adding friends or playing multiplayer games. This will be especially useful for parents who don't feel their children are ready to deal responsibly with this unsupervised contact with strangers. There are three settings here. You can disallow playing multiplayer games entirely. You can disallow adding new friends. Lastly, you can disallow screen recording. Screen recording is often used in games to share proof of noteworthy accomplishment or other information during group play. However, it could also reveal sensitive information if used carelessly.
Passwords & Accounts:
Another feature that tries to make security a little more convenient is called iCloud Keychain. This keeps track of any passwords for various apps and websites you might use. They are stored in iCloud, so they won't be lost even if your device is. Instead of having to enter all of that information, which may be unique for each app or website, you can use your Face ID or Touch ID, or passcode to prove who you are. You will then have the needed information filled into the login form in the correct places. This drastically speeds up signing in. You can change or delete information stored in the "keychain" using the Passwords & Accounts area of Settings. You'll need to verify your identity before making changes in here.
    Recently, Apple has improved this Keychain feature. It will make certain that you don't forget to save a username along with a password. Also, you can add notes to entries, such as security question information or other details you might need. This should be helpful for people who can't remember security details well, provided they can use Face and Touch ID as needed.
The Passwords App:
New to iOS 18, the Passwords app makes managing your various passkeys, passwords and accounts a lot easier. Instead of going into settings, use the Passwords app. You'll always need to use Touch ID, Face ID, or your passcode to gain entry to this app. Once inside, you can browse through and search for any passwords, passkeys, saved verification codes, Wi-Fi information or security related information stored in your iCloud keychain. You can also share this information with other trusted people who might need it.
    The app has a very simple interface. There are buttons to search in various categories like passcodes, passwords, etc. You can double tap on one of these buttons or make use of a search box to find what you require. Once you've found the entry of interest, double tap on it. At this point, you can flick left or over the various information, You can also flick up or down to get a series of actions. These let you share the information, reveal it so you can read it, copy it directly to your clipboard, and share the information with someone. Take time to review the information on the various screens and you'll find the Passwords app a very handy feature.
Sign in with Apple:
Many of us want to use social media, search engines, and other online services. However, we worry that we'll then have our online activities tracked, be targeted for ads we don't want, or that our data will be mined. A new feature introduced in iOS 13, "Sign in with Apple" lets you forego using Facebook, Google, or other commercial services to easily log into various websites.
    Facebook and Google certainly provide a convenient and popular identity verification service. However, they are motivated to get as much data from their users as legally possible. This is what they sell to advertisers, and how you in effect pay for convenience with privacy. Instead, you can use Apple. Their motivation is keeping your data and privacy as secure as possible. They don't make money from targeted advertising except in clearly defined circumstances that they inform their users about. They make their money through your buying their devices and using their services. The less annoyed by advertising you are while using their stuff, the better you're likely to think of Apple.
    If you use this feature, Apple will create an email and password for you. As long as you have your device, all you'll need is Face or Touch ID to log into services you've chosen to use "Sign in with Apple" to create accounts with. Any communications to the fake email created for you will be forwarded to your actual email unless or until you don't want them anymore. You can then simply stop these communications from being forwarded and be left untracked and in peace.
Additional Defensive Measures:
One addition to iOS 15 was something called iCloud private Relay. This is available for people who subscribe to Apple's iCloud Plus service. It will act as a sort of VPN and prevent your web browsing from being tracked. All data coming in and out of your browser will go through Apple's iCloud server, thereby disguising your location and other identifying details. You may encounter problems if you use it but need to access websites which require things like your location to work correctly or verify who you are.
    A more established, similar thing can be done with VPN networks and devices. If you have one of these services, look in the General settings area for the "VPN" button. This will provide you with options to make use of these networks and devices. I have absolutely no experience with these, and must leave it to my readers to delve into this area if they feel the need.
    There are many other steps you can take to guard your information and privacy. One place to seek additional options would be in the Safari settings. Your web browser is one of the most powerful tools on your device. This power comes with responsibility. Many people have gotten into serious trouble by going to websites run by bad actors and thieves. The iOS operating system does its best to warn you if things seem suspicious, but it's a constant arms race between them and the unscrupulous hackers, making the web a more dangerous place. You'll need to keep aware of the dangers and make decisions regarding how convenient things are versus how secure you want to be. It's a bit of a balancing act.
Parting Thoughts on Security:
I would encourage all of my readers to consult the various sections of the user guide for your specific device. There can be differences depending on the age and type of device, especially when it comes to biometric security measures. Regardless of which device you have, there will be many ways to keep your information safe. This is an important aspect of owning an iOS device. If people are careless with the information stored in their devices, it can put you and your contacts in danger of fraud and other consequences. Please use reasonable precautions.
    Remember that good security comes as much down to good habits as it does to any of the settings discussed above. Think about where you and your device are. If you're in the open, perhaps making certain your screen curtain is on before entering your banking password might be wise. Are people close enough for you to hear and understand what they're saying? They may be close enough to see and hear what your device is saying and doing. How are you currently connected to the Internet? Think about whether you want to make purchases or do other potentially sensitive things while connected to free, public, possibly insecure Wi-Fi. There are all sorts of little habits and tricks you can use to increase your overall security.
    In most cases, apps where information is stored allow you to lock that information, making it necessary to use a password or Touch or Face ID to access information. A good example of this can be found in the Notes app. If it suits you, a note that contains information of a sensitive nature can be encrypted, requiring your fingerprint, face, passcode, or password to unlock it.
    Another thing to consider, as blind users, is that your device announces things whenever you use it and sometimes, while it's in your pocket. A great deal of what gets spoken aloud while you may not be wearing EarPods or other headsets is due to Notifications. You can set them to be delivered quietly, so they appear in the Notifications Centre but aren't spoken aloud. As a kind of middle ground, you can have a sound play when a new notification arrives for a given app. In fact, many apps come with their own unique sounds for this very purpose. Look in the Notifications settings and take advantage of those options. Not all notifications should be spoken aloud upon arrival. You can also disable the ability to access the Notifications Centre from the lock screen, requiring your device to be unlocked before gaining access to notifications. This is less convenient but more secure. Adjust this sort of thing if you're going into potentially troublesome environments. You can always adjust such settings back to more convenient options when back in safer conditions.
    If you need to unlock your device or enter a password while not waring EarPods or other headsets, you can minimize the chances of people easily overhearing that information. For instance, if you're using "touch typing", run your finger intentionally over wrong numbers and letters, only lifting it when you reach the correct next item to enter. If you're using the default "standard typing", you can safely touch as many wrong numbers or letters as you like, only tapping twice quickly on the correct ones which will then actually be entered. It will be harder for any unwanted observers to tell exactly which letter or number is correct when you get good enough at this. Hold your device facing you below head level. After all, you don't need to see it yourself. This way, it'll be harder for people to know what's being entered and precisely where your active finger is when you actually enter things.
    Apple has a section in the user guides for its iOS devices called Privacy & Security. Anyone who has any concerns about security should give this nicely written section a read. Apple does a much better job than I at going through the array of tools at your disposal to guard your information. You need not be an expert to understand this and will be able to make informed choices, finding the right balance for you between security and convenience.
    On the other side of the coin, don't use extra security you don't really need. I can't count the number of people I've been powerless to help because they've set Restrictions and then forgotten the four-digit code. They'll disallow Safari and then wonder where their web browser went. They'll want to purchase an app or an in-app purchase, but discover that they've restricted that ability on their iPhone and then forgotten their code and can't disable the Restriction. I've even had one fellow restrict his GPS app from using Location Services. I wish I was joking there, but I'm sadly not. There's simply no point of having a GPS app to help you get around if you prevent it from knowing where you are. People do some really stupid things, getting all paranoid and hung up on security and privacy concerns. Take reasonable precautions, but don't go overboard with this stuff.

Braille on iOS Devices
I'm part of a generation who has learned Braille naturally as part of my school experience, while there was really no other credible alternative. However, we have now been liberated from the cost, bulk, and weight of Braille by the advent of synthetic speech and more widespread accessibility to mainstream ebooks and computing. In everyday life, now that I know how to read, I haven't felt the need to constantly use Braille. Quite the opposite, in fact. While reading for entertainment and even when referring to books as references, speech output has proved more than sufficient and ever so convenient.
    While I can fully appreciate why one might think Braille was no longer needed, I would contend that mastering the art of reading is essential to everyone's education, be that print or Braille. If sighted parents faced the prospect of their children not being taught to read and write due to a lack of resources, they'd be horrified and never stand for it. Parents of blind children should feel no qualms about insisting on Braille literacy. The many lessons I learned while gaining literacy have served me well in countless ways. Like riding a bicycle, literacy is one of those things you never forget, even if you don't read Braille beyond signs and labels for years. The lessons it teaches about proper use of punctuation, sentence structure, and other aspects of writing have stayed with me. As a result, I have been able to use my writing and language skills to help others and express my thoughts clearly and with confidence.
    I was never a particularly fast Braille reader, and don't feel I've lost what speed I achieved. The same applies to writing. I'm far faster on a QWERTY keyboard than I ever was on a Braille one. In most circumstances, text-to-speech access has proved far superior regarding portability and actual access to books. Other than my spelling having deteriorated over the years, I don't feel that the absence of Braille has done me much harm. And yet, I'm profoundly thankful that I was taught Braille reading and writing. The lack of actual literacy would have had a strongly negative impact on my quality of life. Now that you have and idea where I sit in the great Braille debate, let's continue.
    Who would have thought that a device with a smooth surface might prove to be a wonderful conduit for Braille? Apparently, Apple did. Right from the start, when VoiceOver first appeared, there has been support for Braille displays. I never thought much about it when I got my iPhone 4. It was so intuitive and easy to use speech, and the capabilities of the platform made learning how to use Braille on it far less attractive than it would be currently. Before embarking on writing this guide, I hadn't given the implications a lot of thought. As I've taken the time to dig into what iOS offers in terms of Braille support, the implications become very apparent. Unfortunately, it has also become apparent that Braille is a part of iOS which is the most prone to having bugs and serious issues remain unaddressed for long periods of time. I address this in a subsection below called Always A Catch. I recommend anybody who is considering using Braille with iOS read this before making any purchases.
    You may wonder why I've chosen to give the Braille experience its own somewhat lengthy section. I have several reasons for doing this. First of all, if people don't intend to use Braille displays, all the extra commands are out of their way. Those who wish to learn how to use refreshable Braille will find all they need in this section that isn't covered elsewhere. Experiencing iOS through a refreshable Braille display is markedly different from via the touchscreen and speech output. Rather than a whole screen surface that can be explored with a finger plus immediate speech feedback, using a Braille display may change your approach. You can explore the screen similarly with one hand operating the iOS device and another on the Braille display. Alternatively, you could operate entirely from the Braille display, using all the key commands to navigate. That will feel very different and be more similar to using a traditional screen reader. People who struggle with using a touchscreen may well find this mode of operation to be preferable. In either case, you will find that the Braille display gives you a window in the form of a line of characters whose length depends on that of your display. The position in exact focus, such as the current character in a document being written, is shown by one or two dots on the bottom of the cell that tick up and down repeatedly.
    Another advantage to separating the Braille-specific information in this way is that people can more easily grasp how much support there is and how integral Braille can be if you wish or need it to. Those who might think to presume that Apple has paid mere lip service to Braille support do Apple and themselves a serious injustice. There's a lot of ground to cover, so let's begin connecting the dots.
    Over time, Apple has gone to considerable lengths to support the use of refreshable Braille with its devices. In fact, it's possible to purchase a Braille display from the Apple Store app for your iOS device. If you already have a Braille display or a Braille notetaker capable of being used as a display and connecting via Bluetooth, you can pair it with your iOS device. VoiceOver has been designed to allow complete access via Braille throughout the operating system. While you can't completely avoid using the touchscreen, you can certainly minimize the need to. Doing this requires the learning of commands, making use of key combinations or other buttons that your Braille display may have.
    iOS has support that allows far more than simple Braille input and output. Similar to an ordinary Bluetooth keyboard, you can take full control of your device using only your Braille display. There are key commands to do everything you can do with gestures. If you can memorize the commands, you could have excellent and accurate control of your device. This includes things like summoning Siri, controlling the volume, and much more, all without lifting your fingers from your Braille display.
    The catch is that there are a heaping ton of commands to know if you want that kind of complete control. People may find that these commands feel less intuitive and easy to learn than the touchscreen gestures they are designed to replace. Personally, I find a middle of the road approach works best, where I still use the onscreen gestures but learn the commands of particular use to me.
Bye-bye Braille Book Bulk:
Ebook sellers are starting to get onboard, making certain that the apps everyone uses to read them offer support for accessibility. What this means for someone with an iOS device and Braille display is that they are completely liberated in their choice of reading. Braille books used to take hours and hours to translate and be very costly to produce. They also used to weigh quite a bit and take up a lot of space. I can still remember a vest pocket dictionary which took up an entire shelf in my grade school classroom. It comprised seven massive hardcover volumes of double-sided Braille. Now, that same dictionary would take up a tiny fraction of the data storage available on even the cheapest iPhone. A Braille display that you could comfortably carry in one hand would let you access that dictionary and thousands of other books on your iPhone in perfectly readable and translated Braille.
    One thing to keep in mind is that the apps you'll use to read these books are designed for people who can see. They're fully accessible, but things are done in such a way as to maximize reading pleasure for people who can take in a lot of a page at once. Current Braille displays only present one line of text at a time. There may occasionally be slight problems as the apps and book formats are updated over time. Moreover, it may be easier to use the touchscreen when accessing menus and other functions that reading apps have. For instance, it's far quicker to learn the locations of tabs across the bottom of the screen or use menus that appear when you double tap on the screen. In exchange for putting up with these small issues, you can read damned near anything you want as soon as it's published and at the same cost as anybody else who buys an ebook.
Always a Catch:
There are some possible trouble spots for those who choose to acquire a Braille display and iOS device rather than opt for a more traditional Braille notetaker or other solution made especially for blind people. Very significant difficulties which would need to be addressed right away if they happened to ordinary users of these devices have a way of persisting for Braille users. There are likely several reasons for this. A major one would be the comparatively small number of Braille users and the even smaller number from that group who take the time to report their issues. In order for bugs to be fixed, they need to be easily reproduced by Apple staff who work on them. This requires that people who report bugs take the time to give the most information possible about when they experience them and what they were doing when it happened. The more heavily you rely on Braille, the more grave the issues you face may be. I mostly use my iPhone via text to speech output provided by VoiceOver. This requires no external hardware of any complexity. However, with Braille output, everything needs to be translated back and forth from print to Braille on the fly as it travels to and from the Braille display being used. There are many Braille displays which may have their own differences in function that Apple must consider in order to support them.
    Since there are so many different displays, you run into the situation where bugs which affect some displays won't even be noticed on others. There's also the question of what users choose to do with Braille versus what they do with text to speech. Someone who is deaf blind relies totally on Braille for absolutely everything they do on their iPhone. They have no other option short of having someone else do things for them and communicate the results. If they experience a disconnection between their Braille display and iPhone, that effectively renders both devices useless until the connectivity can be restored. Other long-standing issues which thankfully now seem to be fixed involve lost input from displays or things working very slowly. Again, these are crippling issues for anyone who relies on being able to communicate with their devices using Braille input. To help with connectivity, there is now a setting in VoiceOver which forces Bluetooth to be turned on whenever VoiceOver is started. This would certainly eliminate one possible reason for loss of connection.
    One way which I've seen recommended to get around some freezing and lockups currently plaguing Braille users of iOS involves turning off Braille messages. These are notifications from apps which typically interrupt what the user is doing. In Braille, these take priority and the reader is pulled out of what he or she is doing. The notification is available to be read for a given period of time before the user is returned to what he or she was doing previously. Turning off these notifications essentially means that Braille users won't be informed of possibly critical warnings or messages from others which may be time-sensitive. It's one thing to miss a notification from a game being played. Quite another to miss a warning that a fire alarm might be going off or that a ride to a critical appointment is waiting.
    News typically spreads quickly, as people find out the hard way about issues with Braille. However, it is often too little too late to allow people to forego updating to what should by all rights be a better experience. Mistakes like that do cost Apple in terms of bad publicity. It can take months and further small iOS updates before problems with Braille support are largely fixed. Meanwhile, Smaller updates will be pushed out rapidly to deal with security and other issues that effected a larger portion of Apple's user base. Each time one of these appeared, you'd wonder whether the Braille display issue making your life miserable would be fixed and discover that yet again, it hadn't. This can be very frustrating, and it's tough even for me to keep from losing my generally patient and largely grateful outlook on behalf of those who truly rely on it working.
    Not being a frequent Braille user, the display issues discussed above didn't affect me to the point of holding off getting updates. For some months, it became very annoying to try to read an ebook using my Braille display because of an issue with scrolling to the next page. You'd be reading along and suddenly realize that a substantial chunk of a page had been skipped over. You'd have to backtrack to the top of the page and then continue reading from the correct spot. I could simply choose to read books using VoiceOver with its synthetic speech, which worked perfectly fine. Had I been a deaf-blind user who relied on his Braille display working reliably to communicate with others, it would have been a showstopper. Because Braille is a secondary tool for me, I don't experience these issues in the same way. If my Braille display becomes disconnected, I can simply turn speech on and sort out the situation. If there's a problem with input, I can simply use a Bluetooth keyboard. The missed messages would potentially affect me negatively if I happened to be reading or have text to speech turned off. However, that's a rare circumstance for me which I can take steps to mitigate.
    I mainly use Braille for reading books and notes during presentations. Even with this more limited use, I have experienced occasional disconnections plus other issues involving the reading cursor not keeping its proper place when pages in an ebook are turned. This latter issue was very vexing and essentially stopped me from being able to enjoyably read books using Braille for months until the issue was eventually thankfully resolved. Issues may also be due to how third-party apps interact with VoiceOver. This can add a further layer of complexity which effects how often issues appear and how easy they are to reproduce reliably.
    There may be times when your Braille display will disconnect, since the Bluetooth software is constantly trying to save battery power. If this happens, simply lock the screen with the power button on your device and then unlock it again. This should result in your display reconnecting. Some displays can be more problematic and require more steps to get them reconnected. This kind of thing also happens with other Bluetooth devices, such as keyboards or even Apple's own AirPods. The AirPods are designed to reconnect rapidly and do so automatically nearly all the time. There are so many different Braille displays that having the same kind of Bluetooth reliability would be impossible. This is very similar to my having to press a button on my Shokz Trekz Titaniums to make them reconnect if I stop hearing things through them.
    There is now a setting in the VoiceOver Braille settings area which makes certain that Bluetooth is enabled whenever VoiceOver starts. This will at least eliminate the possibility of Bluetooth being disabled when measures to reestablish a dropped connection with a previously paired display are attempted. This should make things somewhat more reliable for deaf blind users. Turning VoiceOver off and then back on again should make recovering connectivity much less complicated.
    We saw an instance of another potentially major pitfall when iOS 11 was released. People who updated suddenly found that they couldn't enter text quickly on Braille displays. Words would simply be lost and not be recorded in the document or edit field on the iOS device. Because people's fingers were busy typing in Braille, they couldn't immediately realize there was a problem if they weren't also using speech. You can't read Braille while you're in the act of typing it. Muting speech while using a Braille display is a very common practice. The issue was reported by testers but not addressed prior to the release of the update. Braille display users would be a minimal percentage of the overall number of users of iOS. Every so often, their issues won't be dealt with in time and may take a while to address.
    iOS is a very complex operating system. The more unusual your particular needs are, the higher the chance that concerns like the examples above will be encountered for hopefully short periods of time. Apple has learned from these mistakes and has introduced public testing of upcoming iOS updates in an attempt to catch major issues.
    When looking for pitfalls, I spent some time putting myself in the worst possible case. For people who are deaf-blind, Braille had better work because there's no other way. If you absolutely can't hear speech or see enlarged print, touch is your only pipeline of information. In such circumstances, you may well want to seek alternatives or have a backup plan such as sighted assistance if things go wrong.
    There are some things that might require sighted assistance to resolve. Certainly, you'd need such help to set up your device and then connect your Braille display initially. I don't believe there's any way to get at the Braille settings in VoiceOver until after the setup process is complete. Another thing that might be troublesome at first is entering your passcode to unlock your device. Some Braille displays require the iPHONE to be unlocked before they will connect and let you type characters using them. Mine didn't, so I had to enter it using standard typing mode on the touchscreen. I had one hand on the Braille display, feeling which number was highlighted, as I used my other hand to find and then enter the numbers using the split tap method. This is the best way I've found for making certain you enter the passcode correctly. You can, of course, find the delete key at the bottom right of the virtual number pad on the touchscreen and get rid of mistakes. I found this process somewhat nerve-racking without speech output, but I think it would become second nature after a while. There's really no avoiding the need to enter the passcode every so often and after any time you shut down and turn on the device. Once that's been done, you can then use easier methods to unlock your device most of the time, like Touch ID or Face ID.
    While Braille focus will jump to where new messages are displayed, other things such as choices or controls may need to be more actively searched for by Braille users. Everything will be reachable, but without such proactive exploration on your part, you might not realize there are choices or controls present in some apps. The ability to actively explore the screen is a key part of iOS accessibility that works differently from other screen readers that may look for and announce more things automatically.
Mainstream Economics and Wider Horizons:
There are several advantages that iOS devices bring to the table for blind people wanting to make use of Braille in daily life. Braille notetakers work extremely reliably and typically have excellent battery longevity. However, they are also very limited in what they can do. They offer a set number of highly perfected functions that work flawlessly, but they don't offer much ability to grow beyond those. On the other hand, iOS gives you good but sometimes imperfect access to an ever expanding ecosystem of apps, ebook markets, and other things available to sighted people. Even though only a fraction of the total apps available for iOS are accessible to blind people, that still far surpasses anything you'll find elsewhere other than perhaps on Android devices. No Braille notetaker will let you do your shopping and banking with apps designed by the bank and grocery company you and potentially millions of sighted customers select. This access to the same apps used by sighted people could be very helpful socially to blind students and other Braille users. It's an option they've never really had before the iPhone gained its VoiceOver screen reader. You could read news articles on an app or website in Braille while talking about them with friends. And then, there are the specialized apps that take advantage of the hardware built into your iOS device. Presuming you opt for a small portable Braille display, you could use an app like Voice Dream Scanner to take pictures of the pages of a restaurant menu and then read it in Braille while conversing with your dining companions. There are all kinds of situations like that where you want access to information but also want your ears free.
    Braille is especially useful when it comes to the study of Mathematics. It can be tremendously hard to picture how an equation is laid out while using synthetic speech. A Braille display supported with software such as the VoiceOver screen reader will let blind students and others feel the positions of parts of equations. This can make solving them a far easier process. There are other instances where having the ability to feel the position of information is critical, such as when examining charts or tables. How practical that is will depend on the length of your Braille display, or feeling a table one-handed while the other hand is reading the Braille display.
    Braille displays are very costly items and are built to last. I've had the same Focus 40 display since I got my first iPhone in 2010, and it worked wonderfully until 2019. The battery can no longer hold a charge. I have since acquired a much shorter and lighter Brailliant BI14. Not the best keyboard, but splendid for reading books while on the go. The core of my system is my iPhone and the VoiceOver screen reader. It takes full control of the Braille experience. As a result, I can have the latest features without upgrading the far more expensive Braille component until that becomes absolutely necessary. Furthermore, I can use my display with more than one device. If something happens to my iPhone, I could still use the display with a new iPHONE, whether that's a new one I acquire permanently or one which I might borrow from a relative or friend for a brief while. If your notetaker breaks down, you need to repair or replace a costly device and be without all of its functions while you're taking care of that. Meanwhile, if my display breaks, I still have my iOS device that can be used with speech.
    Perhaps, you already have a Braille notetaker. If so, fear not. Most of them can connect via Bluetooth and act as Braille displays for iOS. You have the best of both worlds. Some notetakers are designed to integrate with apps on iOS devices, making them an even more powerful combination.
Attention Please: When Notifications Pop Up
You're reading along when all of a sudden, the Weather Gods app decides to reveal that it's raining heavily outside. Perhaps, a friend has chosen to send a message asking how you're doing. Unless you have your device on the Do Not Disturb focus or have Notifications turned off, you will eventually be interrupted from whatever you might be doing by a notification from another app running in the background. In such a case, the same sort of thing happens with the focus of Braille as happens with speech. The interrupting notification automatically gets focus for a short time that you can determine before focus returns to what you were doing. You can determine this length of time in the Braille settings. Furthermore, if you pan through the notification while it has focus, you should be able to read it in an unhurried manner. Remember that if they do disappear on you, you can always find them in the Notifications Centre.
Braille Screen Input:
You need not have a Braille display for Braille to be a part of your iOS experience. The Braille Screen Input feature lets you use a virtual Braille keyboard by positioning your fingers on the touchscreen as if you were writing on a braille writer. You need to enable the option in the VoiceOver settings. Use the rotor item settings to make certain that the Braille Screen Input option is selected on your rotor. You can enter this input mode by using the rotor. Alternatively, you now have the option of enabling gestures which let you enter and exit Braille Screen Input mode without using the rotor. These options and others can be found in Settings, VoiceOver, Braille, Braille Screen Input settings. If the activation gestures setting is enabled, you can enter Braille Screen Input mode by putting a finger from one hand at the top of the screen and a finger from the other thand at the bottom. Tap twice with these fingers at the same time. To exit Braille Screen Input mode, slide two fingers in opposite directions on the screen. If you don'tuse this input mode, you may find that disabling these gestures is adviseable since they can trigger accidentally at times. 
    The dot positions can be calibrated to your natural finger positions on the screen surface. This kind of input can be very useful if people are skilled in writing Braille. If you have that skill and are new to touchscreen typing or haven't mastered typing on a standard keyboard, you may find it easier than dealing with the ordinary onscreen keyboard.
    In iOS 18, the Braille screen input mode was upgraded significantly and now has two parts. There's the input mode described above. There is also now a command mode. You can switch between input mode and command mode by swiping left or right with three fingers. This lets you gain the ability to enter any commands useable on Braille displays. There are a large number of such chord commands. You don't need to use the space bar to enter these commands while in command mode. To access and customize these chord commands, go into VoiceOver settings and into the commands area. Flick right past the Braille Screen Input option until you find Braille Keyboard commands. Double tap on this, and you'll find all the assigned commands. The Braille Screen Input option we passed by contains other important settings allowing you to configure this input mode. This includes deciding whether you want haptic and sound feedback for when you enter or exit the mode, enter characters, etc. You can also choose which Braille table of characters to use such as UEB uncontracted. Between these two sets of options, this gives you easy control of the rotor, text selection, cutting and pasting, and commands to get to areas like the status bar.
    You can also decide to reverse the positions of the outer dots. This way, dots three and six are closest to the imaginary spacebar, rather than the traditional method in which dot numbers increase the farther away from the spacebar you get. This can be helpful when you're making use of the screen away mode, where you hold the iPhone screen facing directly away from you in landscape mode. In tabletop mode when your iPhone lies flat on a solid surface in landscape mode, the default setting with dots 1 and 4 near the space bar seem more natural.
    While in input mode, in addition to typing in characters, you can also perform some other special gestures which make editing text you type in easier. To enter a space, swipe right with one finger. Swiping left with a finger will delete the last character entered. Swipe right with two fingers to move to a new line. Swipe up or down with one finger to cycle through spelling suggestions. Swiping up with three fingers enters a carriage return or sends a message. This is likely an incomplete list of special gestures used while in Braille screen input mode. People are encouraged to use the current user guide offered by Apple and to search for up-to-date articles on Apple support about Braille screen input mode, as well as other Braille related subjects. In the Braille Screen Input settings, you'll find a "learn more" link which will take you to a handy set of instructions. These should be enough to get people started using this additional capability. There is a well-written guide about using Braille Screen Input mode on Applevis at:
    https://www.applevis.com/guides/guide-braille-screen-input-ios-ipados
    You can find the most current information from Apple regarding common Braille commands by going to:
    https://support.apple.com/en-us/118665
    More attention is being paid to issues with all things Braille. The addition of command mode will be a massive help to those skilled in Braille. Provided they can master the touchscreen, they will basically turn their iPhones into a compelling alternative to a specialized Braille note-taker with speech output. I can't imagine a circumstance where you'd want to use Braille Screen Input while you have a Braille display connected with its own physical keyboard. However, there may well be a use case. There may be some ultraportable Braille displays without Braille keyboards. The commands made available in Command mode will likely prove easier to learn for people who have used Braille displays in the past.
Commonly Used Commands:
This guide won't go through every single command. The set of commands available to you depends on which Braille display you're using. The place you want to reach is a page called Braille Displays Supported by iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. Below that heading, you'll find a series of links to specific Braille display command lists. Additionally, below this, you'll find a link to a set of universal commands that should work on any display.

    The lists of Braille Commands are comprehensive, well-organized lists divided into headings and tables. Apple might change one or more of these commands at any time, so it's best to get them directly from Apple's own documentation. However, this subsection should go through the commands you'll need to start trying things out.
    Most Braille displays come equipped with some basic control buttons or other things like wheels or rocker switches. These minimize the need to take your hands off the display to control the computer it is connected to. Pretty much all displays include a Braille keyboard to facilitate input. Presuming you've gotten your display paired, you should feel Braille pop up as you move your finger over the screen. The controls on your display should do what the instructions that came with your display indicate. For instance, panning buttons will move left or right through text. Navigation rocker switches and advance bars should behave in logical ways. To start finding out what all the buttons do, you can use the keyboard help command, which is the spacebar plus the letter "k" (dots 1 and 3). Think of the spacebar like a control key. Once you've entered keyboard help mode, try other spacebar and character combinations. You will be told via speech what they are. This also applies to any other controls on your particular Braille display. VoiceOver has full support for at least 70 different Braille displays at the time this guide is being written in 2022. Even if your display only has a Braille keyboard, there will be enough spacebar key combinations for you to control your iOS device with reasonable proficiency.
Navigating Important iOS Areas:
There's a new handy way to get to apps you want to open while using a Braille display. Use the return combination while on the home screen. That involves holding down the space bar while also pressing dots one an five together. Type some of the name of the app you wish to open. A list of apps will appear which you can cycle through. The app which is selected will have a full cell before and after its name. Use the return combination again to launch the app once you have it selected.
    Any time you would like to reach the home screens, just use the spacebar and letter "h" (dots 1,2, and 5). This should work from anywhere in iOS. While on the home screen, you can start typing in the name of an app you would like to get to, and matching items will appear in a list that can be quickly scrolled through. You can scroll through this list or through all apps on the current home screen in order via the spacebar plus dot 1 for previous, or spacebar plus dot 4 for next item.
Braille Settings in VoiceOver:
Within the settings for VoiceOver in Accessibility settings, you'll find a subgroup simply called Braille. The VoiceOver screen reader is doing all the thinking, while your ultra-expensive Braille display simply moves dots up and down in perfect obedience. Your overall experience should be similar regardless of which display you use. This certainly holds true for the group of settings we'll discuss now. However, be aware that there is another group of settings called Braille Commands we will discuss later that allows for total customization of what buttons and key combinations you enter on your Braille display will do.
    These settings let you set things such as the particular code of Braille to be used with input and output. For instance, you might want six-dot uncontracted Braille for input and contracted Braille for output. You may not want to use UEB Braille if you aren't yet familiar with it. That's perfectly possible. Furthermore, you can choose whether you want word wrap on or off. Word wrap determines whether lines end with the last possible entire word, or whether they can contain the beginning of a word completed on the next line. You can also decide whether to have the panning buttons automatically proceed to the next page when you reach a page boundary and pan further.
    A welcome recent addition is the ability to have your Braille display automatically advance over text. You might use this when reading a book. There's a setting to let you set the time between advancements. You will need to create a command to start and stop auto-advance.
Connecting a Braille Display:
The first thing to do is pair your Braille display with your iOS device. Make certain the Braille display is ready to be paired via Bluetooth, and then flick right through the Braille settings until you come to choose a Braille Display. You should then find a list of any detected Braille displays. Be careful, since it may think ordinary keyboards are Braille displays. When you come to the name of your display, double tap on it to initiate pairing. You may be asked to enter a PIN number using the Braille display to help secure the pairing and make certain input coming from the display is recognized as that. There may be other Bluetooth devices connected to your device or operating close by. The number you enter sets up a secure and easily identifiable connection. Once a display has been paired, you shouldn't have to go through this process again in normal circumstances. If your display loses connection, simply locking the screen and unlocking it again should restore the connection.
    After you have successfully paired your display, the Braille on it should change as you move your finger around the screen. It will be showing the labels of apps or information on the screen as Braille when you touch it. Selected.
    In the Braille settings, you'll find a new setting to enable Bluetooth whenever VoiceOver starts up. This will especially help people who rely on Braille completely to at least be certain that Bluetooth is ready for their displays to connect when they're turned on. Meanwhile, in the "more info" setting for each Braille display, you'll find a setting which tells it to disconnect when the iPhone goes into locked mode. It will reconnect when the iPhone is awakened. This could save battery life on the display and iPhone. However, some Braille displays might not reconnect smoothly or at all automatically so use this with caution.
    Another new addition to Braille settings in VoiceOver is called the sound curtain. It's a way of making certain that while you're using Braille, your iPhone won't make any noise. This includes VoiceOver speech, music and any notification noises. The only sound you'll hear would be emergency alerts. You'll be warned about these consequences when you try to turn this feature on. The only way to get sound back would be to disconnect your Braille display. This setting will be useful if people are giving presentations using Braille displays connected to their iPhones. It will also allow deaf blind people to be certain that their iPhone isn't making sound which they're unable to hear.
Status Cells:
You can choose to have a cell on your display be used for showing status information rather than a character of normal output. Each dot in that cell indicates something such as that your battery is low, there is more text on the current line, a message awaits your attention, etc. You can decide whether the status cell is on the left or right side of the display. You also may select whether it shows general information like I described above or text information such as format, font, etc. for the current character. This would be useful when writing a document. If you're using a status cell, you can turn the rotor to a status cell setting and flick up or down to find out what each dot on the cell means.
Math and Equations:
There is a setting where you can choose whether Nemeth Code is used for equations. Increasingly, ebooks and other documents that contain mathematical equations are accessible through reading apps and VoiceOver. If you encounter mathematical equations while using a Braille display, one of the settings deals with whether you want the Nemeth Code designed to represent mathematics in Braille to be used.
Word Wrap:
Because iOS has full control of formatting what is sent to your Braille display, it can decide when lines end. The word wrap setting lets you decide whether words rap neatly onto lines, or whether a line can end with a partial word that's completed on the next line when you pan over. The first choice may help to clarify all words encountered at the end of lines. However, the other choice, which allows lines to contain all possible text that can be accommodated by your Braille display, may allow for faster reading.
Crossing Page Boundaries:
Another setting lets you choose whether panning over a page boundary automatically moves onto the next or previous page. I have it automatically advance, but can appreciate the utility of having panning stop at page boundaries. Keep in mind that some ebooks don't always give you printed page position. Kindle books provide a location number that you can use instantly to jump to a precise position if you know the number.
Input, Output, and Braille Codes:
There are different styles of Braille, much as there are different forms of writing. Depending on when and how people learn Braille, their needs and comfort with the various forms will be different. The input and output settings let you pick whether you want six-dot, eight-dot, contracted, or uncontracted Braille. iOS can support any of those choices quite well. You can also switch between these modes as needed. You might, for instance, wish to read in contracted six-dot Braille but write in uncontracted Braille.
    In addition to the type of Braille, there is a separate setting from the input and output settings that lets you decide the overall code of Braille to be used. You can choose between US, UK, and UEB Braille codes. The UEB Braille code is the recently introduced code of Braille that Braille libraries all over the English-speaking world are now using to produce books. Thanks to the Marrakesh Treaty, this will allow institutions and library patrons to take advantage of books already produced elsewhere, provided the countries have ratified the treaty. By eliminating the need to duplicate work already done elsewhere, institutions belonging to countries that have signed this treaty will free both time and money to broaden their selection of books. The ability to use this new code or, at the user's preference, the older US and UK Braille codes, lowers the bar for people who may not be familiar with the newer UEB code. They will still be able to read and enjoy the latest books in Braille, provided they can afford to purchase them.
Hiding the Onscreen Keyboard:
If you're not using the onscreen keyboard, you can hide it. This is useful if you're using a Bluetooth keyboard or a Braille display that typically has a built-in physical keyboard. A setting lets you choose whether the onscreen keyboard is shown or hidden. If you don't want the onscreen keyboard shown, that space will be repurposed and used to display more of whatever is on the screen, such as a document or page.
Taking Full Control Using a Braille Display:
Controlling two separate devices at once can be taxing on the brain and on productivity. In iOS 11, Apple eliminated the need for this for people using Braille displays. There is a somewhat hidden group of settings that lets you customize what all the key combinations and extra buttons on your Braille display will do. We will now explore this group of settings Apple has decided to call Braille Commands.
    To reach these options, you need to go into the VoiceOver settings and into the Braille subgroup of settings. Next, flick right through until you reach the Choose a Braille Display area. Flick right until you reach the More Info button to the right of the name of your display. Double tap on that. The very first button you come to in the More Info area will be Braille Commands. Double tap that, and you'll have found your way in.
    This seems like a strange place to stick such a powerful bunch of settings. However, it fits with how Apple has decided to handle other Bluetooth devices. Beside any connected device in Bluetooth settings, there's a similar More Info button. Any connected Braille displays are Bluetooth devices, so they're keeping to an established pattern. This means that you can have a different series of commands for any additional Braille displays you might need to connect with. For instance, you might have a different Braille display to use at work versus at home. In such a case, the correct set of Braille commands will be ready when you need them with no extra effort on your part.
    There are seven categories of commands, each with their own button. There are a good many commands, and most are rather self-explanatory. Rather than exhaustively going through each one, we'll take a quick tour of each of these areas. I'll give you an idea of what you'll find and why you might want to use what's there.
Braille:
The Braille area is where you can set commands that relate directly to Braille control. For instance, you can set a specific key command like spacebar plus dots 5 and 6 to let you change quickly between output modes. This would be useful if you quickly wanted to go into uncontracted mode to feel how something was spelled and then go back into contracted mode. You may want to set a command to turn word wrap on and off depending on what you're reading. For quick progression through a novel, contracted Braille with word wrap off might be the best way to go. However, when editing a document, you may want uncontracted Braille with word wrap on. Setting up commands in this area lets you do that from wherever you may happen to be. Such key combinations save you having to go all the way into Braille settings any time you want to do this.
Device:
Let's say you're sitting on a bus listening to some nifty tunes when someone sits down beside you and says something. You could be rude and ignore him or her. Alternatively, you should pause the music. A third, possibly preferable, option might be to use the keys on your Braille display to turn down the volume on the music, so you can hear both it and the person near you. That's the kind of thing the commands in this category are for. It's where you go to customize commands, letting you control your iOS device.
    You can set the command that simulates pressing the Home button. Another might take you to the Control Centre, the Notifications area, or summon Siri. There are commands that simulate rotating your device left and right. Others would let you easily adjust the volume using only your Braille display. All the while, your iPhone is safely tucked in your pocket.
Interaction:
Sometimes, especially while using Braille, you want to avoid taking your hands off the display but need to perform a gesture such as a double tap. This area has commands that let you simulate doing things like a single or double tap. They allow you to come up with commands on your display that eliminate the need to touch your iOS device to do simple things like a long press, use 3D Touch, etc. In normal circumstances, I find it easier to just touch my device and use the normal touchscreen gestures. However, if people struggle with using the touchscreen or have other hand mobility issues, these commands might make the difference between being able to use an iOS device or not. They offer a kind of precision that only a keyboard and numerous key commands can deliver. Given the relatively short time I've used a touchscreen extensively compared to the decades during which I dealt with my computer via such key combos, I'm gobsmacked at how positively old-school this now feels.
Keyboard:
This area lets you set commands to perform special things such as selecting text, copying, cutting, deleting, etc. Options to perform these tasks would normally be present on the virtual keyboard. This lets you access these options right on your Braille display using commands that you choose yourself. Many apps include extensive toolbars with these sorts of options.
Navigation:
This area lets you set up commands that help you move around. There are commands for moving to the next or previous line, paragraph, app, message, and much more. If you have an iPad, there's even a command letting you switch between apps running on the same screen. If you want to get somewhere without having to use the touchscreen, this is definitely the category to visit and make use of.
Rotor:
The rotor is so important that it has a separate area from the VoiceOver area right beside it. There are just five commands here: Next rotor option, previous rotor option, rotor up, Rotor down, and speak current rotor item. This will be especially welcome news for Braille users who have trouble with using the VoiceOver rotor gestures. People can use similar commands on a normal Bluetooth keyboard to control the rotor.
VoiceOver:
In this last category, you can set commands letting you make use of VoiceOver functions. This includes turning the screen curtain on or off, opening VoiceOver settings, speaking hints, muting speech, and many more. These commands can be key combinations or use extra buttons on your display if this is more advantageous to you.
Controlling Apps with Your Braille Display:
Now that we've theoretically covered how to set everything up, we'll discuss what it's like to control your iOS device using a Braille display. To get a proper sense of how things work, we'll examine the Google News app and make use of it completely through the Braille display. This isn't how I normally operate. Ordinarily, I would use speech output or else use the touchscreen to control apps and my Braille display for reading. However, approaching things completely through the Braille display demonstrates the possibilities for taking full control should that be necessary or preferable for you. This is the only time in the guide where this will be demonstrated. All other instructions for using apps will presume that speech output and the touchscreen are used. The techniques demonstrated here should be sufficient to help Braille users figure out how to make use of the majority of other accessible apps. The app I have chosen is available in the app store and has stood the test of time. It is a third-party app developed by people who have used Apple's accessibility tools to include blind people. Google News is very highly regarded by blind users.
    You will need to make use of the app store to acquire Google News. Searching the app store and obtaining apps are covered in detail elsewhere in this guide. One easy and quick approach is to invoke Siri and say "find Google News in the app store". You would then purchase the app by using the Get button and then completing the identification process that occurs whenever things are acquired in the iOS ecosystem. This is explained more fully elsewhere in the guide. Let's proceed with the assumption that the Google News app is acquired and present on your iOS device.
Using Google News with a Braille Display:
Google has produced a number of very useful apps for the iOS. It has made certain that these apps offer support for users of the VoiceOver screen reader built into iOS. At the time this guide was first being written in 2018, Canadians were still not able to make use of the News app produced by Apple. Alternatives are quite plentiful, but they don't come preinstalled with iOS. By the time the first edition was done, it was very possible to use the News app as a Canadian. You'll find a whole section about it called "News and Knowledge" later in this guide. Meanwhile, the Google News app should prove useful regardless of which country you happen to live in. It is also free to download and use. The more you use the Google News app, the more it learns about what you're interested in. This will affect the contents of your personal briefing, which is the section of the app that you start in upon opening it. To open Google News, find your way to the app and double tap on it. Alternatively, tell Siri to "launch Google News".
    Let's examine the concept of panning left and right. You start out on the "personal briefing" screen. Try using the panning buttons on your display. One thing that becomes immediately apparent, especially if you're using speech output as well as Braille, is that more is read back to you via speech than is obvious via Braille. The length of your display dictates how much is displayed at once. After the app has opened, it focusses on a title line that also happens to be a heading. This line indicates that you're in the personal briefing section and gives the user's name. That briefing contains the top five stories that Google believes will be of particular interest to you at the moment, and also has the current weather. That's too much information for most Braille displays. To read the rest of what you would hear and continue through the briefing, use the right panning button or key combination. You'll be using the left and right panning keys a great deal to look around. If you pan left as far as possible, you'll end up finding a Search button that wasn't spoken as the app opened up. It pays to explore. Spend some time on this initial screen getting the hang of panning around. Next, do the same with using the next and previous item button or key combinations. With the standard set of Braille key commands, these are spacebar plus dot 1 to go to a previous item or spacebar plus dot 4 to go to the next item. This is much faster than panning, since items may contain text requiring several presses of the panning button to go past. It also brings you to things such as "read more" links, buttons, and other things that might not be obviously functional given their text.
    It is also possible to get quickly to the bottom or top of Things. Let's suppose you want to get quickly to the top or bottom of a screen to then start exploring from that end of it. You'll eventually want to do this to get back to the top of a story you've read to reach the Back button to leave that story. You may want to reach the bottom of a screen to locate tabs, so you can quickly get to another tab in the app. To accomplish this, use the commands for reaching the top or bottom of screens. These are spacebar plus dots 1,2,3 to reach the top, or spacebar plus dots 4,5,6 to reach the bottom. Note the logical progression from the earlier previous and next item key combinations. There are helpful patterns such as this in the default set of commands that will aid you in mastering them.
    During your explorations, you'll have come across several elements such as "read more" links, buttons like the Search button near the top of the app, and tabs leading to different areas. The Google News app is chock-full of things like this, making it an excellent app to practice exploring with. To activate an item, use the key combination of the spacebar plus dots 3 and 6. This is the "activate" command and will cause any of the buttons, links, etc., to be interacted with provided you're directly upon them. Now, you can explore to any depth you wish when it comes to items discovered in the app. There will be plenty of news and articles of interest for you to read and explore.
    Remember that little search button we found while panning around? That packs some serious finding power. We are, after all, talking about an app made by Google, which is world-famous for its search capabilities. Make your way to that search button, and then use the spacebar plus dots 3 and 6 combination to activate it. A new dialogue will appear. You will automatically be placed within an edit field where you can type in whatever words you wish. Use the spacebar plus dots 3 and 6 activation command when you're finished typing to proceed to results matching your terms. You can then use the commands for panning and moving between next and previous items to look through these results. Use the activation key combination to select a result, and you will be taken to it. When finished, use the Back button to return to the list of search results. Pretty simple, isn't it?
Writing and Editing Using Braille:
While you're typing in search terms, feel what's there after you've written a word or two. Below a cell in what you've written, notice a pulsing couple of dots, presuming your display has eight-dot cells. These pulsing dots beneath a character are used to indicate precisely where your cursor is so that you can edit effectively. The commands to edit a piece of writing comprise the rotor commands to move around and the delete key for removing what you don't want. The delete key using the default Braille command set is spacebar plus the letter "d", which is dots 1, 4, and 5. In iOS, remember that the character deleted is to the left of the delete key, so move one character to the right of whatever letter you wish to remove.
    While editing larger documents or doing many other things, you would be using options on your rotor. A set of commands lets you turn the rotor without ever having touched your iOS device. While editing and writing text, you must use the rotor to move around by various amounts through text. The rotor also gives you options for selecting and operating on blocks of text. The Braille commands to turn the rotor are as follows:
    Turn rotor left to previous item - Spacebar plus dots 2 and 3
    Turn rotor right to next item - Spacebar plus dots 5 and 6
    Flick up - Spacebar plus dot 3
    Flick down - Spacebar plus dot 6
    By default, there is no command to speak or display the currently selected rotor item, but you could set one up for yourself in the Braille Commands settings.
Concluding Thoughts About Refreshable Braille:
Exploring the iOS operating system through the lens of its support for Braille has been an interesting journey. I came into this not knowing about most of what I discovered. Adding to my struggles was my lack of speed in both reading and writing Braille. I kept having a sense that things should have been quicker. Indeed, they are much quicker for people who are used to operating Braille displays with other screen readers or using Braille notetakers. People who are more proficient than I at reading and writing Braille will find a lot to like and take advantage of in terms of efficiency. I don't think they would find learning the commands and what various options do to be anywhere near as frustrating as I did.
    While doing research for this section of the guide, I felt that it was important to approach people who used Braille with their iOS devices regularly. I wanted to see if my intuitions on when and how they used Braille were correct, and see what I had doubtless not thought of at all. I found more than one helpful forum thread on the AppleVis site. Many people have found using Braille displays very advantageous when they need their ears free for participating in conversations while operating their iOS devices. Furthermore, while in noisy environments where VoiceOver was hard to hear, Braille was a very useful alternative.
    Typing in Braille on a display was also quite often sighted as a distinct advantage rather than using the onscreen keyboard. One lady mentioned that she used text adventure games to improve her Braille typing in a less stressful way than doing homework and fretting over every mistake. Provided one is proficient enough, Braille can at times be even quicker than speech when it comes to reading or getting things done. Furthermore, it leaves your ears free for listening to music while reading a good book.
    Proofreading is another excellent use for Braille displays. Now that word processing has become practical on iOS, people are able to read their own writing, which can give a different sense of it than having it read to you. Formatting information can be conveyed without breaking the flow of reading using the status cell.
    Braille is especially useful when it comes to the study of mathematics. It can be tremendously hard to picture how an equation is laid out while using synthetic speech. A Braille display supported with software such as the VoiceOver screen reader will let blind students and others feel the positions of parts of equations. This can make solving them a far easier process. There are other instances where having the ability to feel the position of information is critical, such as when examining charts or tables. How practical that is will depend on the length of your Braille display, or feeling a table one-handed while the other hand is reading the Braille display.
    There are well-designed Braille display cases that let you hang the display, so it's in front of your chest. You can then make use of it more easily while on the move or even while standing. My wife Sara has an old Braille notetaker that has such a case, letting her direct the choir of her church while referring to notes. Presuming you mastered the necessary commands, you could operate apps on an iPhone in your pocket without needing to hear it speak while having your display hanging at chest level, leaving your hands free for reading or other tasks. GPS apps might be operated using Braille in this manner while on the move. While recording the lecture series that accompanies this guide, I made use of a large 40-cell display on my lap along with some notes on my iPhone to keep me on track. Braille displays can be a powerful advantage when it comes to public speaking and presentations.
    Overall, Apple has developed a remarkable and powerful platform for Braille users. This is especially true now that the ability to customize what buttons and key combinations on your Braille display will do. With that power comes the danger of making a real mess of your interface. You might make so many changes that you forget what they all are, and then discover that you can't remember what the original default options were. The only solution I've found that gets you back to square one would be to make use of the Forget This Device button in the More INFO area for your Braille display. You could then re-pair it, and the settings would all return to the default ones, since your customizations for the display would have been forgotten. At that point, you could begin to set custom commands again. The good news is that once you have a command set that you like, it should stay there until you use the Forget This Device button.
    People may feel overwhelmed with the need to learn all the various commands and options. I certainly did. Don't forget that it's never an either/or choice. You are always free to use the touchscreen gestures you may be far more comfortable and familiar with. I think the real strength of combining refreshable Braille and iOS is when you use some commands but mostly use the touchscreen gestures. You don't have to memorize and use all the commands unless they work better for you.
    One thing that I have tried and can't recommend was using a Bluetooth keyboard as well as a Braille display. I had several instances where this seems to have caused some confusion. I found that the only way to fix this was to "forget" and then re-pair the Braille display with my iPhone. Thankfully, I hadn't customized a bunch of commands. Had I done so, this would have been quite frustrating. The majority of Braille displays have Braille keyboards included, and I suggest using those exclusively to avoid this setback.
    Braille literacy isn't something that should just be thrown away. However, people who advocate for it need to make certain they come at the problem from realistic angles. One thing that I fervently hope happens is that opportunities to have fun using Braille are as strongly encouraged as possible. I learned how to type and use access technology largely by playing games. IOS presents some unique opportunities in that apps that support VoiceOver are also perfectly accessible to sighted people. Look for games that are text-based and not dependant on visual hand-eye coordination. I'll make some recommendations in the section of this guide dedicated to games and their benefits. There was a series of game books that did a lot to encourage young teens to read more than they were inclined to. It was called Fighting Fantasy and combined reading with choices and dice rolling. So far, the apps that are bringing these games into the modern digital age do not include support for VoiceOver. This shuts blind people out of games that they could otherwise play easily. I would dearly love to see this situation change, and perhaps, have an organization fund the addition of accessibility to these games and other similar apps that are currently inaccessible. The excuse most frequently given for this state of affairs is that the app developers lack the funds to make this economically viable. If people really want to see Braille thrive, steps like making these sorts of games accessible could really help. I don't have many fun memories of Braille, apart from the occasional enjoyable book. That needs to change. I can easily envision multiplayer party adventure, board and card games played on equal terms with sighted and blind players. iOS certainly allows for this, but nobody has yet taken up the challenge extensively. This should and could easily change. Over time, more companies will make their apps accessible to VoiceOver, and hence, to Braille users. Rather than having this Braille access be an accidental by-product, I would very much like to see such efforts funded and requested by blindness organizations on the lookout for opportunities for this kind of thing. There are many circumstances in both work and play where having our ears free to focus on what others are saying can be absolutely crucial. Those sorts of circumstances are where Braille can really have a meaningful impact, even to people like myself who are used to speech output.
    I have high hopes for greater Braille literacy thanks to the journey I've taken with Apple and Braille. It has drastically widened the scope of possibilities when it comes to the circumstances in which Braille might be used in modern life. We're still in the early stages of exploration. There are two sources of momentum that must come into play. The piece of this puzzle that Apple does not control are affordable Braille displays. As I write this guide, serious efforts are underway to lower the financial barrier to refreshable Braille. Initiatives like the Orbit Reader and Braille Me hope to lower the cost dramatically to individuals of reliable refreshable Braille. The second piece of the puzzle is somewhat under Apple's influence. It can take measures to facilitate and strongly encourage app developers to support VoiceOver accessibility when creating apps and to keep Braille users in mind. As more apps are made intentionally accessible to users of speech output and Braille, awareness will spread more widely, and things will get better. Future generations won't be driven away from using Braille for lack of portability and convenience. The case for inclusion has at last reached a kind of critical mass. There is a long way to go, and in the case of Braille, the brakes have been on for quite a while now. However, technology has now taken off those brakes, started the car, and started us moving again. There is the potential to take Braille to some very innovative new places.

Voice Control:
One of the most anticipated features of iOS 13 falls squarely under the accessibility category. During the keynote presentation at the Worldwide Developer Conference in 2019, Voice Control was demonstrated. A man was seen to open apps, issue commands and edit text while dictating it all with his voice alone. The demonstration was a substantial part of the presentation and impressed the audience tremendously. There was a great deal of interest from all sorts of people wanting to control their iOS devices with their voices. There was instant and intense interest among blind users of iOS devices. Many blind people have some difficulties using touchscreen gestures, and this could help reduce what they needed to know before being able to broadly use their devices.
    Voice Control wasn't really conceived of with blind users in mind, let alone the average fully able sighted user. It was designed with the assumption that its users had mobility impairments that made it difficult for them to use touchscreens beyond a basic level. People with hand tremors or people who were paralyzed but who could speak clearly. The presumption was also that they could actually see the screen. Therefore, the only constant voice the system had to pay attention to was that of the user.
    Presuming a blind user is using synthetic speech to read the screen, this immediately throws up a point of trouble. Voice Control recognizes the speech output of VoiceOver just as easily as it does the speech from the user. This basically means that blind people will need to use EarPods, AirPods, or a headset of some sort so that only they will hear the speech output from VoiceOver. It can't tell the difference between voices. Improvements were made to make Voice Control work better with VoiceOver, but taking VoiceOver speech out of the picture through EarPods or other similar means is still essential. Voice Control was trained to recognize and act on VoiceOver commands such as "VoiceOver double tap". However, this was done late in the process. People who use Voice Control should start out with that understanding. Two iterations of iOS later, accommodations for blind users of Voice Control have greatly improved. VoiceOver gestures can be performed through Voice Control fairly intuitively.
    Think of Voice Control as a replacement for your keyboard or touchscreen. It is designed to use artificial intelligence to help understand your vocal commands, letting you control your device with your voice alone. Unlike Siri, it wasn't designed to actually find out answers to your questions or do tasks for you. The distinction may seem blurry for beginners who have used Siri, but it's important to keep the purposes of these separate voice-related tools clear to avoid frustration. When using Voice Control, you're doing what you could otherwise do via the touchscreen. Presuming you're competent with VoiceOver gestures, you'll frankly find using the touchscreen to be much more productive than trying to use Voice Control to do everything. Given current circumstances as of late 2021, managing one's expectations is pretty essential. Voice Control isn't as polished and well-developed as VoiceOver is now, after a decade's worth of development. I worry that people who don't understand this will go in expecting to be perfectly understood and obeyed. This frankly isn't what will happen when you start giving orders and dictating documents. People with sight can react more quickly if things go wrong and take advantage of visual aids and commands that you'd need sight to use effectively. For instance, they can see a grid of points on the screen which helps reference areas to be acted upon. As blind people, we need to hear the consequences of being misunderstood before we realize the need for corrective measures. Furthermore, we have to take time to hear what our options are, much like being on a phone using a company's spoken menus as you wait to hear which number to press to do this or that. Sighted people can simply perceive a grid of numbered options on their touchscreen and say the number corresponding to that option. I hope this helps you begin to perceive the points of lost productivity and friction. Nobody should get an iOS device thinking that they can just use their voice and be at all as efficient as blind users who have taken the time to master VoiceOver touchscreen gestures. Having hopefully made that clear, I will say that Voice Control can be a delightful convenience given the right circumstances. Also, it is an absolute liberation for people with disabilities which make it physically difficult to make use of a touchscreen.
    Apple provides instructions in its user guides about how to use Voice Control. Furthermore, they have added a tutorial which can be found in the Voice Control settings located in Accessibility settings under the Physical and Motor heading. That tutorial is accessible, but it doesn't provide any instructions on how best to use Voice Control at the same time as VoiceOver. For that, people who are interested should be certain to check on AppleVis for guides and podcasts and such. There is some discussion on Voice Control in the forums, as well as an excellent set of introductory podcasts on the topic. Remember that this capability was brand new to iOS 13 and more guidance is likely to appear as the feature improves and as more blind people gain increased experience with it.
What Voice Control Understands:
Let's be clear. Voice Control makes use of Apple's artificial intelligence engine. This happens mostly right on your device, but also takes advantage of Cloud-based artificial intelligence. This way, it can even work while you aren't connected to the Internet, letting you dictate text and perform other tasks that don't require you to be online. This capability takes up around 250 megabytes of storage for the ability to understand your voice while offline. Its ability to understand a user's voice is an outgrowth of what Siri can do. Like Siri, Voice Control doesn't actually understand the context of the words it hears. If you heard the words for "cup of coffee" in a language you didn't understand, you could, in time, learn to recognize that pattern of sound even when spoken by different people. However, unless someone translates those words telling you their meaning, you wouldn't know what the sounds referred to. This is where things stand with Voice Control. It doesn't really understand what a cup of coffee is or what you're saying. It is merely programmed to act on certain key commands and phrases.
    Voice Control has two modes of operation. Command mode is focused on understanding your orders, giving you as precise and intuitive control of your device as possible. You can say things like "next song", "open notes", "volume up", or "lock screen", controlling your device through command words and phrases. Extraneous talking, such as people conversing in the same space you occupy, shouldn't disrupt your ability to control your device very much, since only those command words and phrases will be acted upon. Meanwhile, dictation mode is concerned with optimizing the entry and editing of text. Words that aren't commands will be recognized and presumed to be text. This might be a document being worked on or text entered in a form field. Other special commands relative to editing text are made available while Dictation mode is being used. Be careful of any conversations taking place around you, as words may be added to edit fields that are in focus. At any time, you can say "go to sleep" if you want Voice Control not to act on anything it hears. Before using it again, you need to say the phrase "wake up".
Configuring Voice Control:
Apple built in a lot of voice commands, but recognized that users would want to shape Voice Control by adding new ones or having more words recognized. This can be achieved through the Settings app. You'll find everything you need in the Voice Control settings that are, naturally enough, found in the Accessibility branch. The system can be customized quite a lot. To get to Voice Control settings, either tell Siri to take you there or go to Settings, Accessibility, Voice Control. These settings constitute the only place where you can configure Voice Control. There's no other app or anything like that.
    There are two major settings for this. The first is a button called Customize Commands. This is where you can enable or disable commands, as well as add new ones. The other major section is Vocabulary, which is where you can teach Voice Control to recognize more words. You type these words in and artificial intelligence can then recognize them without depending on voice samples from anybody who might want to use the words. The same goes if you're adding new commands. You type in the name of the command and then record the gesture or set of gestures you want the command to do.
    It isn't easy to add new gesture commands as a blind user. This is one of the things Apple will have to work out better. If you're adding a gesture or gestures to be triggered when you say a phrase, there is a drawing area where you are supposed to perform gestures. Finding that drawing area is all too easy. The problem is that once you've made the gesture inside the drawing area, it's very tricky to find and double tap on the Save button located just beneath the status bar. With VoiceOver running, you often either accidentally tap within the gesture area, wrecking what you've drawn there, or else tap in the zone that activates the slide down gesture to reach the Control Centre and Notifications Centre. I almost always have that happen.
Dictating and Editing Text:
While in Dictation mode, you can speak text, and it'll be entered instantly. You are also supposed to be able to give editing commands such as "delete that", "correct phrase", etc. However, I've never gotten this to work for me. It always ends up not doing what I want and leaving the commands I dictated in the text, which I would then have to edit out. I tried to dictate some of this guide section and found it very frustrating. Many of my editing commands were simply entered into the document as if they were text. Also, that whole issue of context raises its ugly head. I had to look carefully through anything I dictated for misunderstandings that sounded close. For example, "come and" versus "command" versus "calm and". Think of all the homonyms such as "their" and "there", and "to", "too", and "two", etc. The misinterpretations made while dictating could often only be detected through the use of careful character by character proofreading. You wouldn't necessarily realize that a mistake was made if you just heard it read aloud naturally. A sighted user would see immediately that he or she had been misunderstood and be able to immediately employ the available editing commands to address the situation.
Voice Control Settings:
Besides the settings for adding your own vocabulary and customizing commands, you can determine what confirmation feedback you get when Voice Control receives a command. It can make a small chirp sound that is useful for blind users. Visual confirmation that it has received a command is also possible. Voice Control works in many languages, and you can set which language Voice Control understands. There's another setting for Voice Control hints, which suggests possible commands given the current context. VoiceOver will read out those hints. You can also set whether you want Voice Control to wake up when you look at your device, similar to how Face ID attention works. This could be very useful for people who look at their device to use it. You can also select from several overlay options.
    Overlays
    To help select commands, Voice Control has many possible choices for showing options. You can have a numbered grid displayed, so you just have to say the correct number to issue a command. You can also display names of options and apps. This is more useful for blind people, in my limited experience. The overlay flashes up on the screen on top of whatever else is there. You can have the overlay stay for many seconds or fade away after a while. VoiceOver continuously reads out the numbers or names if you have an overlay showing. It's almost like those voice menus on telephone banking or other phone systems.
Voice Control Reflections:
Currently, I haven't found Voice Control to be all that spectacularly useful. It can be nice to simply say "pause music", "next song", etc., having these commands acted upon instantly without needing to invoke Siri or leave the app I'm in. I certainly recognize the potential of Voice Control to become much more useful even to touchscreen veterans like me as it matures. However, do keep in mind that I'm coming at this as a well-experienced user of the touchscreen. People who really struggle with the touchscreen may find Voice Control a good deal more beneficial than I do. For me, Voice Control really isn't all that useful when I could simply make the right gestures or type quickly and accurately on a physical keyboard and accomplish more, faster. Apple was quite right to downplay initial expectations for blind users. You need to be using earbuds or a headset so VoiceOver doesn't interfere by speaking out loud. Also, since we have to wait to hear what happens as a result of our commands, it can become very cumbersome to use. Sighted people can see instantly when a word has been misunderstood, making immediate corrections. They can also scan over options quickly and zero in on the name or number they need to call out to have something done. As Apple develops this feature further, I think it certain that it will become much more useful for most users, including blind people.
    Voice Control will have a very substantial and rapidly appearing major indirect benefit to blind users that I keenly look forward to. The method of labelling app elements so that they can be operated with Voice Control is precisely the same method needed for labelling these elements for VoiceOver users to have much better access to a given app. Developers who take the time to make certain that their app elements and controls are labelled properly for accessibility can help a lot more potential users simply by doing this. Blind people using VoiceOver will benefit from these labels. So will any people who want to control apps with their voices. It improves the economic gain that is possible through taking the time to properly label apps. For this, alone, I'm truly thankful for Voice Control. I think it will become more useful for blind users over time as Apple works on the initial problems.
    My own experience is fairly limited with this newest of accessibility features. Sharing an apartment with my wife, who is also blind, we're both constantly doing sound-based things. Dictating a document, or doing other things via talking out loud isn't all that considerate when there are, frankly, better, more efficient ways to get things done. Having used the touchscreen, VoiceOver and other accessories such as a physical keyboard for ten years now, I would lose efficiency and speed were I to do more with Voice Control. I can type at a rate of around 90 words per minute with very few mistakes. When I've tried dictating a paragraph using Voice Control, there were more errors I then had to carefully hunt for. Many of these errors were only apparent if you examined word by word or character by character, discovering that the wrong homonym was used. The word "too" as in "also" rather than the word "two" as in the number. And then, there were occasions where my words were misinterpreted as entirely different words that could be mistaken for others without a good understanding of context. For instance, "calm and" rather than "command". Computers don't actually understand the words they encounter. That requires more contextual knowledge than they currently have.
    I've had more success with Voice Control when it comes to issuing commands. For instance, I can be working in a document and say "play music", "go home" to get to the home screens, "Open" a particular app, etc. It even recognizes a bunch of VoiceOver commands. Enough to let you "VoiceOver double tap" and "VoiceOver next rotor", and so on. I find it a painfully slow approach when compared to doing things with the touchscreen and VoiceOver gestures.
    Another thing to keep in mind is that only a small subset of VoiceOver commands has been built in so far. When I opened a book in the Kindle app and tried to read a book, the road became rocky and slow. I discovered that I couldn't turn to the next or previous page, since the three-finger swipe hadn't been built in. I worked out that this is what's known as "scrolling" left and right. So far, so good. Even better, saying "Scroll left" and "scroll right" worked in many other contexts, such as flipping through different home screens of apps. However, try as I might, I couldn't get the "scroll" command to work in a Kindle book.
    That left either reading the book completely in sequence or using "VoiceOver swipe left", "VoiceOver swipe right", and "VoiceOver double tap" to slowly and painfully navigate the Kindle book navigation menu. Not a fun approach at all, but possible if disability renders it impossible to use touchscreen gestures. Personally, at that point, I'd just go for an audiobook and call it a day.
    You can customize how Voice Control works. This is done in settings. To get there, go to settings, accessibility, voice control. This is the only place from where you can configure how Voice Control behaves. It is actually possible to add new commands. Perfect, I thought, gleefully. I could just add the VoiceOver gestures that were missing. Unfortunately, that isn't easy. Finding the area where you draw the gestures you want to use is easy. What proves next to impossible is finding and double tapping the Save button after making your gesture. This must be done without either touching inside the gesture drawing area, or touching low enough to activate the menu allowing access to the "Home" gesture. Again, it's technically possible with a great deal of precision, fiddling to create the needed commands. However, it just doesn't seem worth the trouble at present.

Live Speech and Personal Voice:
For people who had difficulty speaking or who were in danger of losing their voices, Apple introduced a couple of new capabilities. Using a new tool called "Live Speech", People could type what they wanted to say and have a voice read it out loud. Thanks to another capability called "Personal Voice", people could record themselves reading a hundred and fifty phrases and have their iPhones generate a voice from that material which sounded much like their own. This voice could speak from their iPhone's speakers, but could also be used in calls and online conferences. These capabilities are of tremendous benefit to people in danger of losing their voices or who have difficulty speaking clearly at times. This can integrate with other accessibility tools like switch control, so people with very little ability to move should be able to use this. The Live Speech feature puts a dialogue box on the screen which lets people type in what they want to say or pick from a number of preselected things to say. A voice can then speak this text out loud via the iPhone speaker, in a conference or call. This is a fairly traditional feature. However, Apple decided to take advantage of the machine learning on modern iPhones to do something special. Rather than a synthetic voice, people could create their own personal voice. The idea was that people would record themselves saying a number of sentences while in ideal private and quiet circumstances. These samples would then be put through a process using machine learning to create a version of their own voice which could be used in conjunction with the live speech feature. Having a voice which is constructed using your own voice samples will be of great comfort to people in situations like Stephen Hawking faced, as the degenerative disease he suffered robbed him of speech.
    There is no specific app for these features. They're a part of iOS and meant to be accessed whenever needed. Look in the accessibility settings. There, you'll find a new heading called "Speech". It's just past the "hearing" section. Under the "Speech" heading, there are two buttons. The first is "Live Speech". This lets you type in things to be spoken out loud or pick from a selection of phrases. The next button is called personal voice. This is where you can create your own voice.
    Once you've set up these features in the settings area, you can summon live speech when you require it in a few ways. Typically, you would do this with the accessibility shortcut by clicking the side button three times. However, this doesn't work as well for VoiceOver users. I strongly recommend that people who rely on VoiceOver make it the only feature you summon with the triple click shortcut. As an alternative, you could use the back tap feature found in the settings beneath the touch heading in accessibility settings. I recommend using the triple back-tap, as this will lead to less frequent accidental triggering. For people with the latest Pro iPhones, you could set the new action button to summon live speech when you need it.
    Whichever way you use, a dialogue screen will appear overtop of whatever app or home page you're on. You'll find a keyboard for typing in what you want the voice to say for you. There's also a button near the top left of the dialogue which lets you choose from prepared phrases. In the top-left corner of the dialogue, there's a button to close it and dismiss the feature. I find that an easy way to get to the dialogue box is to use the dock at the bottom of the touchscreen. Get onto the items in your dock and flick right past it. This doesn't work from within apps but will get you to the top of the dialogue box, which is the "phrases" button. Otherwise, you'll need to feel around the screen near the top to find the dialogue. Next is the close button followed by the keyboard. A send button is at the bottom right of the keyboard. This will cause your typed text or selected phrase to be spoken.
    To create your own personal voice, double tap on the "personal voice" button found to the right of "live speech" in accessibility settings. Find a quiet spot to record in. I recommend people wear earbuds or a headset so that the only thing picked up by the microphone is your own voice. You'll be presented with around a hundred and fifty phrases and sentences to read out loud. You can have the recording stop in between phrases so you can read them more than once with VoiceOver before recording them. It's possible to stop and resume the process later if necessary. The process is capable of dealing with some background noise. We have a fridge in our apartment which kept turning on for brief periods while I recorded my personal voice. I have yet to hear any noise apart from my voice when I've gotten it to speak. That being said, I wouldn't recommend trying to record a personal voice in a loud noisy place. On the other hand, don't panic if a small amount of background noise occurs. It's always possible to re-record a phrase even after you move onto others. Just use the "back" button to go back through the items.
    Once you're done recording all the phrases, leave your iPhone locked and charging for a while. This gives it time to do the machine learning work on the voice samples to create your unique, personal voice that's able to say whatever you type into the live speech dialogue. That requires a lot of processing power and will take hours of time when you're not using your iPhone.
    Don't worry if you need to use your iPhone. The process will pause and then resume when the iPhone is once again left for a while in locked and charging condition. You'll know that your personal voice is built and ready to be used via a notification when the personal voice is ready. Certainly, that should be the case the next morning if you leave your iPhone charging overnight while it's locked. The time needed likely depends on which iPhone you have. It took at least a couple of hours on my iPhone 15. Once the voice is ready, you can use it on any other devices you have such as iPads.
    There are some drawbacks to keep in mind when using these features. One downside is that if you use the live speech feature to say something on a phone call or Zoom conference, you can't hear anything said by others while your voice is saying something. Other than that, there's the efficiency of having to type or find and double tap on things you want to say. This is another situation where you wouldn't use these features out of laziness. However, if you lost your voice either temporarily or permanently due to illness, you'd be truly thankful for having them ready.

Siri and Apple Intelligence:
With VoiceOver, Voice Control and Siri all having to do with speech and the use of voice, there is a danger of confusion about which feature does what things. Failure to understand the very different purposes of these tools can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction, particularly for newcomers to all this. Before we discuss the most widely used and famous of these features, let's be clear with our terms.
    VoiceOver is a screen reader that provides feedback via Braille, sound, and synthetic speech output. It also offers a set of special gestures to make control of the touchscreen possible for blind users. Contents and control elements that would normally be seen are spoken out loud or turned into Braille for the benefit of blind users. This feature is covered in its own major section earlier in this guide.
    Voice Control is about input. It allows users to fully control their iOS device through their own voice. You'll find that another section covers this feature in detail. For now, just realize that it provides an interface for controlling your device, much like what you can do using a touchscreen. People speak certain commands and are able to select and activate elements or dictate text without needing to touch their screens. Voice Control doesn't verbally output anything on its own to let potential blind users know what has happened. That task falls to VoiceOver. Voice Control wasn't initially conceived of with blind users in mind. It was primarily designed for people with vision but who had other disabilities preventing them from using touchscreens. However, it is possible to use VoiceOver with Voice Control while using AirPods or headsets.
    Now, we come to Siri. Siri is what is popularly known as a "digital assistant". It is a system that employs human talent and expertise combined with powerful on-device and Cloud-connected, artificial intelligence. This artificial intelligence can tap into and search the staggering wealth of information on the Internet, as well as in other databases maintained by Apple and others. This Cloud-based system combines with the increasingly robust artificial intelligence housed locally in all iOS devices. All of these resources work in concert to seamlessly provide many different capabilities through a friendly conversational interface. Collectively, these capabilities are what is known as a digital assistant.
    Anyone who has a relatively modern iOS device can freely make use of Siri whenever and wherever they wish. Even while offline, Siri can still perform many tasks using the artificial intelligence onboard your device. As of iOS 15, it can now give you the time and date even when you're offline. I was absolutely staggered when I found this in the release notes of iOS 15.4 in March 2022. You'd think that with the clock and calendar able to provide this information, this would have been attended to far earlier in Siri's development.
    In iOS 18, things have gotten a little more complex with the introduction of Apple Intelligence. People using any iPhones less capable and older than an iPhone 15 Pro will experience Siri much as has always been the case. At this point, it is unknown how much Apple will improve Siri for iPhones incapable of supporting Apple Intelligence. Such support would have to be based on Apple's cloud computing artificial intelligence platform. People familiar with the previous edition of this book should take time to look in the relevant settings to discover new options. Depending on whether or not your iPhone supports Apple Intelligence, these will either be called Siri, or Apple Intelligence and Siri. Those who are familiar with what I've written about Siri should feel safe in skipping ahead to the section called Apple Intelligence. Any features which require Apple Intelligence will only work on iPhone 15 Pro devices or any more recently released iPhone. This is due mainly to the minimum of 8 gb of random access memory needed to run the large language models on your device which Apple Intelligence makes use of. Having this happen locally increases security and speed of response which are both important goals for Apple. For now, we will continue our discussion of Siri as things now stand.
    There are other digital assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. Both of these are available for your iOS device as apps that you can obtain free of charge from the app store. All of them work similarly to each other, but their capabilities and areas of strength differ.
    In its effort to sell products, Apple presents Siri as an extremely polished and superbly capable entity that smoothly does what people say, and answers questions concisely and brilliantly. You need not look hard on Google or YouTube to find out that the reality often falls hilariously short of this portrayal. The better you understand the intentions behind Siri, the less prone to frustration at its limitations, I think you'll be. There are two books I'll point you to that contain excellent and informative information on voice computing, digital assistants, and Siri itself. James Vlahos's book Talk to Me: How Voice Computing Will Transform The Way We Live, Work and Think, is a very approachable and extensive discussion of the artificial and human thinking behind Siri and the extent of current capabilities of voice computing in general. In particular, read the section titled "Assistants". Meanwhile, Brian Merchant's book, The One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone, gives us a detailed look at the materials and ideas contained in your iOS device. The entire book is well worth the read and absolutely fascinated me. However, if you're interested in Siri particularly, I direct you to Chapter 10 titled Hey Siri.
Setting up Siri:
Siri is now an integral component of the iOS operating system. Its artificial intelligence is constantly learning about you in the background, so it can make better suggestions and do other things to make life easier. Unless you skip the part of the setup process that deals with Siri, you will have prepared Siri as part of the setup process for your device. You would have been asked to train Siri to recognize your voice and asked to say a few phrases, including the famous invocation "Hey Siri". This would allow Siri to listen for you to say "hey Siri" whenever you wished to invoke the assistant. This process also helps Siri to recognize and understand your particular voice better. I recommend that all blind users do this. It does tend to reduce the chances of Siri waking up when other voices, such as the one which might well be reading this document to you, happen to include the words of summoning. It also increases Siri's ability to potentially understand you, even in noisy environments.
    Since the first edition of this guide was released, Siri has been updated in many ways. More requests are handled entirely on your device using onboard artificial intelligence. As of iOS 15, all speech recognition is done this way. One immediate gain of potential use to blind users is that there is no longer a one-minute limit on how long you can dictate to Siri. Processing speed is also greatly improved. The only times when the Internet is used is when Siri requires information found there to provide an answer.
    There are a growing number of settings for controlling how Siri behaves. To find these, go to the section of settings which is either called Siri, or Apple Intelligence and Siri depending on how current your iPhone happens to be. It's to the right of either the "Action Button" settings or "Accessibility" if your iPhone is less current. It should always be one flick to the left of the Camera settings. You can choose whether Siri can be used while your device is locked, and you're on the lock screen. You can also decide whether to have your device listen for the key phrase "hey Siri" or whether you just want to invoke Siri by holding down the Action or Home button until a beep is heard.
    Furthermore, you have other choices to make, such as what language Siri should use, which region and gender voice should be used, when to provide voice feedback, and information about yourself through your contact information created during setup.
    Likewise, you can also select the apps that can tie into Siri, allowing them to be suggested by Siri., and sometimes used through Siri to accomplish things. You can decide what Siri can do from the lock screen before you unlock your iPhone.
    Things are pretty self-explanatory here.
    There are many headings in this section of settings. The first is called "Siri and Apple Intelligence". In this section, you can find a link to learn more about Apple Intelligence. You can also find a master switch to turn it on or off. Turning off Apple Intelligence doesn't deactivate Siri. People who aren't interested in using Apple Intelligence might want to turn it off to save space on their iPhones. Currently, Apple Intelligence requires around 7 gb of storage space.
    The next heading is really the heart of Siri configuration. It is called "Siri Requests". Settings beneath this heading let you choose how you want to invoke Siri. You can have Siri listen constantly for your voice saying "Hey Siri". Alternatively, you might rather have things set so that you need to invoke Siri by holding down the Action or Home button on your device. This eliminates the chance of Siri activating because it thought you said ... those magic words. You may also decide to have Siri invoked in other ways. These include double tapping on an AirPod, pressing and holding on the button on the controls of EarPods, or using a button found on various Bluetooth headsets. One recent addition is a setting letting you type to Siri rather than talk once you've invoked the assistant. Personally, I recommend that this be set to off since the gesture of double tapping at the bottom edge of the screen seems to conflict with VoiceOver. As an alternative, I recommend having the "Type to Siri" control available in your control centre. People who want to make very frequent use of this capability could also use the "Action Button" setting and choose the "Type to Siri" control from the available choices there.
    In this section, you'll also find an option to decide whether Siri may be used while the device is locked. You may want to change this to off if you're in an environment where things are less secure. You will also find an option to select which language Siri uses. This may change which voices are available to decide from. There are often more than one dialect of a given language available. This includes American, Canadian, British, etc. The next option lets you pick the voice that Siri uses to speak to you with. The variety of voices has grown since the last version of this guide was published. For instance, there are now five American voices. The selection you have to pick from seems to be tied to which root language you decide. I can pick any of the American, British, Australian, and other English-speaking voices. One advantage of the American Siri voices is that they are considerably smaller, since they use artificial intelligence to generate speech on the fly.
    The next button is called "Siri responses". It presents options letting you select when Siri responds visually and when it speaks to you. I strongly recommend blind people select the "always" setting for spoken responses. This will make certain that you'll get verbal feedback even when your device is in silent mode. You can decide whether or not you want to have captions of Siri's answers as well as what it hears you say displayed on your screen. This can be useful when finding out how a word in an answer is spelled or figuring out why you might be misunderstood by Siri.
    In iOS 15, people gained the ability to have Siri announce notifications and calls. This can be particularly helpful for sighted users who don't routinely have such information announce to them via a screen reader. I have such options turned off. However, you can choose to have it work while using Car Play or while wearing headphones, in addition to never or always. The options for announcing incoming calls as well as notifications are similar to each other and present the options I've just outlined.
    The My Information setting is about making certain Siri knows who you are as the device owner. You can select the entry in your contacts with your own name to give Siri any information about you in that contact. This lets Siri do things like send messages on your behalf, address you by your name, etc. Once that's established, you can teach Siri about people who are important in your life and about their relationship with you. Later on, when you tell Siri to "call my wife" or "tell Uncle Bob I'll see you at lunch tomorrow", Siri will hopefully know who you mean.
    The "Siri dictation history" button lets you access the ability to delete any dictation information stored on Apple's servers. This gives you control of your privacy. You can't read through this stored information. Apple uses it to improve the function of Siri.
    Below these settings, you'll find a heading called "Extensions" if your iPhone supports Apple Intelligence. This lets you specify whether or not you want Apple Intelligence and Siri to make use of other third party artificial intelligence to retrieve answers or perform tasks for you. As of iOS 18, the only option here is the ChatGPT extension. This can tie directly into the ChatGPT service. If you don't have a ChatGPT account, Apple has arranged for you to be able to use its full capabilities a limited number of times. The basic ChatGPT functionality will always be available to you. If you have a ChatGPT account and are a subscriber to their service, you can make use of those advanced capabilities directly via Siri. Over time, other third-party extensions will appear as Apple makes arrangements with those companies.
    The next heading is called "Suggestions". Settings under this heading let you decide whether Apple can show suggestions from Siri and Apple Intelligence about things you may want to know about or do. These can appear in spotlight search, on the home or lock screens, in notifications, and elsewhere. They will improve as Siri and Apple Intelligence learn more about you as a user. I recommend leaving this on so that maximum information is available to blind people.
    Beneath these settings, there is a final heading called "Apple Intelligence and Siri App Access". These settings let you decide which apps and app clips can tie into Siri. Nothing you decide here is ever written in stone. If, at a later point, you wish to block Siri and Apple Intelligence from observing and possibly interacting with apps you use, simply go into these settings and make the changes you desire. Double tap on "apps" or "app clips", and you'll find a toggle on/off switch for each of the apps on your iPhone. These can each be toggled on or off to tell Siri whether or not you want it actively learning and offering suggestions while you're using that particular app. This gives you complete control over when Siri is analyzing what you do to serve you better.
    In terms of setting up Siri and Apple Intelligence, this relatively small group of settings is all Apple currently thinks is necessary. Everything else you'll be doing with Siri will happen through the commands and inquiries you make using your voice or via typing.
    There is also a Siri section in the accessibility settings. Some settings are duplicates from what you'll already find in the "Siri and Search" settings. However, there are a couple of potentially very useful, unique ones. "Type to Siri" can be turned on or off. When activated, you can hold on the site button to invoke Siri. A typing field will appear where you can enter your questions or commands to Siri via the onscreen keyboard or a physical Bluetooth keyboard. This could make Siri useful to someone who was deaf blind, provided he or she had a Braille display to read the output. This would also be useful in circumstances when you need to make use of Siri unobtrusively. Of course, Siri will still speak its answers unless you change the response settings. Another unique setting lets you specify whether apps being used can be seen in behind what Siri displays. This makes no difference to VoiceOver users, but may be of assistance for people with low vision who might be confused.
Commands and Inquiries:
When people talk to Siri to ask it a question, they usually get a spoken answer or find that Siri makes a call or does what they ask. Visually, a window appears on the screen that contains Siri's response. Often, this window contains more than is actually spoken aloud. Small wonder, then, that many uninformed sighted people presume that you can do absolutely everything these devices are capable of using only your voice. Such complete control simply isn't what Siri offers. Siri is designed to help accomplish a wide variety of basic tasks, in addition to performing searches for answers to inquiries. People are still expected to make use of the touchscreen to dig deeper into information or complete more complex tasks. It's similar to the handy little multitool I wear daily on my belt. I can't use it to build an entire house, but it'll do some lighter tasks in such an enterprise.
    The major role Siri is meant for is to find information online to provide answers to your spoken inquiries. These answers are spoken and also displayed on the touchscreen of your device. If, in answer to a question, Siri calls up a website having what it thinks is useful information, this website isn't always read out in full but is displayed on the touchscreen. To dig deeper, users can activate links displayed in such websites.
    Siri is designed to be more verbose in circumstances where the user is likely not able to look at the screen, such as while driving. In most circumstances, having absolutely everything read out would potentially annoy sighted users. It therefore typically won't do so beyond a fairly concise answer to an inquiry. Thanks to VoiceOver, blind people can also read websites offered up by Siri, taking full advantage of what is found. Using Siri, I can ask my iPhone to play a song, dictate an email or tweet, or perform other simple tasks. Frequently, only one or two exchanges with Siri are sufficient to send a message, create an appointment in the calendar, record a note, etc.
    There is a real danger of overestimating Siri's capabilities. Apple encourages people to try asking Siri anything at all. The worst that will happen is that Siri won't understand your question or be able to do something you tell it to. You must still actually do the heavy lifting using apps and other tools. It won't do your homework or write a master's thesis that you could then merely hand in.
    When answering questions, Siri typically provides quick and concise spoken answers compared to other digital assistants. Let's suppose I ask Siri to look up lizards on Wikipedia. If I'm lucky, as I was with this inquiry, Siri will read me a small portion of the Wikipedia entry on lizards and ask if I want to hear more. Other times, though, it simply says "I found something on the web about Antigonish, Nova Scotia. Check it out.". It then proceeds to display a web page that will hopefully have what I'm after. Note that it doesn't read the page it found for me, but merely puts it up on the screen. This can be helpful for sighted people, as there may be pictures or maps that they can take in at a glance, along with whatever text is present. For blind people, it's an absolute showstopper unless you have VoiceOver running. In conjunction with VoiceOver, Siri can be as incredibly useful to blind people as it is for those who can see. In fact, thanks to voice dictation, Siri can greatly lower the barrier faced by beginners who must learn enough about controlling the touchscreen to put their devices to more extensive use. For instance, a new blind owner of an iPhone may very well ask Siri to reply to a text message sent by a friend long before they master typing on the virtual keyboard.
    Invoking Siri is pretty simple, as was outlined above. However, getting a good feel for what it's actually capable of doing for you is a bit more tricky. This is done intentionally, as people are encouraged to try anything they can think of. Some of Siri's answers are written by clever writers who work hard to build a kind of personality for Siri, giving it friendly and often funny answers. Should you insult Siri, out of playful curiosity to see what happens, or perhaps out of actual frustration with its limitations, it will have an appropriate and often amusing response. In reality, Siri is neither contrite nor hurt by your rudeness. It doesn't actually understand words, numbers, or anything else. Lacking consciousness, it also lacks contextual awareness about the real world that we, as living beings, take for granted. Conversation with artificial intelligence is still a bit of a card trick. Human writers craft many of Siri's more fun or witty answers.
    Make no mistake, though. When you ask Siri a question or give it a command, you're tapping into something very powerful. Siri can and does search the Internet and other databases on your behalf for the information you request. A method called deep learning lets Siri learn from massive databases of information, as well as from times when it failed to understand questions or commands. It also understands numerous commands that let you control your device's more simple aspects. For instance, you can ask Siri to raise or lower the volume, turn on or off many features including various focus modes, and VoiceOver, tell you how much charge your device's battery has, or set alarms and timers.
    I wouldn't consider my wife or I to be particularly heavy users of Siri. We're both pretty efficient at using the touchscreen and the gestures VoiceOver provides. However, over the course of a day, both of us use Siri for some tasks and answers. When I start a load of laundry going in the washing machine or dryer, I'll ask Siri to "set timer for 35 minutes". After it expires, I can go down to the laundry room to move the load into the dryer or retrieve it. While putting the laundry away, I might ask Siri to "Shuffle party playlist" or "Play AMI Audio" so I can listen to an interesting show or music. Rather than going into my extensive folder of games, I might ask Siri to "Launch Dice World" or any other app I might want to use. While getting ready for a church meeting, I can use a Siri shortcut, connecting it to my Ulysses app. By simply saying: "church", I can quickly be taken to that group of sheets within Ulysses, so I can get at what I need more quickly via the touchscreen.
    Siri can really come in handy for short tasks like this, especially while you're doing other things or on the move. I can simply say "Hey Siri", "What's the weather like?" as I open the haul closet and reach for my coat. Amid an argument with a friend, I might ask "Hey Siri", "When did President Ronald Reagan die?" and receive my answer. Since it's spoken out loud, my friend can hear it and know instantly that my answer was correct. While washing dishes, I can carry on a text message, dictate a note, or do many other things at the same time without requiring my otherwise busy hands. There are all sorts of situations where Siri can come in handy like that, from doing quick calculations to finding out where you are.
    At its core, Siri is really about connections. When you ask a question, it might search several sources online to find the answer, which prior experience with similar inquiries made by you and others causes its programming to predict you're after. When you ask it to play a radio station, it connects to and searches multiple directories of online broadcast feeds to find the station you want. Through Siri shortcuts, which are discussed in the subsection below this one, app developers can further increase Siri's utility by creating connective interfaces with their apps. This would let users of a ride-sharing service like Uber or Lift simply ask Siri to order them a car. Using another Siri shortcut, they could order dinner at a restaurant that ride would take them to. As more data is gathered and more apps become connected with Siri, its capabilities and usefulness will continuously improve.
    Here are some thoughts on being a good boss for Siri. When speaking to Siri, I've found that it helps to speak clearly and strongly. Think of the voices of radio and television broadcasters you've heard. Don't imitate their voices. Speak in your own voice, since Siri will constantly train on recognizing it whenever you use the digital assistant. Think more about the clear, commanding style professional speakers you've heard tend to have, and try to adopt it. Also, be as precise about whatever you ask or order as you can. Think about any ambiguities your command might contain. For instance, I might say "play CHUM FM" to hear a favourite Toronto radio station. This will likely work, but I've had occasions where it has been misunderstood. Saying "Play one O four point five CHUM FM", or "play CHUM FM radio station" on the other hand, has worked every time I've tried it. Remember that Siri doesn't really understand context. It searches for matches and learns patterns. You're just about bound to be misunderstood at some point. If and when that happens, take a deep breath and try again.
Shortcuts:
A compelling addition to Siri's capabilities, Shortcuts let you say a short phrase or even a single word to Siri and have one or more events happen as a result. It has allowed app developers to equip their apps in ways never before possible, tying them directly into Siri. This means that an app like Uber can accept a ride request complete with address without requiring the prospective rider to actually enter the Uber app. A restaurant could have its app feature a Siri shortcut that initiates a brief conversation with a customer to book a table or order a meal. This is still a relatively new capability that developers are eagerly exploring the full potential of. Apple gains from this, as these shortcuts dramatically increase the utility of Siri.
    So far, I've been using shortcuts that have been created for apps. This doesn't even begin to approach the full potential of shortcuts. To delve deeper, you'll need to use the Shortcuts app. This app is now installed with iOS and is fully accessible to VoiceOver users. This is where you can create shortcuts. It is also where you can alter and remove shortcuts you may no longer require.
    We'll take a brief tour of this app below. However, I would advise anybody who plans on creating shortcuts to make use of Apple's own user guide to Shortcuts and the Shortcuts app. You can find this by going to https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios.
    The Shortcuts app grew out of a previously award-winning app called Workflow. It caused quite a stir on AppleVis because one of the awards it received was due to its being made fully accessible to blind people. The app creators made it possible for actions to be chained together easily using VoiceOver. This made it possible to automate all sorts of tasks. Apple eventually acquired the Workflow app and integrated it into what has become known as shortcuts today.
    There are three tabs across the bottom of this app. On the far left is My Shortcuts. This tab is where any shortcuts you create and any shortcuts you choose for personal use from the gallery are kept ready. In the centre is the Automation tab. This is where you'll deal with shortcuts that trigger when certain conditions happen. For instance, you might have a shortcut that turns on your smart appliances and lights when you arrive at your home. The tab on the far right is the Gallery tab. This is where you'll find a constantly growing library of shortcuts developed by app creators as well as other users. You can create shortcuts in the My Shortcuts tab and make them available in the gallery for others to use and adapt.
    My Shortcuts
    This tab is where all the shortcuts you create or have decided to use are stored. At the very top of this tab, you'll find an Edit button that lets you arrange the shortcuts as you desire. You can also remove shortcuts you no longer want. Next to this is a Create Shortcut button. This takes you to the shortcut creation area. After this point, you'll find a heading called My Shortcuts, followed by a list of all shortcuts you create or select from the gallery for personal use.
    As in other apps, you are able to make use of the actions rotor. Flicking down on a shortcut in the list will cycle between options. You can rename, duplicate, delete, edit, and activate the shortcut currently in focus. These actions are self-explanatory. You may want to duplicate a shortcut if you then want to edit one of the copies to turn it into a similar shortcut.
    Automation
    This is where you create shortcuts that respond automatically to conditions. You'll find two buttons awaiting you here. The first lets you deal with personal automations. These would be for running on your own device. The other button lets you set up home automations for use by everyone in your home. They will be active on the device you choose to use as a home hub. I have absolutely no experience with these kinds of shortcuts. Therefore, I will simply refer people wanting to use this tab to the link I provided above to the Apple user guide on shortcuts.
    Gallery
    This is the place to discover new shortcuts created by others. It is a very full and busy tab that thankfully makes use of buttons and headings to help navigate and keep things organized. The first element you come to at the top is a search field. Type keywords related to the kind of shortcut you hope to find, and you might strike gold. Next to that search field, you'll find a series of buttons leading to specific kinds of shortcuts. One of these is "shortcuts for accessibility". These buttons are useful for filtering the constantly growing collection of different shortcuts.
    Past those buttons, you come to the first of a series of sections separated by headings. The first heading is Suggested Automations. The next one down is Shortcuts From Your Apps. Don't forget to check for buttons near the headings or at the end of sections just before the next heading; they may lead to other categories.
    When you find a shortcut you're interested in, double tap on it. You can then flick to the right and go over all the parts that make up that shortcut, which includes the phrase used to activate the shortcut via Siri. You will be able to flick over the actions that the shortcut will perform when activated. Also, you can choose to add the shortcut to Siri, which puts it in My Shortcuts.
    Creating Shortcuts
    The Create Shortcut button found at the top of the My Shortcuts tab is what you want to double tap to get started. You can then name your shortcut and add actions to it.
    The user guide from Apple referenced earlier in this section will contain the most up-to-date instructions for creating shortcuts. You may also find one or more useful books at www.nbp.org. In particular, I would direct you to the books by Anna Dresner. One of her many helpful offerings is Getting The Job Done With Shortcuts: An Introduction For Blind Users.
Apple Intelligence:
Increasingly, Siri has fallen behind other digital assistants in terms of what it can do. Apple has approached the use of artificial intelligence very cautiously to keep people's information secure. In iOS 18, they have at last begun making their efforts to catch up in this area available to their customers. This effort falls under the umbrella of Apple Intelligence and is available on any iPhones from the 15 Pro forward. Apple goes to great efforts to explain in their marketing that they don't make use of your information. This brand of artificial intelligence is put at your service and will take every possible measure to guard your information privacy when you use it. Most of the artificial intelligence systems available for public use make you agree that your data can be used in some measure. If nothing else, it's used to train their artificial intelligence to perform better than the competition. One reason why it has taken Apple longer to offer similar capabilities is that it hasn't taken this approach and has respected individual privacy.
    Given how much trouble they have taken to explain and demonstrate their commitment to information privacy, they stand to lose a great deal of trust and income if it were ever shown that Apple wasn't keeping its word about this. As a result, I personally feel far safer using Apple Intelligence than I would in using other systems for research and creative work.
    There are three major areas which Apple is focussing its efforts to employ Apple Intelligence. These are contextual awareness of your life and information, help with writing, and image related tasks. Having access to what's happening on your screen as well as information present on your iPhone, it will be able to do a lot to help in everyday situations. An example given in Apple's keynote where they announced this feature had someone use Siri to figure out whether they had time to eat lunch with a friend at a restaurant before picking someone up at an airport. Augmented by Apple intelligence, Siri was able to check on the flight arrival time, the location of the restaurant, and other factors like traffic conditions. Using all of this information, it could give a competent answer to that question within seconds.
    This has tremendous implications for accessibility and ease of learning for beginners in the future. However, as of early 2025, we're not there yet. Apple knows that it needs to take the time to get things right, or this kind of thing will come off as creepy rather than helpful. Currently, I'm hearing that these aspects will emerge in iOS 19 during the last quarter of 2025 and over 2026. I'll be writing more about this aspect of Apple Intelligence in the fourth edition, which will be written for iOS 20. This should give more time for progress through what Apple hopes will ultimately be a rejuvenating evolution in the whole idea of what a smartphone is and how we use it.
    However, at present, this contextual awareness has yet to emerge and Siri continues to be thought of as a disappointment to those who compare it with other digital assistants.
    There are two more areas which Apple has decided to focus on. These are imagery and writing tools. In both cases, these capabilities are ultimately to be achieved using onboard large language models running on your iPhone. However, while Apple continues to work out the kinks, it has made arrangements with ChatGPT so that if the onboard system can't do the best job of something, you will be asked if you want to use ChatGPT instead. Apple regards these capabilities as still being in beta testing rather than fully ready, and offers ChatGPT when users might find this advantageous. The version used is running on Apple's own secure servers and the Open AI company responsible for ChatGPT doesn't get access to your information.
    There are two aspects to the imagery related intelligence. The image playground app lets you create images based off descriptions you give it. This app is accessible with VoiceOver. Once images have been created, you can then get brief descriptions using VoiceOver's image recognition capability. It may also be helpful to share such created images with other apps, such as Be My Eyes, to get a sighted person or another artificial intelligence to describe the images for you in detail. This is the only method I can think of how a totally blind person could put this app to actual use.
    The Playground app has a fairly simple layout and interface. You'll find any images near the top of the screen. If you flick right from the top-left corner, these will be what you flick onto first. Farther down the screen, you'll find things which help you create your images. There's an edit field near the bottom where you can enter a description of the image you want to create. There are also-buttons which let you choose people, places, and suggestions of things to be used in the images.
    You are able to type in things like: "Put my mother's picture in a field of flowers with the sun shining on her. Write the words Happy Birthday Mom! In gold letters above her head." It would then try to create that image for you. Recently, a choice of having these images done in a sketch style rather than the original style has been added. I have yet to encounter much reaction to this new option from people with sight. However, the original style was often described as cartoonish. People have trouble using it for practical things.
Visual Intelligence:
This feature does for the general population what apps like Seeing AI, Envision AI, Be My Eyes, and the recently released Ally assistant from Envision have done for blind people for years now. Essentially, it lets you take a picture with your iPhone's rear camera and then ask questions and gain information about that picture. Currently, this service makes use of ChatGPT and can also use Google to search for items similar to what's in the picture you take.
    I've tested this feature out in various situations. One drawback for blind users is that ChatGPT doesn't know that you're totally blind when it formulates its descriptions and answers. You should also be careful not to put your iPhone down or take too long before typing or dictating your questions. Pressing the "ask" button will cause an edit field to appear where this is then possible to do.
    This could be fun for new users who have yet to visit the app store where apps designed for blind users are generally more likely to be helpful.
    Visual intelligence really shines when you want more practical information about something rather than a description of it. I once used it to ask if a tropical drink a friend got for me should be chilled before being consumed and got a competent and helpful reply. However, you need to be somewhat experienced in holding the iPhone and directing the camera. New blind users would frankly be much better served by making use of the above-mentioned apps, which were specially designed for blind people. They tend to give more detailed and useful descriptive answers.
Writing Tools:
Apple has offered several tools to help people improve their writing via Apple Intelligence. People can select some text or submit the entire document they're working on to various manipulations. Currently, tools include options to proofread or totally rewrite the selection differently. You can change the style to be more friendly, professional, or concise. Other tools let you summarize apiece of writing, pick out the key points, make a bullet list or table. If all that fails to do what you want, there is also an edit box where you can describe the changes you desire in your own words. For instance, you could ask it to rewrite an email in a Shakespearean style. Apple Intelligence will then attempt to carry out your request. It may not understand what you want. I've had occasions where it said it was finished, but when I checked, there was simply the word "loading" where the altered text should be. You might have to hit the "back" button and find another way of describing what you want done.
    All of this power is available system-wide. Wherever you are able to enter text, you can make use of these tools. Once in an edit field, turn the rotor to "edit" and flick up or down through the options. You will quickly come to "writing tools". Double-tap on this and a dialogue will appear with the available tools. Flick left or right through the options and double-tap on what you want to use. When you do this, a further dialogue will open up with your original writing at the bottom and the altered writing at the top. Once you've read through what Apple Intelligence has generated, you can then choose to copy the new writing into the original edit field. The new writing will appear above the older. You can also decide to replace your original writing with what the tool you selected has generated. The "back" button at the top left of the dialogue lets you return to the writing tools without making any changes. Alternatively, the "done" button lets you exit the writing tools altogether, returning you to the original edit field with your unaltered text intact.
    When I've used these tools in the previous paragraphs about them above, Apple Intelligence has taken around five seconds or less to complete the process. Larger amounts of text, such as a whole section of this book, took longer to process. Keep in mind that many decisions are being made. The more you feed into these tools at once, the more careful you should be about reading over the results. Remember that the system doesn't fundamentally understand reality or the words being used. It follows rules about sentence structure, punctuation and such. You are very unlikely to agree with all the decisions made in this area. It's simply looking through a massive database of writing and conclusions drawn from previous attempts to satisfy conditions. It might very well figure out where to place the words "cup of coffee". However, it wouldn't understand that the coffee might be hot or that the cup might be breakable.
Summarization:
Another area where people have really begun to welcome Apple Intelligence is in its ability to summarize material. People will find these summaries in the Mail app, in their notifications, messages, and other places throughout iOS. These summaries do a reasonable job of taking longer message threads or blocks of text and bringing forth the important points.
    As before, people need to remember that the system doesn't fundamentally understand what it's abbreviating. Apple has had to prevent the summarization of notifications about news articles because of mistakes which totally changed the meaning of the original material, leading people to false conclusions. When I used the summarization writing tool, I found that it didn't do as well with sets of instructions. Be careful when using these summaries.
Integration With Productivity Apps:
Apple has now taken special care to integrate Apple Intelligence related capabilities into its suite of productivity apps. This means that you can use writing tools in the Numbers, Keynote and Pages apps to edit text in spreadsheets, documents, or presentations. You can also do things like create images for use in things you produce with these apps. Another app which is getting special attention is Freeform. People who make use of Freeform for mental mapping or collaborative brainstorming can put these tools and assets created in the other apps into their Freeform canvasses. Presumably, as Siri becomes contextually aware of what you're doing, it will be able to offer suggestions and help you accomplish your work.
Reflections on Apple Intelligence and Siri:
The release of iOS 18 marks the somewhat disappointing start of the largest fundamental transformation ever attempted in terms of what it means to own an iPhone. Apple has a history of not being the first to reach a certain point, but eventually making a big splash when they enter a race from the rear and pull ahead of the competition. This time around, we have what I describe as a rather painful belly flop on our hands. Being behind in such a crucial area clearly put too much marketing pressure on Apple, which was compelled to reveal more than they were ready to.
    Clearly, Apple intends to merge Siri with Apple Intelligence to provide something very much needed. Artificial intelligence which is really focussed on individual needs and isn't sucking up their data for other purposes. Having a large language model running on your iPhone which is aware of your personal context has all sorts of implications for ease of use, privacy, and accessibility. Progress really hinges as much on Apple maintaining the trust and security of its users as on any innovations they come up with from this point forward. Had Apple waited until all three components were reasonably well polished and working smoothly, a great deal of disappointment could have been avoided.
    So far, I can't honestly say that what I've experienced of Apple Intelligence has blown me away. As things stand in mid-2025, people could have achieved often better results by simply using the artificial intelligence apps provided by the creators of ChatGPT and Google. Apple has scrambled to lessen its vulnerability to false advertising charges.
    Be that as it may, this could change drastically as Apple hits their stride over the following years. Full control of hardware and software should eventually allow Apple to offer a digital assistant which is speedy, secure, and contextually aware as promised. Having this assistant built with your privacy in mind right from the start is more important than many people realize. I've read comments from other AI companies which indicate to me that this is a scary proposition for them. It would give people the benefits of their offerings without mining and selling their data. It would truly be shaking to the industry as it now stands. This basic idea is good and would indeed offer something unique.
    At this point, they can't really back out of this initiative due to the current lamentable condition of Siri. Apple really has to make good on this overall vision as soon as possible. By lifting the curtain too early, they have increased the pressure on their development staff and disappointed their customers. Early adopter's like me are left wondering if we'll be able to experience the complete system as envisioned by Apple before needing to upgrade to new iPhones which are better equipped to handle the increased demands.
    Being an incurable optimist, I predict that Apple will make good on this promise. Internally, they have taken some drastic steps to bolster the team working on Apple Intelligence and especially Siri. Sadly, one of the consequences of the delays in this area might be that these initial iPhones built for Apple Intelligence will be rendered less desirable more quickly than might be wished. One key factor is the amount of RAM in iPhones. A minimum of 8 gb is needed to run the current large language model Apple uses. The Consistent rumours suggest that Apple will be drastically increasing the RAM in the next generation of iPhones. As contextual awareness becomes present, such constant vigilance might cause increased battery drain. There are many factors and unknowns going forward.
    Siri has continued to gain new capabilities. However, it hasn't really gotten more reliably able to understand and execute tasks. It has also not managed to keep up with other digital assistants when it comes to answering questions. Thankfully, it can now send tasks and questions to ChatGPT for processing by that artificial intelligence. Apple will soon offer a similar integration with Google Gemini and other assistants. I've found this to be a helpful, if somewhat clunky interim solution. It allows me to get more complex answers than SIri is currently capable of providing. However, it doesn't really give me a clear sense of what the actual Apple Intelligence will be capable of in the most desired area of improvement promised. That of a drastically improved Siri.
    My current need for such assistants is met by Google and the access to ChatGPT through Siri which Apple makes available free of charge. I'm not particularly worried about revealing anything sensitive through my inquiries. Having much more faith in Apple when it comes to protecting my information, I'll be eager to make increased use of its own artificial intelligence as it develops more fully.
    For other players in this space, these services are much more about collecting data and making money. Having a digital assistant especially built not to do that and to keep our personal data private would be very desirable in this time of so much misuse of information.
    Of course, being as invested in the Apple ecosystem as we are has a way of making Siri more attractive. My wife Sara and I each have Apple Watches which can tap into Siri, I have also acquired a pair of Home-pod Mini smart speakers. These have become part of our everyday life. We mostly use them to listen to radio, audio dramas and other programming which Sara and I both want to hear. I also often ask Siri questions while working at my desk and find it very convenient to have the HomePods set to listen for Siri while my iPhone is set not to. This lets me access answers to at least basic inquiries without ever leaving the app I'm in. We're both far more comfortable with Apple devices, listening for those magic words of summoning as we go about our lives. They have the least to gain and the most to lose by misusing our information.
    Siri is getting better at giving you control of music, settings on your device, taking message dictation, etc. Apple is constantly working on expanding its capabilities. Large changes are usually introduced with iOS updates, but things are doubtless still improving slowly on at their end in the cloud. Given the new focus on handling as much as possible on one's own device rather than in the cloud, I presume we'll see that side of things improves mainly with these iOS updates. Hopefully, now that this major transition to Apple Intelligence is underway, we won't see features which are so critical to seniors and other people less skilled with tech and touchscreen disabled like we did over the past while. Siri will increasingly learn about your interests, manner of speaking, and other personal things, keeping everything on your device. Efforts are constantly underway to make Siri better understand different accents and people who have difficulty speaking.
    Upgrading to a large language model really will be a jump forward for Siri. It should make a big difference and improve Siri's capabilities tremendously when Apple develops Apple Intelligence far enough to grow past its birthing pains. I have every confidence that by the time I publish the fourth edition of this guide in a couple of years, we'll have a lot more to cover in this area.

Stay Informed With Notifications:
As you begin using your iOS device in earnest, you'll frequently encounter notifications. They are a primary means of relaying information to you from apps running on your device. Typically, you'll get notifications from apps which are running in the background out of sight while you're focussing on something else. They might also appear while you're travelling with your iPhone in your pocket. They may at times interrupt your work. It all depends on how well you master the various settings and tools Apple provides to bring order to the chaos and manage how and when they appear.
    I think this is one of the most crucial areas for blind people to really comprehend what options they have to get the most out of their iOS device. For blind users, a notification will typically be spoken out loud by VoiceOver. Only after it has finished or been silenced will VoiceOver return its attention to whatever you were previously hearing. If they're using a Braille display, the notification will pull them out of whatever they may have been reading prior to its arrival. Only after a certain time has passed will the notification disappear and return the reader to the app or other area they were previously in. A crucial difference for blind people is that they will hear or read the notification in the identical voice to what they were potentially already using to work with their devices. There's no real barrier or equivalent of a change in font or designated area of appearance. VoiceOver will simply say the word "notification" and then proceed to read the information it contains. Braille will likewise jump to the notification. This can be quite discombobulating to one's mental flow. Meanwhile, sighted people can look through the notification to whatever they were viewing before its arrival. They can still see what they were working on and aren't pulled completely out of it. Furthermore, the banners are contained and easily distinguished from whatever they may have previously been focussed on. Therefore, the effect isn't as jarring for them.
    Many blind people who I've spoken to were frustrated that their iPhone was distracting them with information they didn't want while they tried to do something. Perhaps, they were trying to read a book and suddenly found themselves reading a notification about a message from a friend. There are many times when we don't want to wait to hear information before continuing to, for instance, finish typing this sentence. While navigating in the real world, you don't always want to be pulled out of your GPS app by a notification from social media. However, learning about changing weather conditions might be useful during that same time. Any effort you put into becoming familiar with notifications settings as a blind user is time very well spent. It will make the difference between you feeling effective and in control, or feeling constantly distracted and interrupted when you don't want to be.
    Provided you take the time to explore and learn about notifications and focus settings, all of this can be customized. Things may seem a little overwhelming and out of your control at first. However, you can have your cake and eat it too. You can be free of undesired distractions when you need to be. It is also possible to let desired information through so that you need not worry about missing out while working at something else.
    In this section, we'll take a deep dive into these communications from the apps and services which comprise your digital life. We'll learn how they can appear and what control we have over them.
    To begin with, let's go over what a typical notification is composed of. The very first thing a notification contains is which app or service generated it. For example, the Weather app tells me via notifications when it will rain in my current location. The word "Weather" at the beginning of this notification might seem superfluous. However, it is the name of the actual app. There are other weather related apps such as Weather Gods which also deliver notifications about the weather. Perhaps, the forecasts from two similar apps such as these might differ. Because you are clearly informed which app supplied the notifications, you are able to determine the app which proves more trustworthy over time.
    The next piece of information in a notification is roughly how long ago the notification was delivered. This is often quite useful information when it comes to prioritizing what you want to respond to or deal with. The older a notification gets, the less precise the indication of how long ago the notification was delivered will be. A more recent notification will indicate that it was delivered twenty-five minutes ago. However, a note which is hours old will specify the number of hours, but not minutes. This holds true for days and weeks etc.
    Following the creation app and time stamp, you'll come to the actual information contained in the notification. A game might wish to inform you that your warriors are ready for adventure. A social media app such as Twitter might want to tell you about a new follower or a tweet which mentioned you. A news related app may inform you of breaking news in an area which you've indicated a particular interest in being informed about. Services like the phone or messages apps will generate notifications to tell you about calls you missed or messages which have arrived. The possibilities are limitless.
    While a notification's main purpose is to deliver information, they can do more than this. They can serve as a way to get quickly into an app right to the area related to the notification. For instance, you might receive a notification from YouTube about a new video from a channel you follow. If you perform a one finger double tap on the notification, you will be taken into YouTube directly to the video in question. Similarly, doing a one finger double tap on a notification about a tweet will typically take you into the Twitter app and into the tweet or conversation thread. Notifications may make other interactive options available, such as replying to a message.
    You have a great deal of latitude regarding how intrusive notifications from apps and services are. This kind of control is vital to making your device a practical tool rather than a chattering distraction. When I'm recording lectures, I prefer not to be interrupted unless it's actually important. Perhaps, I'm waiting for delivery of a package and don't want to miss knowing about its arrival while I blather away. It's less of a hassle to stop working and get the package than to have to go and pick it up somewhere else. I therefore wouldn't want to completely shut off notifications from some apps even when I'm busy. Instead, I would create a focus mode which stopped most apps from alerting me so that their notifications appear quietly in the Notification Centre. This sort of thing is also helpful when you're using a GPS device to navigate and don't want to be pulled out of that app unless it's important. Meanwhile, I would use the notifications settings to streamline which apps were normally allowed to deliver notifications and how I wanted it done.
The Notification Centre:
Unless you specify otherwise, all notifications from your apps will appear in the notification centre. It is a particularly useful area for blind people, as it serves as a catch-all for information that might have been missed while you were busy doing something else. Often, notification announcements interrupt us when we least need them to. Perhaps, we're writing a document under time pressure or in the middle of a conversation. We may accidentally or intentionally silence them before they finish reading to get back to what we were doing. Because notifications can always be found in the notification centre, we have that safety net and can check there at our convenience to find what we missed.
    It is actually sometimes desirable to specifically set an app's notifications not to appear in the notification centre. This is especially true if the notifications are so time-sensitive as to be useless after being generated. One example of this is a number of apps which use the notifications system in iOS as a means of giving time alerts, such as quarterly chimes. The Westminster Chimes Full app is a good example of this. It uses the notifications system to be able to deliver audible chimes or time announcements at hourly or other intervals. This eliminates the need to look at a clock while busy doing other things. Having such notifications pile up in the notification centre would be quite undesirable. They contain no information which is of any use past the point when they trigger and let loose their chime or announcement of the time. There are many examples of features in iOS being used for purposes like this beyond what they were designed for.
    To reach the notification centre, touch the status bar and, with three fingers at once, swipe downward. Alternatively, touch near the top of the screen until you hear a short low tic. Drag your finger downward until you hear two more tics which rise in pitch. Lift your finger after hearing the third one, and you'll appear in the notification centre. Once there, touch your finger near the top left of the screen and flick right with a finger to explore the current contents. They will be in order from most current to older notifications, you can flick right through what is available. Double tapping on a notification will open the group of notifications related to the app which generated it. If you're inside a group or the notification doesn't belong to a group, double tapping on it will open the app that generated it and put you there.
    Flicking up or down on a given notification may yield more options, allowing for even more efficient action. This depends on how well an app has been integrated with the Notification Centre. Available options depend on the app in question. An example of what's possible is following someone who has followed you on X without needing to go into the app itself. Any interactions available directly from a notification will be basic in nature. To do anything major, you'll still have to go into an app.
    Notifications may be grouped and organized to suit your preferences. This can drastically reduce clutter in the notification centre. For instance, all notifications generated by social media apps like X can be grouped, so they don't clutter up everything else. You can then expand that group when you actually want to look at all of those particular notifications. Alternatively, you can delete all of them at once as a group. Flicking down on a group of notifications brings you to options, including one that lets you manage the group. Double tapping on this lets you determine how notifications from a given app are to be treated. My favourite use for this is to have notifications from certain apps delivered quietly, so they don't disturb my work, but are still made available in the Notification Centre when I feel like checking it. Basically, a notification is delivered quietly if it simply appears in the notification centre without triggering any sound, badge, or banner. It can make a big difference in feeling that your device is at your command rather than you at its.
    Notifications can also be organized in different orders and managed in the Settings app in the Notifications section found just to the left of Sounds & Haptics. In there, each app that can generate notifications has a style choice button beside its name. You can choose among several options depending on how intrusive you want the notifications to actually be. They can generate sounds or appear as banners that speak and then disappear. Alternatively, they can appear as persistent banners, forcing you to deal with them or dismiss them before doing anything else. As another alternative, they can simply be added to your Notification Centre and not interrupt you at all.
    You are given quite a lot of latitude here, which it is now time to explore more deeply.
Notifications Settings:
When you use the settings in this notifications section, think on a macro level. They deal with how you generally want notifications from a given app to behave in normal everyday circumstances. Perhaps, you want notifications from a messaging app to always be announced. You may, on the other hand, want notifications from news apps to appear in the notifications centre without interrupting what you're doing most of the time. You can then use the focus settings to override this normal behaviour when it's necessary to minimize distractions. This will result in you needing to spend less time changing the notification settings from what you would ordinarily prefer.
    Each app capable of generating notifications has a corresponding setting within the Notifications settings. At the start of these settings are a couple of what I think of as "master" settings. The first is new to iOS 15. It lets you schedule when you want to have summaries of possibly missed notifications created by the artificial intelligence in your device. These summaries will await your pleasure in the notifications centre. The next setting allows instant and overriding control over when notification previews are shown. Notification Previews contain some or all of the contents of a notification. For example, a notification from Twitter might include the contents of a tweet. This is all well and good provided the information isn't in some way sensitive. It can help you quickly determine whether something needs to be dealt with urgently or may safely be left until later. However, if you're likely to get an email about your outstanding debt, or a tweet about what a wimp you were in last week's boxing match, you may want that sort of information to remain safe from innocent eyes and ears. You can therefore elect to reveal Notification Previews always, only when your device is unlocked and presumably in your control, or never. When previews aren't shown, you are still notified that a given app has a notification for you. You simply won't know anything else about it until you investigate further.
    As fluke would have it, just as I wrote the preceding sentence, a Kindle book I preordered became available. Because I chose to allow Notification Previews, I learned the book's title. In this case, the book was one I had since learned was a book for children, covering the same ground as a book for adults the author wrote previously. I was therefore able to return the Kindle book right away before the window during which you can return such purchases expires. Had I not allowed for Notification Previews, I would merely have been told that the Kindle app had a notification for me. I may in consequence have failed to learn what I learned in time to get my easy refund.
    The next button lets you decide whether to allow notifications to show while you're sharing your screen or having it mirrored on a larger device, perhaps to give a presentation. Turning the option to off will prevent any such occurrences from happening.
    The next area is beneath a heading called "Siri". The options here will determine what Siri, the intelligent assistant on your device, does with notifications and suggestions. You can choose whether you want Siri to read time sensitive notifications out loud independently of VoiceOver. Siri will listen after reading a notification for any interactive response you may wish to verbally instruct it to do. The next button in the "Siri" heading gets you into an area where you can allow or disallow apps from making shortcut suggestions through Siri while on the lock screen. Each app you have can be allowed or disallowed individually.
    Past this point, we get into a section complete with a heading that is called Notification Style. This lets you determine if, how, and when apps are able to notify you about information or the results of activities that happen while the apps are running in the background and not in focus. Each app that can generate notifications has an entry. As you obtain more apps, this section will grow larger. The apps will always be listed in alphabetical order. Flick left or right over the entries in the list. You'll hear the app's name followed by the current setting for that app. For instance, "sounds and badges". To change these settings, double tap on the app's name and then flick right to go over the options. Double tap on an option you want to change and then flick right over any options presented. Double tap on the choice you wish to make. It's all pretty simple and intuitive. We will now go over the available Notification Style choices in detail.
    Let's choose the Aira app as an example. This app lets you call trained sighted agents for assistance when you need it. The app itself is free and very handy to have on one's iPhone. Double tapping on its name in the Notification Style section, the very first option we come to is whether to have the ability to produce notifications be on or off. Double tap this control to toggle between on or off as desired. Some apps can generate many notifications, so there may well be times when you simply want a total break from them. Turning this setting to off will achieve this.
    Flicking to the right of this switch, we come to another heading called "Notification delivery". Past this heading, we find options to have notifications delivered immediately or be added in the next scheduled summary. Either way, the notification may also be found in the notifications centre.
    The next heading is called "Alerts". This is followed by a series of buttons that tell iOS where you will allow notifications from an app to appear. Double tapping any of these buttons will change its state to selected or unselected. Before the button's name, you'll hear the term "selected" read out if you have set it to Selected. The first of these buttons either allows or disallows alerts from the Aira app to appear on the lock screen, which makes them readable even when your device is locked. The next option determines whether notifications from Aira appear in the Notification Centre for later reading. The next button asks whether notifications from this app may appear as "banners". Banners appear on the screen Even when you're working in other apps. If you allow banners, the next button over will let you determine whether these are "temporary" or "persistent". Temporary banners appear only for a short time before disappearing. Persistent banners will need to be dismissed before they disappear, and you can continue your other activities. Double tapping on the Banner Style button will cause the two options to be visible, so you can choose between them. You can then hit the Back button at the top left.
    The next buttons determine whether you will allow sounds to be played, alerting you to a particular app's notifications. Many apps have their own unique notification sounds that play instead of the default alert tone. Next to this on-off toggle is another similar button that lets you choose whether "badges" can be used. App badges may include pictures or numbers, such as the number of waiting messages. The Fantastical app has a number of badge options picked from within the app itself. One of these is to display a number indicating the current day of the month.
    The next couple of options are under a heading called Options. The first allows you to choose a setting for notification previews that differs from the default setting. This way, you can selectively allow or disallow previews for key apps, rather than having to have all of them be tied to the overall choice made in the first setting. The final setting has to do with how and whether notifications from a given app are grouped to make them easier to manage efficiently. Some apps like Facebook, Twitter, Mail, etc., can generate an awful lot of notifications. This setting takes you to a range of choices regarding putting notifications from this app into a group of their own, or not to group them at all. The default choice is "automatic", which lets artificial intelligence figure out how notifications should be grouped for you.
Scheduled Notifications Summaries:
One very nice new technique for dealing with the flood of notifications one might receive daily is the generation of scheduled summaries. These can appear in your notifications centre at times when it's convenient for you. The "scheduled summary" setting is found at the very start of the notifications settings. You are able to pick the best times to have these summaries generated and announced to you. While artificial intelligence on your device arranges the notifications in what it thinks is the most optimal order, you have full control of what apps can add to these summaries. Each app has an on or off toggle, which can be found in the "apps in summary" group in side the scheduled summary settings. You can sort the list of apps alphabetically or by the number of average daily notifications they generate. If an app doesn't deliver notifications to the summary, you will still see its notifications in the notifications centre. All that is affected by summary related settings is the actual summary itself.
    When you double tap on a summary in the notifications centre, it expands, and you're able to flick right through various notifications. Double tap on any which interests you to look at the full notification. It is now in focus, so you can double tap on it, flick up or down, etc. You don't need to leave the summary and find a notification in the centre to interact with it. The order in which notifications appear is determined by artificial intelligence on your device. It tries to learn based on your activities throughout the day to figure out what is likely most important for you. 
Managing Notifications From Inside Apps:
The settings discussed above are on a macro level. If you want to decide whether an app displays its notifications with persistent banners, Notifications settings is where you make such choices. However, you should also look inside individual apps for options specific to that particular app. Many apps have more unique configuration or preference options found inside the app itself rather than in the general settings app. In particular, look for a "more" tab or a settings button. Going into that tab or double tapping that button will reveal these options. If apps generate many notifications, this is where you may find options dealing with when or in what circumstances notifications are generated.
    The Fantastical app I mentioned in passing earlier is an example of an app which has its own additional settings which control the circumstances that generate notifications in the first place. You can, for instance, decide whether appointment alerts happen and how early they might appear. You can decide whether event alerts generate sounds. X is another case in point. Personally, I don't need to know when someone chooses to follow me. However, I might want to know when I'm mentioned or when a certain person tweets. To configure this, I need to go into the Twitter app and into their push notification settings.
    Not all apps offer this kind of control. It depends on the app developer. However, in my experience, it's always good to check in an app for extra options regarding notifications which may offer unique customization relevant to that particular app.
Thoughts on Notifications:
Apple has made positively massive strides in iOS 15 when it comes to letting the user be the master of what can interrupt one's life. There was a time when things were much more about what advertisers and app developers wanted your notification experience to be. You could take steps, but it was a bit like pulling teeth. Now, with the additions to notifications settings and the new focus feature, things have turned a very positive corner. You have a meaningful amount of easy control without needing to jump through hoops.
    To get the most out of notifications, take the time to go through the notifications settings for each app you have. Think what you normally want to have from that app in terms of notifications and set that as your baseline. The artificial intelligence on your device will make decisions about which notifications to group to minimize clutter. Remember that you can always go into the notifications settings for a particular app and turn off grouping, so the notifications appear individually. Once you've made a change in this area, it will be remembered. So will all adjustments you make in notifications settings. As time passes, you'll find yourself visiting the notifications settings less often as you optimize things. Don't forget to take advantage of the ability to take apps out of immediate delivery and schedule notifications to be included in summaries. That in itself can really cut back on unexpected interruptions. Take advantage of sounds rather than banners if you just want to know about the existence of a new notification in an app. That won't pull you completely out of whatever you're doing when a notification arrives.
    The focus feature makes it possible to build a stable foundation in notifications settings. Use the focus feature to build focus modes which make the changes to your normal operation that different circumstances demand without needing to change notifications settings. This lets you only allow the interruptions you actually want at any given time with a minimum of fuss. Over time, you'll make small adjustments to really optimize all of this. The result should be a system of interlocked settings which require very little maintenance that keeps interruptions to those which you desire.
    Respecting your privacy is an increasingly important pillar for Apple's branding. This has certainly formed a core part of the changes in iOS 15. App developers are going to have to win your trust and offer more substantial reasons for you to opt into their notifications. I would advise my readers to be on the lookout for more settings within apps themselves, giving you more control over when and why apps notify you of things. This kind of custom notifications settings are also increasingly found in Apple's own apps. For instance, the News app has settings in the "following" tab under the "manage" heading which let you customize which news channels send you notifications. I was informed of this in a dialogue which popped up when I first entered that tab. However, not all developers will be so conscientious. Look around your apps carefully for any such options which may be buried in settings which aren't as obvious as they might be.
    As the system learns more about your interests, the notification summaries will become increasingly useful. The onboard artificial intelligence will optimize the order of notifications. This use of artificial intelligence will likely be expanded to other aspects of dealing with notifications as time goes on. 
    I hope this section gives you a good start in understanding your options regarding notifications. Your device will feel more like your own as you take control of interruptions and distractions. Notifications can be a gold mine of concise information relevant to your unique interests if you set things up correctly. There are enough tools to do this very effectively now.

Guard Against Distraction With Focusses:
I sat on my balcony one afternoon working on segment notes for that week's contribution to the Kelly and Company show. I was covering the latest Sherlock Holmes drama released by Big Finish. They do fantastic audio dramas and I wanted to do this one justice. I sat in very welcome and rare tranquility. It was so nice to be free of the near constant construction noise in and around my apartment building. The breeze was gentle and there were no pesky wasps. People without hearing aids might not appreciate how truly unnerving those can be when they fly past your head directly over one.
    Sara and I had thoroughly enjoyed this Holmes drama. I tried to think back to all the different dramas I had heard over the years which featured the legendary Holmes and Watson. How did I want to frame this new entry against past releases? I began to think back. However, before I got very far in my recollections, I was interrupted by a notification from a game called Sonar Islands. Being blissfully unaware of my keen concentration, the game blithely chose to inform me that an upgrade to one of my islands was now complete. One of my treasure chests could now contain more gold and generate gold coins more quickly than before. The temptation to abandon my efforts and play the game was easily set aside. That extra gold would take time to accumulate. Knowing about this development gave me absolutely no immediate advantage in the game. Alas, in an unstoppable tide, other associated thoughts came hard on the heels of that distraction. There was the excellent version of Treasure Island which Big Finish had produced. Any mention of an island is more than likely to bring to my mind's ear a snatch of that production. I'll hear a line or two from Ben Gunn or Long John Silver. "Fifteen men on a dead man's chest..." It was available to me with a few swipes and taps in the Big Finish app. There were, of course, many of the Sherlock Holmes dramas I had been contemplating. I could listen to any of them just as easily, having collected them over the years via Audible. Call it procrastinative research. And then, there was the upcoming season of Survivors. I had enjoyed that show in the past and could easily use Google to look up information about where things stood. With some effort, I pulled my thoughts back on task without invoking the king of all search engines and going down that rabbit hole. It took a good five minutes to really get back into the zone and typing out my thoughts on seamstress of Peckham Rye.
    There were a myriad of other interruptions during that warm Summer afternoon. Most of them were things I was genuinely interested in and glad to know about. I simply wished I could have waited to find out about them until after I had done my segment notes. Both my wife and I were waiting for packages, so I didn't feel good about using the "do not disturb" feature. This choice ultimately proved a good one, as the packages actually did arrive that afternoon.
    On that particular day, I got numerous scam calls from an infernally annoying fellow trying to interest me in duct cleaning. I also received a very welcome call from an old friend. None of the businesses, media outlets or people had set out to thwart my progress. Even the duct cleaning scammer from Hell had no idea that I was trying to get serious work done. It was simply one of those days when the universe itself seemed bent on denying me peaceful progress. I needed something more flexible to more effectively deal with incoming calls and information than what I had at the time.
    Although unleashed by outside notifications and callers, the level of my ongoing distraction was as much due to the ease with which I could satisfy my stirred curiosities or temptations. I'm far from the only one to face this. It was why employers insisted on people not using their personal smartphones for work or monitored their performance in other ways during work time.
    Apple has begun introducing features to help us set boundaries for ourselves and others who want to contact us. They hope to make that process as easy and painless as possible. People, myself included, were finding themselves too often tempted, too easily distracted, and too available to others wanting our attention.
    The Focus feature introduced in iOS 15 is Apple's most ambitious attempt so far to deal with this problem. It allows people to create and choose from different focus options, which limit the apps and people who are able to disturb you. Rather than an all or nothing toggle, Focus lets you customize which apps and people can break through to you with notifications or calls. Where "Do not disturb" was a club, the Focus feature now presents us with a much more precise scalpel. We can eliminate the distractions we don't want while allowing critical time sensitive information through. This extends to allowing us to select which home screens are available to us while in a given focus. This puts in an extra step to go through to make that tempting game or social media app on screen five available. Combined with the new ability for notifications to be delivered in a summary when you decide, people now have a much stronger and more versatile set of options to avoid missing out on information while minimizing distraction. They can truly have the best of both worlds.
Setting up Focus Choices:
There are two major parts to the Focus feature. The main one is in settings. There, you'll find the new "Focus" setting a flick to the right of "sounds and haptics" or one flick left of "screen time". Double tapping on this will put you in a strip of options. At the top, under the "focus" heading, you'll find an "Add" button. This lets you create a brand-new focus mode. Next to this, you'll find any focus modes which are already present. The very first is that old reformed soul, called "do not disturb". Rather than simply being an on or off toggle, it is now a focus mode. There are also sample modes for work and sleep. The Sleep focus mode is special since it integrates with your sleep schedule set up in the Health app. All of these can be customized to suit your precise needs. To the right of these, you'll find a basic description of what the focus feature does. Finally, there is a toggle switch to decide whether turning on focus modes with the device you're currently using is shared across other devices. If you have more than one Apple device, this lets you choose whether each device will change its focus to the same as all other devices. This makes certain that my Apple Watch knows to go into the sleep focus I've customized for bedtime. However, since I don't want my iPhone XR responding to focus changes now that it's a backup phone, I've turned this option off on it. This means that I can turn on the "do not disturb" focus on my iPhone 13 and Apple Watch without changing the focus on my XR.
    Now, let's explore what happens when you double tap on a focus. We'll use "do not disturb" as our example. This is basically built to act like the "do not disturb" setting, which has been replaced by the "Focus" setting. It is what people who really would rather not fiddle with other focus modes are likely to gravitate to. The first thing you'll find is an on or off toggle switch. Simply double tap it to change its state. The next thing to the right is a heading called "allowed notifications". Under this heading, you'll find options to decide who can call you and what apps can disturb you while this focus mode is active. Each button, the first for people and the next for apps, puts you into a dialogue where you make the necessary decisions. It's actually the very same dialogue. In it, you'll find "people" and "apps" buttons. You can use these to change your attention to either area until you're happy with all the options in the dialogue.
    When "people" is selected, the first button is after the word "allow". It is a "remove all" button letting you erase any allowances you've made, returning the focus to exclude all interruptions from people. The next button allows you to add people to a list of people who are allowed to contact you. Double tapping this button will get you into your contacts list, where you can double tap on a person to add him or her. Any calls or messages from that person will then be let through, even when this focus is active. Next to this is "also allow". The button found to the right of these words will let you determine what to do with people inside or outside your contact list who you haven't specifically added to the list of allowed people for that focus mode. There are options to allow calls from everyone, no one, only people in your contacts, only people marked as favourite. You'll also find an option whether to allow repeated calls. If someone calls more than once during a three-minute period, that second call can be let through.
    For me, allowing calls from favourites does the trick here. These include family members and other numbers such as my apartment buzzer which works through my phone. This greatly reduces any unimportant calls which I don't want to deal with while in the "do not disturb" focus mode.
    Now, let's turn our attention to apps. As with people, the first button lets you remove all the apps you may have added, thereby eliminating any mistakes and letting you start again. The next button is "add app" and is pretty self-explanatory. You're presented with a list of your apps and can add whatever app you want. Notifications from these apps will be let through. Any apps added will appear to the right of the "add app" button. Next, like with people, you'll find "also allow" and an option to let apps not on your allowed list pass you time sensitive notifications while you're in this focus mode.
    I'm very selective about which apps I will allow to interrupt me. Any shopping and package tracking apps are on my list of allowed apps. News, games, and social media apps are excluded. This minimizes the chance that I will be needlessly interrupted, while still allowing people who urgently need to contact me to do so.
    Going past the "allowed notifications" heading contents, we come to another heading called "Options". Beneath this heading, we will find settings governing other aspects of a focus mode. The first is the focus status. This lets you choose whether you want other people to be informed that you're in a particular focus mode, should they try to contact you. If you turn the status on, they would get a message like "Michael is reading now. Send anyway?" They can still send you a message, but will hopefully realize from the name of the focus mode that you won't necessarily respond right away. Messages and calls from people not on your allowed list will still be delivered. Calls will go to your voicemail automatically. Messages will arrive in your messaging app. The notifications which normally alert you to this and interrupt you simply don't happen.
    Next, there are "home screen" and "lock screen" buttons. With the "home screen" button, you are taken to settings which let you decide whether notification badges are hidden or displayed. An example might be the badge which shows how many unread messages are in your email inbox. The next option lets you decide whether you want to only make certain home screens available while you're in this focus mode. Any selected pages are shown. Any unselected are hidden until you leave the focus mode.
    Using the app library, it is actually possible to build home screens of particular apps which will only be shown when a particular focus mode is active. Simply copy the apps you desire from the app library onto the extra page, which is always present in the edit mode. When you have all the desired apps on this new home screen, you'll note that any apps you used on other home screens haven't gone away. You've simply created new icons for that particular home screen which point to the same apps. You could, via this means, construct a special home screen with all the apps you need for work and create a focus mode which only lets you access that home screen of apps while it's active.
    In my Work focus mode, I hide every home screen beyond the first three, except the fifth. That fifth home screen contains all the apps used for package delivery tracking and shopping. With all other home screens hidden, this fifth screen becomes the fourth while in my Work focus mode. These plus any apps in the dock contain any apps I'm likely to need, but hide home screens full of games and social media. When I turn off this focus mode, I am once again able to reach all ten of my home screens. The fifth screen is back in its usual place and all the games are back in easy reach.
    For the lock screen, you can decide whether it will be dimmed while in a particular focus. You can also choose to show notifications on the lock screen, or have them not shown at all while you're in this focus mode. This overrides any settings for notifications you might have, generally making it much easier to reduce visual and auditory distractions from your locked phone when you really need to. Romantic dinners, work meetings and many other occasions come to mine. Simply deactivate the focus mode and your normal notifications settings will be back in effect.
    Apple Intelligence can play a role in focusses as of iOS 18. You can turn on a new switch found at the top of the settings for each focus. It's called intelligence in silencing. This will allow Apple Intelligence to make decisions about what it considers high-priority notifications from apps which you haven't specifically allowed or disallowed to interrupt you. If it judges a notification to be something which you'd rather be interrupted by, it will alert you to that notification. As Apple gains confidence in its artificial intelligence, we are likely to find more additions to the focus settings as time goes on.
    The final heading in the settings for a specific focus is "turn on automatically". The options in this area let you add triggers which activate the focus, so you don't have to think about doing this manually. Choices for triggers include times of day, the use of certain apps, and arriving at or leaving specific locations. For instance, the bedtime I set in the health settings is the automatic trigger from the Sleep focus mode. This mode is somewhat more stringent in keeping people and notifications from bothering me than others. You can trigger both the activation and deactivation of a focus mode. My sleep mode turns off at five A.M.
    Keep in mind that focus modes aren't meant to truly stop you from doing something you want to do. You're never trapped in a focus mode. You can manually activate or deactivate a focus mode easily whenever you wish. The intent is merely to prevent you from being unwillingly distracted. Focus modes introduce a small amount of friction to give you a moment's pause before you abandon yourself to whatever temptation or distraction beckons.
    Focus modes can have more than one automatic trigger so that they activate without your needing to take that step. You might, for example, create a focus mode for when you're reading which activates when you use any book reading app like Kindle or Voice Dream Reader. You could disallow notifications entirely, thereby preventing you from being interrupted and losing your place in a Kindle book being read by VoiceOver. The focus might, however, let family members or other select people get through to you. If you have a specific time frame during which you are working, these triggers can make certain that the focus activates. You are always informed when a focus turns on or off by an announcement from VoiceOver. This may change, as there has been some debate about whether such announcements are actually desirable or not.
    Each kind of automatic trigger has options specific to the type of trigger you're creating. For time triggers, you are able to use pickers to set start and stop times. There are also buttons for each day of the week, which you can select or deselect to indicate if you want days when the focus doesn't turn on automatically. VoiceOver hints will help beginners greatly in this area if they are enabled.
    Similarly, you can add apps to a focus. When you choose this, you are taken to a dialogue with a list of all of your apps. Double tap on the app that you want to be a trigger for the focus. Only one app can be added at a time. To add another app, go back into the dialogue and select another. Each app will then be a trigger.
    Adding a location makes use of a dialogue which has a search field at the top to put in an address. The current address where your device thinks you are is offered as a default. Once an address is selected, arriving at the address will turn the focus on, while leaving it will turn it off. Keep in mind that due to many circumstances, the accuracy of where your device thinks you are can vary greatly. Being indoors drastically limits GPS signal reception, limiting accuracy. Turning Wi-Fi off can also effect location accuracy. Be mindful of this when creating location-based triggers for a focus mode.
    Using the "add focus" button at the start of "focus" settings lets you create a focus mode from scratch. You'll be asked to give your focus mode a name and taken through the steps discussed above. This process is nicely divided into steps, where you need to use the "next" button to proceed to the following group of choices until you've done everything necessary. One of these choices is the colour or type of icon shown on the status bar when you're in that focus mode.
    Any such triggers you create will be shown in the "turn on automatically" section of the focus settings. To remove a trigger, double tap on it and flick to the right until you come to "delete automation". Double tap this, and it will be removed after asking if you're certain. Removing an entire focus mode is very similar. Go into the focus mode settings, flick right to the end, and you'll find a "delete focus" button which you can double tap.
    Setting up focus modes is much more convenient than needing to adjust notifications for various occasions or times of day every time you need things to behave differently. Simply create a new focus or customize the ones already present as needed. They can trigger automatically or be manually turned on and off. We will now discuss taking manual control of focus modes. This is my preferred method for handling the focus feature almost all of the time. My only current exception is the sleep focus, which is automatically activated at my chosen bedtime and turned off early in the morning.
The Focus Control Centre Button:
To take manual control of focus modes, you can always go into the Focus settings. The first thing in the settings for a particular focus mode is an on/off switch. More advanced users will find this a cumbersome approach, as numerous swipes and taps are needed to get to that one switch to activate or deactivate a focus mode. Furthermore, you're likely to lose your place in whatever app you were in before deciding to change the focus mode of your device.
    If all you want to do is select, activate or deactivate a focus mode, there's a far more efficient alternative. You can access your various focus modes via the "Focus" button in the control centre. In my experience, this makes certain that you don't lose your place in whatever app you're in. The Focus button can be found to the right of the "volume" slider. If you double tap on it, you toggle the focus mode you last used on and off. When it's on, the button in the control centre will read "focus selected do not disturb" or whatever the name of the active focus mode happens to be. If no special focus mode is active, the button simply reads as "focus button".
    To choose a different focus, do a one finger triple tap on the focus button to reach the focus chooser. This is a small menu containing all available focus modes. At the far-right end, you'll find a "new focus" button which takes you to the focus creation procedure also found in the focus settings. This makes manually selecting and turning focus modes on or off a breeze once you get the hang of it. Double tap on the focus you want. It will then be selected and turned on. Double tap on the focus again to deselect and turn it off. The last focus you do this to will be the focus you can more quickly turn on or off by simply double tapping the focus button in the control centre. When finished with the focus chooser, simply hit the home button or do the gesture used to reach the home screen, and you'll be returned to the focus button on the control centre. Use the home button or gesture once more to return to your app or wherever you were before, wanting to change the focus mode.
    While on the focus button in the control centre, you have even more options. If you flick down while on the "focus" button, you'll hear "open controls". Double tap this and flick right to go over a selection of choices which relate to the currently selected focus. For instance, if "do not disturb" is the current ready focus, you'd see options which let you turn it on for lengths of time, or until another condition has been met. For instance, you could turn on "do not disturb" for one hour or until you leave your current location. That's quite a lot of control available from that single unassuming little "Focus" button found in the control centre.
    Here's a good example of the advantage of using the focus button and chooser rather than going into focus settings. At around ten after two on most Thursday afternoons, I get a Skype call from the Kelly and Company show. It's time to do my segment on accessible technology and audio entertainment. I answer the call and the sound technician makes certain everything's sounding good. The show is on a break and time is ticking. Long before this point, I've taken a moment to triple tap the focus button and make certain that do not disturb is the selected focus. After I get the call, things need to go quickly and smoothly. I really don't want to be interrupted while I'm live on national television, even if only in audio. Moreover, it's important that I have time to get ready with my notes and Braille display. I go into the control centre and do a one finger double tap on the focus button. This toggles on the last focus mode I selected, which is do not disturb. My iPhone then says, "selected focus, do not disturb". The focus mode is now active, and I should be safe from needless interruption. Since I haven't entered the focus chooser, it takes only one home gesture to get back to the app I was previously in. That's Skype, which was used to answer the call. I then use the app switching four finger swipe to the right, which takes me to the app I was previously in, which is Ulysses. If all goes well, I'm now in Ulysses with my notes ready to go and safe from interruptions. Setting the focus has taken perhaps five seconds. I'm now free to get into best position in my notes and turn off speech, so it doesn't distract me while I read the notes on my Braille display. My hands won't ever have to leave the Braille display after this point until my segment concludes, and I'm done with my notes.
    At the end of my segment, I turn VoiceOver speech back on. I go back into the control centre and then double tap the focus button to deactivate do not disturb. The focus button now has nothing selected and simply reads as "focus button" when flicked over. I know I'm back in my normal mode of operation with no active focus modes. Typically, you won't have to switch between apps and will just be back in the app you were working in before deciding to turn a focus mode on or off. This took a while to read through, but actually doing this takes less than ten seconds. It starts to feel natural rapidly once you get the hang of it.
    It would certainly be possible to make a trigger which automatically activated do not disturb whenever I went into Skype. However, in my experience, this sort of thing can lead to unintended situations. There are instances when I'm in a meeting on Zoom, but don't want to miss out on my apartment buzzer informing me of the arrival of a delivery person I'm expecting. It's the same with causing my Work focus mode to trigger whenever I'm in the Fantastical or Ulysses apps. There are times when I wish to use these work related apps but don't want to cut myself off from notifications or contact. The same kind of hangups can occur with time or location-based automation triggers. Perhaps, I'm up late one night. If I was expecting a call or participating in online events, I would have to remember to turn off the sleep mode, so incoming notifications weren't blocked automatically. For me, taking manual control has been the best way to roll with the focus feature so far in most instances.
Focus Thoughts and Tips:
The introduction of the Focus feature can do a lot to offset how tempting and distracting our iPhones can be. While they don't utterly lock anything out of reach, they add that bit of friction between us and temptations and distractions not needed at the moment. Often, this small amount of friction is all we need to keep on task and mentally present in the moment. The tradeoff between the easy simplicity of the "do not disturb" switch and the complexity of focus modes is, I think, a good one.
    Take the time to learn your way around before you really have to do this quickly under pressure. Practice going in and out of the control centre and taking that step deeper into the focus chooser. Think of the focus chooser as being a deeper layer of the control centre. It takes two home gestures or home button presses to come back out to the home screens. With the focus button, it really helps to get a sense of where it's located on the control centre screen. That way, you can put your finger right near the spot and flick left or right to quickly get to the button. That's the most likely place where you might get flustered if you're in a time crunch. It's in the middle of the screen. To the left of it are brightness and volume controls, so you have one or two flicks to the right if you hear yourself touch either of those. Immediately to the right is the space where controls for any connected accessories are shown. If you touch in that area, a flick left should get you to the focus button.
    Even for beginners, the time spent mastering the focus settings, control centre button and chooser will be richly rewarded. The one thing to remember to check on is that control centre button. If it just says, "focus button" when you flick to it and nothing else, that means that no focus mode is active. You won't miss out on anything unintentionally as long as this is the case. The focus button will always indicate if a focus mode such as "do not disturb" is selected. Using this button quickly became second nature for me. I only need to go into the focus settings when I actually want to change the characteristics or triggers of a focus mode. However, some beginners may prefer to go into the focus settings, double tap on the focus they want, and double tap on the on/off toggle to be certain they know what state it's in. As usual, Apple has left more than one way to accomplish the same thing. It's a matter of practice and convenience.
    Focus modes never block access to the notification centre. You can visit the notification centre at any time to see what's new. When you consider the new notification immediacy settings and the summaries generated for you at times of your choosing, your fear of missing out on desirable information should be minimal.
    I hope this helps blind people make good use of this compelling new feature in iOS. It has proved to be a real blessing for me as I work on finishing the second edition of this guide. Once this pandemic has been better dealt with, it will be even more helpful when it comes to blocking off distractions while navigating outdoors, among other things. These devices have become the gateway to so many things that being able to control how widely open the gateway is has become a real necessity. With iOS 15, Apple has risen admirably to this challenge in many ways, including this focus feature.

Keep on Track With Lifestyle Apps:
With their extreme portability, iOS devices are uniquely positioned to be of help in many ways. From working out your share of a bill at a restaurant table with the handy calculator app, to keeping track of appointments with the included calendar app, you'll be surprised how much you can do with apps that are automatically included with iOS. These are useful in everyday life and are helpful for students. These apps are simple and offer basic functionality. Beginners can feel comfortable practicing their skills using VoiceOver and exploring the screen. Also, since they don't involve communication with anyone apart from your faithful digital assistant, there's no major worry about doing something which might lead to embarrassment. 
    Should you need more functionality or a different approach to these everyday tasks than the included apps offer, fear not. Chances are that you can get a more suitable app for your needs in the app store. I've found many apps offering alternative approaches that suit me better. The major advantages of the apps discussed here are their less complex nature and that they come pre-installed on your device. Both of these aspects are especially good for beginners.
    For lack of a better category term, I'm calling these "lifestyle" apps, since they are useful in everyday situations. Calling them utilities just doesn't seem quite right. Other apps which might very well fall under this category happen to be better fits for examples of apps in other categories. For instance, the Contacts, Messages, and Health apps have the same kind of "useful anywhere" feel. The apps I present to you below are less easy to fit in other categories and thus needed their own.
    Before we take a closer look at the lifestyle apps, remember that you can use Siri, Apple's built-in personal assistant, to perform many of the tasks these apps can do. In fact, Siri makes use of these apps on your behalf and gives beginners a nice level of control over what happens. If you tell Siri to create a reminder or appointment, it will be done using the Calendar or Reminders app that comes standard in iOS. This is particularly handy for beginners who may initially struggle with navigating and typing on a touchscreen. You'll find a section about Siri earlier in this guide.
    Learning the layouts and options in the apps themselves will lead to more in-depth control and a better overview of things like the monthly calendar. You'll be able to take advantage of more advanced aspects of-these apps. A good example is creating a recurring event in the calendar which doesn't use a standard interval of time. It really pays to learn how to use the touchscreen.
    Now, we'll examine the lifestyle apps that are provided by Apple in greater detail. These are all safe for beginners to experiment with. By doing this, you will gain familiarity with VoiceOver gestures and become more proficient with navigating around various screens. Currently, apps in this category include Weather, Calculator, Reminders, Calendar, Clock, Voice Memos and Journal. Information on the Notes app can now be found in the Work and Productivity section of the guide. While it's easy to make use of the Notes app, it has gained a lot of power and complexity over the past few years. The calendar might well have made a similar move, but there is still more of a distinction between its capabilities and those of apps more suitable for more complex business project and event management.
The Weather App:
No information is as useful every day than the weather. Apple has included a Weather app which comes installed as part of iOS. It provides good basic weather information which is likely to meet the needs of average users. You'll find daily and hourly forecasts. Upcoming precipitation is shown. Air quality and ultraviolet strength information will help you determine what protection you might need. You'll also find information about visibility, wind conditions, wind chill factor, sunrise and sunset times, and more.
    This app is fairly easy to navigate. Certainly, people can flick through the information for their location and gain a good idea of what to expect from the weather. Doing things this way, you won't miss out on anything. However, there's a faster way to jump through the different kinds of information offered on the main screen.
    There's a bit of a learning curve to using this app efficiently. Different portions of the weather information available for a location are stacked in a series of containers. Turn the rotor to the "containers" option, and you can quickly flick up or down between them.
    At the very top of the screen, you'll find the current weather conditions for the location you're in or that you have set as the default. All information related to a location is found on one vertically stacked screen.
    Below the current conditions, you'll find a container which will have any warnings if any conditions like wind or precipitation is present or expected soon in the day. The next container holds a more detailed forecast broken down by hour for the rest of the day. Below this, you'll find the next container with a ten-day forecast.
    There are buttons in some containers which let you access more detailed information, maps, or more extensive charts. For instance, each hour forecast in the hourly breakdown is actually a button. Double tapping on that will bring you to a more extensive screen which lets you focus in on the kind of information you want. On that screen, you can pick the day using a calendar slider near the top. You can focus on conditions, precipitation, humidity, air quality, etc using the button labelled "conditions" by default. You can also find buttons letting you choose whether actual temperature is shown or the "feels like" temperature. This detailed screen contains explanations as well as other information like precipitations mounts. Check for additional containers rather than presuming the first bunch of information you encounter is all there is.
    On the main screen, you'll find links and buttons letting you access maps. They can show temperature and precipitation for many locations.
    Flicking through the list of containers, you can find information on sunset and sunrise times, ultraviolet index, what the temperature feels like, rainfall, visibility, humidity, wind, and pressure. As usual, just use the rotor to navigate to different containers and then flick right to go over the information in that container. The air quality compares current conditions to the day before. It has a button called "see more" which gives you more information about the air quality scale and main pollutants. That might be helpful for allergy sufferers or people worried about things like smoke or smog.
    There are some important controls in the app. If you're in container navigation mode, you'll get to them right after the last container. You can also reach these at any time by touching near the bottom middle of the screen. The controls will let you report an issue with the app. Furthermore, you can access a list of locations where you can add more or remove locations from favourites. You can also manage notifications for locations, including your current location and any in your favourites.
    Look at information for different locations by using a three finger swipe to the left or right. This will switch you between any locations you have set up. Presuming you allow location services to track you, it's possible to have the Weather app automatically default to your current location as you move around. There's a slider containing any locations you've chosen to include in your favourites. Once you're on the slider, flick up or down to move between locations. Flicking left or right lets you reach the various controls. To the left of the locations list, you'll find a button letting you manage notifications. These can alert you to snow, rain and other changes in the weather. You can have them on or off for any location in your favourites. Flicking right of the location slider gets you to the location list. This is where you can add or remove locations from your favourites.
    There are some settings. You can pick whether you want Celsius or Fahrenheit. You can also decide which units to use when measuring amounts of precipitation. There aren't any other settings to select different units of measurement for pressure or anything like that.
    When you come to charts, it is possible to have VoiceOver describe them or use sound to give an audio representation. When you move onto a chart, the rotor will turn automatically to the right setting. Flick down, and you'll hear options to describe a chart, summarize it, or give an audio representation. Double tap on what you want and it will happen. After you're done, don't forget to turn the rotor back to the "containers" setting.
    For basic use of the Weather app, that's all you need to know. Taking the time to thoroughly explore and double tap on elements will yield even more rewards.
    Compared to third party weather apps, Apple offers a free alternative which offers enough information for the needs of average users. For weather enthusiasts or people who want more, there's a lot to decide from. You may need to pay a one-time fee or an ongoing subscription. However, presuming that's no object, there is a wide selection of apps which offer all kinds of different options. Some are very accessible to VoiceOver. Two of the most popular are fully accessible. Weather Gods distinguishes itself by providing soundscapes to match the current weather or the future weather you might be viewing in a forecast. Meanwhile, Carrot Weather delivers your information with a user adjustable amount of snark. There are many other options to consider. There's bound to be something which meets your weather needs.
The Calculator:
Everyday life is full of mathematics. From calculating tips in a restaurant to figuring out your budget, numbers pop up everywhere you go. To handle the kind of math problems most of us are likely to encounter, Apple has provided the Calculator app. This app is included in iOS and will likely fill the mathematical needs of most people reasonably well. The calculator works well with VoiceOver.
    In iOS 18, the calculator received a major upgrade. It has three different modes. Unlike earlier, you can use these modes in any orientation. These modes are basic, scientific, and math notes. A comprehensive collection of unit conversions is available in any of these modes. These include conversion between currencies. To access these options, you'll find a "change mode" button at the bottom left of the screen.
    The basic mode has the addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and percent functions.
    The scientific mode reveals a far more robust scientific calculator with many functions. Though somewhat harder to navigate, the reward for mastering it is a pretty good scientific calculator.
    The math notes mode allows you to deal with more complex equations. You can define and use variables, and the results will be kept up to date as you enter information.
    Unit conversions can be turned on or off in the "change mode" menu of choices which pop up when the button is pressed. These increase how cluttered the screen is since there are controls to choose the units to be converted. The basic mode without unit conversions on is the simplest configuration to start with.
Basic Mode:
Functions included in the basic mode are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percent.
    You'll find a numeric keypad at the left of the screen, covering most of the surface. Lower digits are at the bottom and higher are at the top. The decimal is right of 0. Equals is right of decimal.
    Above the equals sign, you'll find functions proceeding up the far right of the screen. Edition, subtraction, multiplication, and division at the top. Above the 7, 8, and 9 keys are Change Sign, clear, plus-minus, and percent keys. Above this is where the results are shown. VoiceOver automatically announces results. You can also read them more carefully with the rotor after touching the result space.
    The layout is simple and uncluttered enough to be mastered quickly. Very handy for most day to day stuff. Keys are placed where they would be if you were using a physical calculator of similar size. They are well sized and spaced, making this an excellent way to become proficient at finding the proper keys.
    Suppose you want to know how many minutes there are in a year. You would go into the Calculator app. Next, you would double tap on 3, 6, and 5 for the number of days in a year. You would then touch along the far-right side of the screen. Keeping your finger on the screen, slide it up or down until you find the "multiply" option. It is more towards the top of the screen. Once you find it, lift your finger and double tap the Multiplication button. If you're using touch typing, just lift your finger, and it will be entered. Next, you would enter the 24 hours in each day by double tapping on the 2 and 4 digits. Next, you would touch along the right side and slide your finger to find the "multiply" key again. Lift it or double tap to enter that operation, and then enter 6 and 0 for the number of minutes in each hour. Finally, touch near the bottom-right corner of the screen and slide your finger until you find the Equals button. Lift your finger, and you will hear the result, learning that there are, in fact, 525,600 minutes in a year.
    After some practice, you'll find your speed increasing as you develop a muscle memory for where various calculator functions are. I still tend to slide my finger to the right function, even after all these years. However, the basic layout of the Calculator app is a good place to begin to experience how building a mental map of where things are on the touchscreen increases your speed and efficiency.
The Scientific Calculator:
The scientific calculator has many more functions on the screen. The basic functions are all still there, but are condensed onto a small area on the right side of the screen. To the left of the numbers, you'll find the rest of the screen taken up by all sorts of higher math functions. This includes parentheses, geometric functions, exponents, and lots more.
    This layout will take longer to master, as it crams a lot more onto the screen. I recommend the use of touch typing mode. Set this with the rotor. This way, nothing is entered until you lift your finger from the surface of your device. This gives you a chance to feel around for the right digit or function and makes entry mistakes less likely. The numbers and other basic functions are crammed into a small section on the right side of the screen. There's a line for results which stretches across the top. Beneath it are a lot of functions including parentheses, exponential, trigonometric, and many more.
Math Notes Mode:
This addition to the calculator's arsenal gives it the power to handle advanced equations with variables. This can happen in the Calculator app but can also happen in the Notes and Messages apps.
    Let's use a simple example with three variables. I created a new math note using the new note button. In the text area, I typed three lines. The first line was:
    l=3
    The next was w=1500
    The next line was t=lw
    If I then entered t= on the next line, it would compute the result for me. If I changed what L or W equaled, it would update the result of t.
    The above was just a simple example. You can have many variables in your equations. All of which will be updated as you make any changes.
    If you turn on unit conversions, you'll find two buttons called input unit and result unit near the top right of the screen. The input unit button is above the result unit button. To the left of these, you'll find the input number once you've entered that using the keys. It's easiest to select your units first. There are all kinds of choices when you hit the input or result unit buttons. Everything from weights, distances, information units, and a great many more. Once you've selected your units of conversion, enter the number you want to convert.
    All of the changes I've outlined above have turned a once humble calculator into a real powerhouse of a tool which is likely to meet the needs of most users. I will almost certainly never need any mathematical capability which isn't offered here. For people working in fields involving higher order mathematics, there are plenty of even more powerful calculator apps to be found in the app store. I steer you to some accessible alternatives in the Work and Productivity section later in this guide.
The Clock App:
This app packs multiple handy time tools into a single app. It includes a world clock, an alarm clock, a timer, and a stopwatch. Each of these functions have their own tab. From a blindness perspective, there are a few unfortunately missing abilities. There is no way to tell time through vibration feedback like with the Apple Watch. Also, there is no facility to set chimes. For these abilities, you will need to acquire third-party apps. A more expensive alternative would be to obtain an Apple Watch, which does a great deal more than simply let you tell time in various ways.
The World Clock:
The leftmost tab at the bottom of the screen accesses this clock, which can display the current time in many cities around the world. The Edit button is found at the top left of the screen. Double tapping this brings you to an edit mode that lets you arrange the order cities are displayed in, as well as delete cities you don't want. Double tap and hold on the Reorder button next to a city's name, and slide your finger up or down to move it. Hit the Done button when you're finished.
    The Add button is one flick right of the words "World Clock". It lets you add new cities from a large list. You may not find your particular city, but you'll find one close enough. I have Toronto; Cupertino, California; and London, England on my world clock. Helpful for catching online events like webinars, Internet radio shows, or Apple presentations.
    On the iPad, instead of a simple list of cities, there's a world map. You can feel or flick through the cities, but you'll find more information shown, including sunrise and sunset times. All of this may prove useful, particularly for travellers.
The Alarm Clock
This is an easy alarm clock to operate. You can create multiple alarms for various days and times. For each of them, you can choose which of them are on or off. Simply double tap on the alarm to toggle its state. If you no longer need an alarm, you can delete it by flicking down and then double tapping after you hear VoiceOver say "delete".
    You can add new alarms with the Add button. Simply double tap on the "add" button, and you'll be presented with an alarm creation screen. Flick up or down on the time units to quickly adjust to the time you want the alarm to sound. You can name the alarm if you wish. Also, you can pick the particular sound you want the alarm to make from a selection of options. When you're happy with the choices you've made, use the "save" button near the top left of the screen to save the alarm. It will then appear in the list of alarms available on the alarm clock tab.
    There's an Edit button at the top left. Use that to change the characteristics of alarms by double tapping on an alarm and flicking right through the various options. There are plenty of options including snooze, sound choice, etc., allowing quite a bit of latitude in constructing your alarm. You can select different sounds, any ringtones you have, or songs from your music library.
    There is a special alarm called "sleep wake up". This is a special alarm which ties into your sleep schedule, which you can set in the Health app. This alarm takes advantage of some special alarm sounds and haptic feedback to awaken you in the best possible way. It will activate on your Apple Watch if you have one. When you set the alarm time, you'll be told whether it meets with your sleep schedule requirements. You don't need to use this alarm, but it cannot be totally removed.
    I usually end up being awake before when I need to be. I have alarms set for early morning hours that I can quickly turn on if there's a special reason why I absolutely have to be up by a certain time. The sleep wake-up alarm has been useful every so often.
Stopwatch:
You can perform all stopwatch functions easily. No automatic reading of time is done, but you can easily check it by touching the screen near the middle. There's a heading at the top, so you can set the rotor to headings, flick up to get to the heading, and then flick right to get quickly to the stopwatch time. Double tapping the Lap button will quickly give you the current progress, reading the exact moment the button was pressed. There are also Stop and Reset buttons. You can find the time display and leave VoiceOver focussed on it for a running count.
Timer:
This is your basic timer. There are no announcements as the timer counts down. You can set the duration and choose the sound that plays when the timer expires. Also, you can decide to have it stop playback of whatever music, podcasts, etc., that you're listening to. Handy if apps don't have their own sleep timers.
    Like the stopwatch, you can check timer progress while in this tab of the clock app. Additionally, presuming nothing eclipses it, you can find the timer on the lock screen. Music track information can affect this, as track information seems to get priority.
    I frequently use the timer for tasks such as washing my laundry. Also, it is helpful when cooking meals. There are many uses for a simple timer in ordinary life.
The Voice Memos App:
Designed for quick note-taking and recording, this app has been upgraded in iOS 13. It can now name recordings made automatically based on where you're located when you make them. Also, it can save those recordings in one of two formats. By default, it uses a compressed but still relatively high-quality format. However, if desired, it can use a lossless format that captures the full spectrum of audio. This would be useful for creating recordings of settings where background ambient sound is desirable.
    The app is laid out very simply. There are buttons on the top left to let you go into folders, edit and create them. At the very bottom-right corner of the screen, there's a "Record" button. This lets you create new voice memos. Double tapping this button will start recording right away. A small beep will indicate this. To stop the recording, double tap with two fingers anywhere on the screen and the memo will be automatically saved. It will be given a default name based on where and when you recorded it. When you're on the memo in the list of memos, flick up or down to find other options, such as one letting you delete the memo. Double tap with one finger on a memo to put it in focus. You can then double tap on the title of the memo to change its name. Flicking to the right, you'll find more options, including controls for playing back the voice memo.
    As of iOS 18, it is now possible to have voice memos you record be automatically transcribed into text. These transcripts are available in the Notes app and can be searched using the Voice Memos or Notes apps.
    This is a straightforward app for beginners to learn by exploration and experimentation. There are settings to go with the Voice Memos app, which can be found in the Settings app. These let you choose the audio quality which your memos will be saved in. Lossless quality offers the best clarity and can be useful for recording the whole environment as well as your voice. Everything will be nice and clear. To save space, you can select compressed formats. There are also choices letting you decide how long memos are kept before being automatically deleted. You can also decide whether you want location-based naming or not to have that be done automatically.
    Think of the Voice Memos app as being a good basic digital recorder. For more involved audio recording and editing, there are plenty of choices in the app store. However, this app will be a good start for new users as they can easily record instructions or make their own voice notes while they master the virtual screen, dictating text notes, and typing.
The Calendar App:
The calendar app has a reasonably simple layout, keeping everything on one screen. No tabs are separating different areas like you'll find in other apps. Just keep in mind that this simplicity is partially achieved by hiding things away until they're actively revealed when needed. Starting at the very top left of the touchscreen below the status bar, you'll find the Search and Add buttons. These let you search for and add events to the calendar. At the bottom right are Today, Calendars, and Inbox buttons.
    So far, so good. However, things get a little tricky in the middle. The rest of the screen is taken up with a scrolling calendar. Years are separated by headings. Setting your rotor to the Headings setting will, therefore, let you scroll easily through years. Each month is a button, so flicking left or right goes backward or forward by month. You can scroll indefinitely backwards and forwards to past or future years. Touching a month at the top of the screen and flicking left won't get you to the Search and Add buttons, but will just keep scrolling. The same goes for when you're at the bottom of the screen and flick right. It takes a bit of getting used to. To reliably get to the option buttons, it's best to touch the top left or bottom right corners, landing you on the Search and Inbox buttons, respectively. You then flick right from the Search button or left from the Inbox button to reach the additional buttons.
    When you're at a month you want a closer look at, double tap on it. You will be taken into that month's calendar. In that calendar, each day is a button which can be double tapped. Once you have gone into a particular year, month or day, there will always be a "back" button at the top left of the screen to let you go back to a broader level. The current month and day are always indicated when you go over them in their respective level detail. There are no headings in the month calendar. However, each week has its own row of days. Turn the rotor to Vertical Navigation to move quickly through the weeks of a month by flicking up or down. This keeps you on the same day of the week. Double tap on a day to see events taking place on it. They appear at the bottom right, just before the Today button when the day is highlighted. However, you can get into an even more detailed daily view, where any events in a day are shown along with their times. You can navigate this list by heading or by a special "event" setting that appears on your rotor. Double tapping on an event will show all its details and any notes. For instance. St. George's Day is a holiday celebrated in some parts of Canada on April 23. A note included in the Canadian Holidays calendar indicates that it may not be celebrated in your area. Double tap and hold on an event to change its start and end times.
    You can scroll through different weeks by three-finger swipes left and right.
    The calendar gives good functionality, but takes time and experimentation to really master. I only learned about some included capabilities while preparing this section of the guide and consulting the user guide written by Apple as part of that process. That's something you'll find as you use iOS extensively. Unless you take the time to read the user guide, there's not always a lot to point you towards useful features. It really pays to take the time to do that and also explore within various apps you use.
How to Add Events:
To add an event, double tap the Add button. An entry screen will appear with a number of edit fields and options. You can get around it by flicking left and right. Double tap on an option to bring its controls out of hiding. For instance, in order to change the date, double tap on the "starts" item. This will then reveal the controls to set the time and date of the event's start. Double tap on an edit field like "title" to enter information about the event.
    It is possible to add a lot more than date and time information. You can add the location of an event. This interfaces with your contacts and also with Apple Maps to provide such things as an estimate of travel time. The "notes" field allows you to add information you'll need. You can also use it to paste in a link for an online event. At the time of the event, you will then find a "join" button you can double tap on, which launches you into the meeting. To add a recurring event, you need to double tap on the "repeat" item. This then presents several options. The basic ones like monthly and weekly are self-explanatory. However, if you have to create something more outside the ordinary, such as the second Monday of every month, that's entirely possible. Look in the "custom" choice in the repeat option. This is a perfect example of more complex options only revealing themselves as they're actively sought after. Use the "back" button after you've made choices to return to the main "new event" screen.
    Once you're satisfied with the contents of the new event screen, find the Add button at the top left of the screen, right below the New Event heading. Once you've entered sufficient information, this button will become active and no longer be dimmed as it was when you began creating your event. Once you double tap the Add button, the event will appear in your selected calendar.
    It's quite possible to have numerous calendars on your device at once. For the purposes of this guide, we'll assume that you don't do this and stick to the default calendar. Using other calendars, some options, such as having a second alarm for an event perhaps a day prior, may not be available.
    Nothing is carved in stone. It is quite possible to change an event. Double tap on it while in the "day view" where events are listed. You can also search for it and double tap on it in the search results. You can then edit it easily and remove it.
    To make several choices regarding default and additional calendars, which day marks the start of a week, etc, go into the Settings app. Go into the "apps" area and then into "calendar". While the default choices will be good for many users, work or other factors might require you to use additional accounts and change your default calendar. Perhaps, you need to use the Google or Outlook calendar as your default due to people you need to share your calendar with using Windows, Android, or other devices. When setting your default calendar, remember that the calendar first needs access to any accounts involved. For instance, you should first add your Google account before setting the Google calendar as your default calendar. When flicking through the options in the default calendar area, keep in mind that the overall location of calendars is displayed prior to options in that location. For instance, you'll find the word "iCloud" situated prior to the home, work and potentially other calendars present in your iCloud storage. The same will be true for Outlook, Google Exchange, and other sources of calendars which might be chosen.
The Reminders App:
Apple has drastically upgraded this app in iOS 13. It integrates with Siri and is capable of handling reminders for multistep tasks. This gives you the ability to create and deal with reminders. These can be repeating or once-only reminders. You can contain reminders in different lists, such as a list for work-related reminders and a separate list for home or personal reminders.
    I deeply appreciate the work that Apple has done upgrading this particular app. The old Reminders app couldn't handle project management. You could absolutely do a reminder to tell you to get the milk at the store. In fact, you could literally cause the reminder to trigger when you were at the store. You can do this in the new Reminders app as well. However, you couldn't do anything with more complex tasks. For instance, to complete the guide I'm writing, I need to complete each of its sections. I can create a master list of reminders, called "Complete the written guide". I set the completion date on that for a future date. In that list, I can then add tasks and subtasks. Completing each major guide section is a task. They can have completion dates, priorities, and other options. Meanwhile, completing each section requires several steps that can be added as subtasks. Both tasks and subtasks are themselves reminders and can have all the properties like due dates, locations where they're triggered, priorities, etc. This ability to categorize makes it possible to manage large-scale projects and quickly get a feel for what needs doing. I no longer require a third-party app to manage my larger creative projects. Before this Reminders app came out, I needed to find a third-party app to keep things organized.
Basic Layout:
There are no tabs to worry about in this app. Instead, Apple keeps everything on one main screen. Unless you're creating a reminder or working inside a list, that's where you'll be. At the top of the main screen are an Edit button and search field. After those items, you'll find a container of four buttons leading to the Today, Scheduled, All, and Flagged smart lists. Below this, the next heading down is My Lists. Any custom lists of reminders you've created will be found beneath this heading. Finally, at the bottom, you'll find a button for adding new lists.
Smart Lists:
These special lists are always present and are automatically populated with reminders based on the contents of reminder lists you create. For instance, the Today list will contain any reminders with the current date. The Scheduled list contains any reminders that have dates, allowing you to quickly get a grasp on upcoming reminders. The flagged list contains any reminders that you've flagged. The All list simply contains all the reminders you've created in one long list. The contents of the smart lists will update as you change or add more reminders to different lists. This naturally includes the default reminders list that you will automatically operate in unless you specifically go into another list.
Custom Reminder Lists:
Below the smart lists, you'll find a heading called My Lists. Beneath it, you'll find any lists you have created, plus the default reminders list. At the very bottom, you'll find a button letting you add a new list.
    If no list is specified when a reminder is created, it will be put in the default reminders list. That's what happens when you create a reminder using Siri. You can create different lists, like I have for the guide I'm writing. Before you can create a new reminder in the app, you need to actually be in a list. Once you're in one, the New Reminder button will appear after the last reminder in the list.
    You can do a lot to the reminders while inside a list. When you're on a reminder, you can double tap it to mark it complete. Alternatively, flicking up or down repeatedly will take you through several options. You can edit the name and details, add or remove a flag, drag a reminder elsewhere into another list, delete the reminder, and do other things. Also, if you have a lot of reminders in a list, you can set the rotor to three special settings including "completed", "uncompleted", and "overdue tasks". Flicking up and down will move quickly to the next or previous reminder in that state.
Creating Reminders:
There are a few ways to create reminders. Many third-party apps let you create them. You can ask Siri to create reminders for you. However, for the greatest level of control, it's good to use the Reminders app. Once you hit the New Reminder button, you can give the reminder a title or phrase like "throw out the garbage". Flick right from that edit field, and you'll see a wide range of options. You'll find that things are reasonably uncluttered and kept out of your way unless you actually need them. For instance, you don't always have to give reminders any date or time. They can merely be part of a checklist of things to do. You need to double tap the Remind Me on A Day button to cause the appropriate facilities to reveal themselves. You will then find options for selecting the date. The same goes for time. You can set a particular time in the same kind of way that you select a date. You can choose to flag the reminder, choose a priority, and also add subtasks. Remember that subtasks are, in fact, full reminders that are tied to a reminder. You can edit their details the same as you would any reminder. When you're finished making choices about the details, hit the Done button found near the top left. Remember that you can add locations, notes, a URL, and people to reminders. If you add a person to the reminder, you will be reminded when you are messaging the person. This is useful if you're always forgetting to talk about something with someone.
    You can add images to reminders and also add badges to lists. For instance, I could add a bookmark badge to the list for my guide or a house icon to a list of reminders about chores around home.
Integration with Siri:
Siri can learn from how you use the Reminders app and offer suggestions based on where you are and what you're doing. Siri can suggest making a reminder or suggest actions based on its understanding of the sentences in your reminders. There's a lot of integration possible now with other apps. For instance, a reminder of an upcoming restaurant meal with friends might be able to hook directly into the restaurant's app, allowing you to place an order or reserve a table. A reminder of an upcoming appointment might prompt a suggestion to order an Uber ride or provide other transit information to help you be at the proper location in time for the appointment.
The Journal App:
For centuries, people have been keeping private diaries or journals. Small wonder that a portable, secure device like an iPHONE or iPad would prove a capable aid to this practice. Not only can you write or dictate your thoughts, but it is also possible to add audio recordings, videos, and pictures to journal entries. It's strange that Apple took as long as it did to introduce a dedicated journal app. There are now many well established third-party alternatives in the app store which offer additional features. However, Apple has provided a simple and uncluttered free app which is more than likely to meet the needs of the average user. Below, we'll go over the basics of journaling and examine the Journal app in detail. For alternative apps which may offer different features, look in the App Store Expedition section for information about some popular and accessible alternatives.
    Basically, journaling is about writing down our thoughts privately in a habitual, systematic way. This can help us clarify and keep track of our thoughts and ideas. People also keep journals to document times in our lives. Unlike writing a blog, a journal is written initially, at least for your own private purposes. It's not meant for everyone to see. Certainly, not right away like a blog or article. Nothing at all prevents people from using apps like Bear, Notebooks or the Notes app included by Apple for this purpose. Many people take this very approach. Journaling apps must always be constructed with this basic reality in mind. They need to facilitate more mindful writing and provide tools to make it easier for people to get into the habit of journaling. For example, a commonly offered feature is daily prompts or questions. These might range from "what do you value the most among your possessions?" To "if you had to change your name, what would your new name be?". These are helpful, especially if you can't always think of something to write about. You don't have to start with a blank text field. If you're not used to thinking about life and writing thoughts down, it can be a lot less intimidating if a prompt or question is there for you to answer. Many journaling apps offer templates which you just need to fill out like a form. This can help avoid the terror of the empty text field and provide a routine for people who prefer this.
    The Journal app which Apple has produced and included in the iOs operating system offers a secure place to record your private thoughts, experiences, and reflections. It takes advantage of the secure information storage and machine learning capabilities of your iPhone. As you use your iPhone in everyday life, it learns about you. Typically, it uses this information for offering suggestions via Siri. The Journal app can tap into that collected information about where you've been, what music you've listened to, and who you've conversed with, among many other things your iPhone tracks in the background. It can then make various suggestions about what you might want to write journal entries about. These reminders can be scheduled to arrive at convenient times. There is also a more generic collection of writing prompts which can be shuffled and will presumably be added to over time.
    When you first run the app, you will be given some information on a screen which introduces the app. You can also take the opportunity to set your journal reminder schedule and notification settings. At the far right of such screens, you'll find a "continue" button, allowing you to proceed if you would rather not set other options immediately.
    The main screen of the Journal app is very simple. Near the top left is a "filter" button. Double tapping this will let you choose which entries should be displayed on the screen. By default, all entries will be shown. Each entry has a heading with the date of its creation. The entire entries will be shown in chronological order from the most recent descending into the past. Using the rotor, you can leave a bookmark at a particular entry. This may prove useful, especially as your journal becomes large. Flicking left or right will move to the previous or next entry. Right moves farther into the past.
    At the very bottom-right corner, you'll find a "compose" button. Double tap this to reach the entry composition screen.
    This screen has a number of choices on it. You can flick through and double tap the one you desire. The "new entry" choice will open up a blank text field for you to write in. There are also buttons to select from recent or recommended moments in your life to write about which your iPhone has taken note of. You may have gone somewhere or had a cherished song on repeat. There are also reflections. These are questions to answer by writing a journal entry. Double tap on the one you want to use. You can also flick up or down on these reflections to reach an option to shuffle them making different questions be displayed.
    Once you're in the entry text field, you can simply write down or dictate your thoughts. The rotor will have the usual text selection, misspelled words and edit options to help you perfect your entry. When you're finished, You'll find the "done" button near the top left. There are also "bookmark" and "more" buttons. The bookmark button will leave a bookmark at that entry. The "more" button lets you delete an entry, change the date, and may offer additional options in the future. Flicking past the text field, you'll find a series of buttons to get smart suggestions, add photos, use the camera, add audio, and add the location where you are to the entry.
    With these tools, it is easy to document events in your life and reflect on things. Everything is kept private and as secure as you wish.
    There are some settings for the Journal app found in the Settings app. These allow you to skip over the step where you're presented with suggestions and prompts before beginning to write. You can also choose whether you want to lock your journal so that you'll need to verify your identity with Touch or Face ID before gaining access to the app. You should also look in the Privacy settings area, where you'll find a "journal suggestions" category. There, you can determine which apps or aspects of life can be monitored and used by the Journal app to offer suggestions about what to write.
    While other third party journaling apps offer more features, Apple has given people a good basic set of tools to keep a journal on an iPhone. Occasionally, the iCloud system has suffered outages. However, I have yet to lose any information stored in iCloud. I certainly feel secure about my private thoughts being stored there.
Further Thoughts on Lifestyle Apps:
I hope the above information helps give you a sense of the many ways your iOS device can help you keep on top of everyday life. Thinking back to my days as a student at university and in secondary school, I don't have to dig too deeply to imagine how much better I might have been at managing my time. These days, thanks to my iPhone, I'm easily able to keep track of the various appointments, meetings, and tasks I need to attend to. I receive notifications of things like approaching deadlines automatically. For people needing to travel frequently, you'll find that Siri often takes this into account and provides estimates of travel time from your current location to where you next have to be. As Apple improves its artificial intelligence and that housed within your device, such suggestions will increase in their scope and usefulness. The more you make use of your device, the more it will learn how best to serve you.
    Apple has designed its apps to be useful to nearly everyone. Third-party app developers have built on the basic capabilities to create tools more suitable to specific cases like managing a work schedule or business. The advent of iOS 13 has opened up Siri and made it more able to interface with apps from other developers. The results can seem like magic. These capabilities will grow more powerful and better able to suit your preferences over time.
    You might expect that being reminded of things ahead of time would feel like being nagged about everything. Perhaps, you might worry that calendar and reminder apps powered by artificial intelligence might leave you feeling less in charge of your life and that your device knows more about it than you do. I haven't found this to be the case. Rather, it feels liberating, like having a trusted companion watching over you and saving you from the consequences of forgetfulness.
    If the clock, calculator, and calendar functions aren't quite meeting your needs, Look on AppleVis and the app store. There are plenty of accessible alternatives to be had. Advanced calculator alternatives are covered in the Getting Things Done section of this guide. There are also plenty of other accessible choices for task management, note-taking. 
    And calendar functions.

Reaching Out with Communication Apps:
Your iOS device can make communication with others on your own terms easy to do. This is especially true once you have mastered typing, dictation using Siri, and navigating apps using VoiceOver. No matter which iOS device you get, it can be used to communicate with others. There are a set of apps included in iOS especially for this purpose. In addition to these, there are more apps for various social media platforms, such as Mastodon and Facebook, which are available in the app store. Additionally, there are apps designed for conferences and online gatherings. You will find these third-party apps discussed in later sections of the guide. For now, we'll focus on apps included in iOS, which you'll find already installed on your device once you've completed the setup process. All of these apps tie into contact information and, usually, tie into Siri as well. This makes communicating as effortless as possible, even when you're just getting started. There's still a learning curve. Over time, you'll gain speed and proficiency as you practice and explore the apps we'll discuss here.
    Should you wish to contact friends, family, and others while you're still learning the ropes, Siri can help you accomplish most things. As it is integrated more with Apple Intelligence, things may improve rapidly between when this edition is published and when the next is ready. Just be aware that Siri doesn't actually understand what it's saying or doing. Everything is based on pattern recognition rather than an actual understanding of language. It may misinterpret your words and will definitely misunderstand some of what you say. Make certain the right words are in messages or emails you decide to have Siri send for you. Also, be careful with anything related to images created by artificial intelligence. I've never seen anything in my life. I very rarely make use of emoji. Be as certain as possible that any pictures or images you send to people are what you intend them to be. Apple Intelligence may not understand the effect you're trying to convey. Also, it's quite possible that life as a blind person hasn't given you the context to understand the more subtle aspects of images generated on your behalf by Apple Intelligence.
The Contacts App:
The Contacts app on the home screen is your first stop when it comes to getting your device ready to help you communicate. It has remained largely unchanged so far while iOS and iPadOS have developed. This is where you should put any contact information you have about people who you want to communicate with. iOS can then make use of that information via other apps. The more information you put in this repository, the better your iOS device will serve you as a communications aid. It is quite possible to add contacts to different groups, such as for personal and work. Personally, I just have them all in a single list within the app.
    Unless you change settings, contacts will be kept in alphabetical order. By using the VoiceOver rotor and turning it to headings, you can then flick up and down to the next or previous letters. This makes for a quick and efficient browsing experience. For more control over how contacts are displayed and organized, go into the Settings app and double tap on Contacts. You'll see settings for whether contacts are sorted by last name first or by first name. There are also settings regarding the use of short names or nicknames. For some languages, these settings won't apply, since names are always ordered the same way.
How to Add Contacts:
Beginners may find it a chore to enter contact information. Dictation can certainly help, but often, the virtual keyboard is simply the best way to do things. The rewards of this labour will quickly become apparent. There is an Add button near the top left of the screen. Double tapping this button takes you to a form that you fill in. There are edit fields for all sorts of information. You can also use the Insert buttons next to fields to add more things, like additional phone numbers or email addresses. It's very comprehensive. You can specify different ringtones for contacts if you desire. My parents have a different ringtone assigned, so I always know when it's them calling.
    Some apps such as Facebook will present you with opportunities to integrate your contacts. This adds information from companies like Google and Facebook where you may have contact lists into the library of contacts on your iOS device. This information will then populate your list in the Contacts app. Before this step is ever taken, you will always be asked to be certain you want this to happen. Generally speaking, iOS is cautious when it comes to your privacy. On that note, look in the Privacy settings, and you'll find a Contacts category. This lets you control which apps have access to your contacts. Further along, you'll find similar buttons for Facebook and Twitter. No decision you make is ever written in stone regarding contact integration.
Accessing and Editing Contact Information:
As your contact list grows, you may want to use the search field near the top left of the app to quickly narrow down the selections. Type any part of the contact name into the field, and you'll likely see it pop up. Flick right through the choices to arrive at the contact. Double tapping on a contact opens it, giving access to its information. You can then perform actions such as sending a message, initiating a FaceTime call, sending an email, etc. The Back button gets you out of that contact's information back to the general pool of contacts. Before doing that, though, notice the Edit button near the Back button. This lets you access and edit the information. You can also completely delete the contact.
    Once information is in the Contacts app, iOS will start using it to make the social part of life easier in many ways. If you have an iPhone, the first result of these efforts you're likely to notice is that you'll know who's calling. Phone calls will be identified by name. You will also be able to make use of that information from within apps like the Phone app, Mail, FaceTime, or Messages apps. Furthermore, Siri can use this information. This lets you order Siri to do things, which is a lot easier than swiping and typing, especially as you're mastering the basics of VoiceOver. You can teach Siri about relationships. For example, it knows that Sara is my wife and Dan is my brother. This lets me say things like "tell my wife I'll be late for dinner" and be understood. You can dictate text messages, emails, and Facebook posts without having to go into the respective apps first. A lot of work has gone into making Siri a good communications aid. The Contacts app is how you give your iOS device and Siri what they need to help you keep in contact with people who matter to you.
    Any time you need address information, chances are you'll find an option to get it from your contacts. For instance, I sent my mother a gift from the app store and quickly got her email address thanks to the information about her in the Contacts app. Contact information is also used by the Maps and other GPS apps. This lets you ask for directions to reach addresses stored in the Contacts app. This can include transit, walking, and driving directions via the Maps app, BlindSquare, or other apps that can take advantage of this pool of information.
    While there are options to call or message people inside the Contacts app, it is mainly useful as a repository. You'll mostly use it to search for and add new contacts. Other communication apps will typically let you access contact information directly from inside themselves. Even so, it's a good idea to take the time to explore the Contacts app thoroughly.
The Phone App:
People who have iPhones will be happy to know that the actual Phone app is very comprehensive and easy to use. It was originally one of the centrepieces of the iPhone. These days, it is all but forgotten by many users until they occasionally need to receive or make a phone call. The app is one of many examples of something done right and left largely unchanged throughout the many improvements made to iOS.
    Making, receiving, and managing calls are all easily achieved presuming you have mastered operating the touchscreen with VoiceOver. Siri is fully integrated with this app, so you can call anybody in your contacts by simply asking Siri to call the person's name. Indeed, it is perfectly possible to ask Siri to call a number that you recite. Just don't pause for too long, or it will presume you've finished and won't realize you're having trouble remembering the rest of the number. It is also possible to ask Siri to answer an incoming call or end a call in progress.
    While a call is in progress, it is possible to start and stop recording it. The button to record a cal can be found on the screen which appears during a call. 
    For blind users, I strongly suggest going into the Settings app and into the settings for "Phone". Find the "incoming calls" option and double tap this. Flick right and double tap the option for "full screen" rather than banner. This makes the app far easier to deal with as a blind user. For sighted people, a recent thought was to make phone calls less intrusive by having the control area take up less of the screen in case they were looking at an app or video. Finding the banner is possible, but difficult to do consistently for blind users trying to quickly respond to calls. It is far easier to use the classic full-screen interface and have the options take up the whole screen while we feel around for the one we want.
    There are five tabs across the bottom of this app. They are Favourites, Recent, Contacts, Keypad, and Voicemail. Double tapping on a tab takes you to that particular area, which will occupy the rest of the screen.
Dealing with Calls:
If a call comes in, a screen pops up with numerous options. If you simply want to answer it, just double tap with two fingers anywhere on the screen. This is also how you hang up. If you're wearing wired EarPods or other headsets, there should be a button you can press to answer or end a call. On the EarPods that may have come with your device, it's the long indented section that feels like it's been carved out of the remote in between the two round parts that can raise or lower volume. If you're wearing AirPods, double tap either one to answer or end a call.
    You can also do other things. At the top of the incoming call screen are Message and Remind buttons. These will make a reminder to return the call later or respond to the call with a message you can type in. Declining a call will pass the caller on to your voicemail, where he or she can leave a message. At the bottom left, and right corners are Decline and Accept buttons. You'll also find a button which lets you record a call in progress. A voice announces this out loud on the call, so everyone knows a recording is being made. Double tap the button you want to use. You can press the Sleep/Wake button twice quickly to decline a call. Pressing that button once will allow you to lock your screen, so you don't hit keypad buttons.
Favourites:
Having contacts added to your Favourites has a couple of implications. First of all, you can call them by going into the Favourites tab, flicking through the list of names, and simply double tapping on the one you want. Your iPhone will then make the call for you. Nice and speedy. Also, there are different rules regarding Favourites when it comes to Do not Disturb settings. You can have these set to always allow people on your Favourites list through when they call, even when in Do Not Disturb mode. I'm rather thankful for this as I would typically rather not miss a call from a family member, good friend, or my landlord.
Recents:
Any calls you have missed, made, or received are all shown in this tab. They are organized in chronological order, with the most recent call at the top. Flick right or scroll up with three fingers to quickly move through the list of calls. It is a handy way of easily returning calls, especially if the number hasn't yet been added to your contacts. Simply double tap on the number or name to return the call. Alternatively, flick down repeatedly with one finger, and you'll find options such as one for deleting the call, and a More Info button. Double tap this button to obtain any known information, plus find options to add the number to your contacts, thereby creating a new contact. There are other options similar to what you'll find in the Contacts app.
Contacts:
This tab is basically like the Contacts app. Double tapping on a contact name will move you into that contact's entry, where you'll find the usual options.
Keypad:
This tab gives you access to a virtual phone keypad. As you input a number, you'll even hear touchtone beeps as you would if using an actual telephone. This is good for blind people, as you'll know when you've successfully entered the right digits. If you need to delete a digit, you'll find the button you need near the top right of the screen. Just below the numeric keypad but above the row of tabs, you'll find a Call button in the middle. It's right above the Contacts tab. Double tap that button to make a call.
    During a call, the keypad is displayed so that you can make use of touchtone systems. There are occasions, however, when this is less than desirable, as it's possible to accidentally press keys with your cheek. There is a button that hides the keypad if you wish. You'll find options right below the keypad to end the call, mute, or hide that keypad. Once the keypad is out of the way, you'll find options to switch the call to speaker, among others such as muting the microphone. The options are always in the same position once you've reached the screen you want. This means that you can become used to flicking quickly left and right to go over options and double tapping the one you want. Alternatively, you can take the time to explore the screen and learn where the options are placed. Touch near the option you want and slide your finger until you find it. Then, lift your finger and double tap or keep your finger on the option and tap with another finger anywhere on the screen. The result will be that the option is implemented. Call a friend or family member if you need to look at the screens available during a phone call. Make certain you're speaking with someone who has the time to wait while you feel around the screen and perhaps try various things out. All the better if you know someone with an iPhone who can offer helpful information on where options are on the screen as he or she is seeing it.
Voicemail:
This last tab is a very nice addition, presuming your carrier supports it. Not all phone plans come with what is called "visual voicemail". Presuming you have it, this tab will be where you go to receive your messages, set your greeting, etc. Messages will be downloaded to your phone for you to easily review at your leisure. I've become quite attached to this feature and pay a small fee for a package of additional features that includes "visual voicemail" as part of my phone plan.
    If, for whatever reason, you don't wish to use this or can't get a plan that has it, you can still use the normal voicemail offered by pretty much all phone companies. You simply use the keypad discussed earlier to enter your passcode and operate the menus as you would with an ordinary touchtone phone. This may prove stressful for beginners, as they have yet to gain proficiency with finding and entering digits on their touchscreens. Visual voicemail eliminates this hassle and does away with any time pressure.
    To use visual voicemail, double tap the tab, and you'll find a greeting button near the top of the screen. This lets you record your voicemail greeting that people hear when you miss or decline their call. I don't recall needing to do any other things to set up visual voicemail. I got it some years ago and have kept it ever since. You may have to get help from your carrier. When you receive messages, they are put in a chronological list, with the most recent messages at the top. You can simply flick through them and double tap on a message to start it playing. Double tap on the More Info button next to a message if you want to get to the same contact page as you'd arrive at through the Contacts tab or the More Info button found in the Recents tab.
    You can pause a message during playback, move back or forward through it, and do other things like return the call, delete the message, etc. This makes it easy to manage messages, even if you have yet to deal with the rotor and flicking gestures. It makes for a very efficient, stress-free way of dealing with messages.
    Another sometimes incredibly handy thing about visual voicemail is that it produces a transcript of any messages you receive. These aren't always perfect. However, they can prove helpful at times to quickly see what a message is about.
    There are other options such as call waiting, ending a first call and receiving a call that has come in while you're on a first call, adding people to calls, etc. I suspect that carriers need to support these features. In appropriate circumstances, options will appear on the screen while you are in a call.
    It is also possible to be in a call while still using other apps. Simply press the Home button or make the equivalent home gesture if your device lacks a home button. This allows you to get out of the phone app. Your call will continue even as you do other things. There is a bar near the top left of the screen that you can double tap to return to the call screen if you like.
FaceTime:
Pandemic restrictions around the world kept family and friends physically apart from each other for unnaturally long periods of time. This has kicked efforts to bridge those separations via online social tools into high gear. Many companies were quick off the mark to capitalize on the desperate, sudden social need. Apple arrived late to this particular party. However, it has learned valuable lessons over these turbulent years. These lessons have gone into dramatic developments in their whole ecosystem of services to make sharing experiences possible which go well beyond conversations. The FaceTime app is the centrepiece of these efforts. The ability to have group video and audio conversations has been dramatically improved upon. Through FaceTime, people can now watch movies together in synch with each other, fully able to witness and discuss what they see and hear at the exact same time thanks to Apple keeping things in synchronicity. They can listen to the same album while conversing. If the shared experience is a comedy show, they would all laugh at jokes they heard and saw at the same time as other members of their group, no matter how far apart they might be. Those conversations take place in spatial audio, with people's voices coming from positions analogous to where they show up on everyone's screens. All of this has taken massive amounts of time and effort on Apple's part. However, the payoff will likely be immense given current circumstances. Who hasn't missed the ability to have a movie night with friends and family or talk while hearing the same music? In order to take full advantage, everyone will need to be subscribed to the appropriate Apple services in question. This is easily accomplished, especially for families who share a family subscription to these services.
    FaceTime is used to make audio or video calls to others who use iOS devices or computers supporting FaceTime. Now, this also includes people outside the Apple ecosystem who can join in FAceTime experiences through their web browsers. To use FaceTime, you need an Apple account for yourself. Presuming your device has been set up, you have already created your Apple account. You'll also need to know an email address or phone number of people who you want to contact via FaceTime. This information may be found in the Contacts app or added in directly from within the FaceTime app. Once done, that person will be found in the Contacts app.
How to Make a FaceTime Call:
You can do this in a few ways. From inside the FaceTime app, you can double tap on either the Audio, or Video buttons near the top of the screen. Next, double tap a contact's name. This will make a call to that person. You can also use Siri from anywhere on your iOS device to make a call. Simply invoke Siri and then say "FaceTime" or "FaceTime audio" followed by the person's name. This will initiate a call. Also, you can initiate a FaceTime call from within the Contacts app. Just go into the contact entry you're interested in, and flick right until you reach the FaceTime Call button. Double tap to initiate the call. Groups can be called as well. This can be done by adding and inviting people to a call in progress, or by creating a group. 
    There are options you can use during a FaceTime call. Video calls can make use of the front or rear-facing cameras built into your iOS device. You'll find buttons to choose which camera to use on the call screen. You can also end a call in progress, switch to an incoming or waiting call, or mute your microphone. Double tapping with two fingers will accept or end a call. You don't have to be in the FaceTime app to receive a FaceTime call. A two-finger double tap will accept the call from anywhere. Also, a menu pops up giving you options that you can flick over should you want to decline the call, for example.
    During a call, you can go into the control centre and set your microphone in a few ways. You can set it to wide spectrum to capture all the sound in your environment. For instance, you could be at a presentation or listening to a radio or TV program. You could set the microphone to wide spectrum and everyone in your FaceTime call would hear what you were hearing as well as anything you might say. Alternatively, there's a voice isolation mode, which makes it easier to hear your voice even in noisy environments. The default standard mode is also available for when you don't need either of these two extremes. During a FaceTime call, you'll find the mic mode button near the top right of the control centre once you've invoked it. Note that these mic modes require an iPhone or iPad with an A12 chip or later. This includes the iPhone XR and XS at the very bottom end. For iPads, any iPad created in 2018 or later should have the A12 chip or an even more modern one. These chips have the required artificial intelligence capabilities to perform the machine learning required for these mic modes, letting them respond quickly to environmental audio conditions.
    Near the top of the screen, you'll find an Edit button letting you delete FaceTime contacts. You'll find a Search field letting you look for contacts by name, email, or number. Past this, you'll find a button called "Create link". This lets you create a link which you can then send to people via email, message or social media. These people may use the link to join a FaceTime call with you. It works even when people use Android, Windows, or other devices because it makes use of their web browser to do so. As host of the call, you can reject unwanted participants and will have other options to manage the call.
    The "New FaceTime" button lets you manually add one or more contacts and then initiate a FaceTime call with them. These calls can be audio only or video calls which use the cameras and microphones in the devices used by participants. 
    Also, look in the Settings app, where you'll find specific settings for FaceTime. These let you determine whether people can contact you through FaceTime via your email address or phone number. There are settings to decide whether the tiles containing pictures of the current speaker become more prominent automatically. You can also choose whether to make use of the new Shareplay feature. This allows you to share audio or video being played on your device with fellow call participants. You will also find settings regarding notifications generated by FaceTime. You can decide how they are displayed and whether they are announced by Siri separately from what VoiceOver will announce. To specify whether FaceTime can use cellular data, look in the Cellular setting. Remember that FaceTime must use either Wi-Fi or cellular data. Also, video calls use more data than strictly audio ones.
    I have found FaceTime to be especially useful in a few ways of particular interest to blind people. I've used it to show distant relatives what my apartment was like, using the ability to switch to the rear-facing camera on the back of my iPhone. This has also been a useful way to have a sighted person help read things my OCR apps can't understand. They can help me look for lost items. You could theoretically use FaceTime to have someone sighted help you navigate somewhere, or at least see where you were to find you more easily.
The Messages App:
This is where any text, video, or audio messages are sent, received, and managed. You can send messages to groups or individuals. These are organized as "conversations". Messages are sent through Apple's service if they're to other Apple devices. These can be Mac computers or other iOS devices. You need to be connected to the Internet to use the Messages app. These go through Wi-Fi or cellular Internet connection and don't count against your texting plan. Otherwise, if they're to non-Apple phones, they are regular text messages and will use your texting plan. You can attach media from other apps, record audio or video messages, and decorate your text messages in all sorts of ways.
    True to form, Apple keeps things as free of complexity as possible. There are no tabs in this app. At the top, you'll find Edit, Compose and Search buttons. Between the Edit and Compose buttons is the app title, which is a heading. You can always turn your rotor to headings and get right back to the top easily. Flicking right past the Compose button, you come to a search field. This lets you look for contacts and conversations, which is useful as you get more of these. Past the search field, you start with the main area filled with the names of groups or people and previews of the most current messages of each conversation. It is organized with the most recent conversation first. This continues to expand as you communicate more. Double tap on a conversation to enter it.
How to Send a Message:
There are a few ways to send messages. The easiest is to simply use Siri. Say something like "tell Norman I'll be late for lunch". Siri will compose the message, ask if it understood you correctly, and then offer you a chance to cancel or change the message. Otherwise, you can just say "yes", and it'll send the message. You can also ask Siri to read messages to you. This would be especially useful for beginners still getting used to VoiceOver.
    Double tapping on the Compose button opens a screen letting you make full use of the app's capabilities. You can add one or more names from your contacts. Typing a partial name will cause likely candidates from your contacts to be listed. You can flick right to get to these and double tap the one you want to add. There are plenty of possibilities when it comes to creating your messages. You can type and edit your message in the edit field after double tapping on it. Flicking over the field when it's ready to receive input, you should hear VoiceOver say "is editing". You can type your message or find the Dictate button to the left of the spacebar on the virtual keyboard. Double tap and speak your message, finishing by double tapping again to stop. Messages can have more than one line, so use the Return button if you like. When finished, flick right to get to the Send button and double tap it. Recording an audio message is also simple. Double tap and hold with one finger on the Record Audio button. While doing this, speak your message and release your finger when you're done. You can then play what you've recorded to make certain it's correct before sending the message via the Send button.
Receiving Messages and Viewing Conversations:
When messages arrive, VoiceOver will read them to you, presuming you haven't changed any settings in Notifications to stop this from happening or have a focus turned on which prevents notifications from disturbing you. This makes it possible to carry out conversations without ever typing or swiping. All fine and good for current simple stuff. When you want to look back through a conversation, double tap on it and go into that conversation's screen. You can then flick right through the messages from oldest to most recent. At the end of the messages, you'll find tools to compose your next reply in that conversation. This will always be at the bottom right. You can also see if messages have been delivered and whether any additional content has been added such as "stickers", "files", etc. Near the top left, by the contact name, you'll find a More Info button. This shows you anything you've entered about the contact and gives you a series of options such as making a FaceTime call, sending an email, etc.
Participating in Group Conversations:
Once you've added more than one contact to a message you've composed, you will start a group conversation when you send that message. You can also receive a message that involves you in a group conversation when you reply to it. You can name groups once they're created. To accomplish this, go into the group conversation, and use the More Info button. Flick right from the top left, and you'll find a "name" field. This is where you can enter a group name. The More Info screen also has other options, letting you add new group members or leave a group conversation you no longer wish to participate in.
Concerning Emojis:
VoiceOver will describe any emojis other people use in their messages to you. If you want to use them yourself, while you're in an edit field, find the spacebar at the bottom of the keyboard and flick left past the dictate button. You'll find a Next Keyboard button. One such keyboard is full of these emoji images. Once you've switched to that keyboard, you can find whatever emoji you want and double tap it. Use the Next Keyboard button to cycle through any keyboards you've added and get back to your normal preferred keyboard. Descriptions for emojis are generally well-thought-out and brief, so this is perhaps the easiest way to clarify your meaning through imagery for sighted people. It also doesn't cost anything.
Settings Associated with the Messages App:
Go into the Settings app and double tap on Messages. These settings let you control many aspects of how the Messages app behaves. For instance, you can choose whether subject fields are shown. You can also turn on a setting that sends images in low quality to save data. You'll also find a Blocked button, which lets you manage blocked contacts you want to avoid hearing from. There's another setting letting you select not to be notified when people not on your contacts list send you messages. They are kept in a separate list for you to review at your convenience. There are many more settings. Also, remember that settings in other areas like Privacy can influence how the Messages app functions. It's one of those central apps that ties into a lot in iOS.
More to the Messages App:
Apple has built considerably more capabilities into their Messages app. The Digital Touch aspects will allow people to add drawings, backgrounds, and other things to their messages. That was what I used accidentally to send my good friend an angry fireball. I haven't had any success using this effectively with VoiceOver. The sketching and drawing aspects seem to be the real core of Digital Touch. If you receive messages with drawing or Digital Touch elements, you'll be told the elements are there, but not what they are.
    There are a set of "effects" you can attach to your messages. They can either be contained in bubbles or else occupy the whole screen along with your messages. To use these, write your message first. Next, double tap and hold on the Send button or press firmly on it if you have 3D Touch enabled. This adds a panel to your message screen containing choices. There are a more limited number of choices for bubble effects. These include slam, gentle, loud, and invisible ink. It may be possible to add more choices here. Screen effects include lasers, balloons, confetti, and many more. It will default to one effect, but if you flick right past this, you'll come to a page slider that changes the effect to be sent. After choosing the desired effect, find the Send button and double tap it. If you get a message with an effect, you may hear appropriate sounds as the message is read. The effects have descriptions that VoiceOver will read out in addition to your message.
    One of the easier elements to make use of for blind people are "stickers". Think of these like stamps. Using them is just as simple as sticking a stamp onto paper. Next to the Digital Touch button, you'll find a Messaging Apps button. Double tap on this and more options will appear on the touchscreen. If you're already in a message, you need to flick left to find a Show More button and double tap that. Then you can access the Messaging Apps button. This gives you access to a lot. Once you enter this area, a slider moves you between pages of options. You start on a "recents" page, but if you've never used Messaging Apps and stickers before, nothing will be on it. Go to the next page, and you can look through options. Near the bottom of the screen, there are buttons for browsing apps and stickers. You default to the stickers section, which will contain any stickers you've acquired. Some apps come with stickers. For instance, the Weather Gods app is popular among blind people, and it has a number of well-described weather stickers. There are also stickers you can purchase depicting favourite movie characters, locations, and much more. Flick right through the stickers you have and double tap the one you want to add. It's possible to add more than one sticker, but I don't think you can position them manually.
    Stickers are designed for decoration, whereas emojis are images carefully chosen and constructed to make the emotional context of messages clear. Think of stickers like stamps and emojis like psychological punctuation marks. There are a far more limited number of emoji symbols. They are all included in the Emoji virtual keyboard included as part of iOS. Emojis are free and available for use in any app capable of accepting typing. You won't find a Luke Skywalker emoji, since Star Wars images are trademarked and don't clearly convey emotional meaning to people unfamiliar with that fictional universe. One emoji is a slice of pizza. While this is a food of western civilization, you can easily tell that it's food and conclude that the message sender may be expressing he or she is hungry. You can realize this even if you've never encountered pizza before. Emojis can certainly be use decoratively, and often are, but that isn't their primary purpose like it is with stickers.
The Messages App Store and Integrated Apps:
These apps plus others you already have are capable of enhancing your messages or making use of the Messages app to let you do things. Once you acquire an app with this kind of capability, it will be put in your "app drawer". This is also where you'll find your stickers. You can manage the contents of this app drawer. Find the Manage button, and you can hide what you don't find useful, removing it from the drawer. You can also reorder the contents of the drawer. The first time you visit the Messages app store, you can choose to automatically add apps that integrate with messages into the drawer. I recommend doing this. Presuming the app in question is accessible, the part that integrates with the Messages app should also be.
    One good example is the Music app that comes with iOS. After finding it in my app drawer, I was able to send a message to my wife Sara and add a clip of the song I was listening to. She could hear that music as she read the message. I only had a short poke around, but it looks like I could have also sent clips of recently heard songs and not just the one I happened to be hearing as I wrote the message. The Dropbox app lets you send links to files you have uploaded to that service, sharing them via messages. There are many other apps. Many of them are free. I urge people to experiment with people who know you as you try these apps out. Before spending any money, look on www.applevis.com. The forums and app recommendations will be helpful in avoiding spending money on more visual apps or on stickers that haven't been labelled accessibly. Exploration of screens is key. Take time to flick and feel around to get a sense of what's possible with messages apps in the drawer. VoiceOver doesn't read out all your choices, but encourages you to explore and find out where they are on the touchscreen.
The Mail App:
Apple has created a good, simple app for dealing with email that is completely accessible. It can organize your mail by thread, which can really help if you get a lot of email. You can also make use of different mailboxes to make certain you get to all your important mail. As with all of Apple's included apps, it covers the basics well and steers clear of too much complexity. It pays to have the rotor gestures mastered, as they are helpful in reading and editing messages.
How to Set Up the Mail App:
Go into the Settings app and flick right to get to the Mail settings. Double tap on that, and you'll be where all the setup and preference options are. You can then enter the needed information if it isn't there already. Presuming you've created an Apple account, you'll have already given it an email account or have had one created for you by Apple. You may need information such as your Smtp server, password, etc. if you want to use an email account from another email service like Gmail.
    There are settings for deciding how messages are organized. You can have them grouped into threads or simply placed in your mailboxes in chronological order. You can also choose how many lines are shown as a preview of messages. Likewise, you can also decide whether you want summaries of messages and threads to be shown, provided your device supports Apple Intelligence. Furthermore, you can also decide if you want Apple Intelligence to learn from how you use the Mail app so that it can offer helpful suggestions. Additionally, you can decide whether you wish to be warned before deleting messages. There are options in the account area to decide how frequently new mail is checked for and pushed to your iOS device. Each different email account you use in this app has its own settings, such as whether you want a sound to alert you to the presence of new emails arriving. There are also composition settings, including the ability to create an email signature that is automatically included below every message you send.
Layout of the Mail App:
This is another case where Apple didn't separate everything into tabs. Everything is on one main screen, with various options like composing email taking you to a separate screen that is focussed on a given task. At the top, you'll find the mailbox selection. You default to the inbox, but double tapping the mailbox back button takes you out of that and into the mailbox list. Presuming you're in the right box, flick right, and you'll find a Select button. This lets you select one or more messages in the currently selected mailbox by double tapping on them. You can then perform operations on all selected messages at once. For instance, you can move, delete, or mark messages as read or unread among other options.
    To the right of the Select button is a button called More. This is new to iOS 18 and is used to choose how you want your messages organized. You can now concentrate on categories of messages which Apple automatically sorts your mail into. Alternatively, you can select the "List" option to show all emails in a list regardless of categories. You can also decide whether to have priority emails shown at the top, as determined by artificial intelligence. Categories include primary transactions, promotions, and updates.
    To the right of the More button is the search field. This lets you search for specific messages. There is also a dictate button which lets you speak your search term rather than typing it in the search field.
    Next comes the main area where messages are listed. You can flick through messages or threads if you decide to deal with messages thread by thread. Double tap to fully go into a message. There's no limit to the size of your message list.
How to Browse Messages:
Turn your rotor to the messages setting, and you'll be able to quickly navigate through messages in threads by flicking up or down. This lets you get a handle on discussions easier, letting you quickly skip over to the next or prior message within a thread.
    If the rotor is turned to other settings, such as actions or edit, you'll find other options when you flick up and down. This is how you access such things as options to delete messages or move them among other things.
Composing Emails:
The bottom-right corner always contains the Compose button. Double tap this to get to the message composition screen. There are various fields. Getting around the screen is pretty simple. Double tap to go into a field. You default in the "to" field, where you can enter a full or partial name or email address. Flick right after typing some of a contact's name or email, and you'll be presented with any options that might be who you're trying to contact. Double tap on the ones you want to add to the email, and their names will be added. Flick to the right past any such options to get to other fields like CC, BCC, subject, and finally, the message body. Remember that rather than flicking, you can feel around the screen to find out where fields are and double tap on them to enter them. When done composing, feel around the top left of the screen, and you'll likely find yourself on the Back button. Flick right, and you'll come to the New Message heading. To the right of that is the Send button. Double tap that to send your message.
Filtering Messages:
Filters are different from the categories introduced above. Touch the bottom-right corner to find the Compose button. Flick once to the left of this, and you'll come to the Filters button. This lets you filter messages so that only messages you're particularly wanting to focus on are shown. For instance, I have my filter set to "unread messages" so that I'm not bothered by ones I've already read. There are many more possible filters, so take the time to look around the options after double tapping the Filters button. Another useful one I've had occasion to be thankful for is one which lets you view only emails which have arrived during the current day. With the new categories, all of this ability to slice up your inbox can be very liberating.
    To get back out of areas, simply check the top-left corner of the screen for a Back button. You'll never be trapped anywhere. There should always be a Back button. Also, one of the drawbacks of the Mail app is that there doesn't seem to be any way to simply delete all mail in your inbox. You have to actively delete or archive messages individually. This is by far my biggest gripe with the app. Once you're done with a message and have archived or deleted it, you are automatically taken into the next messages. For more of an overview to pick what to tackle next, double tap the Back button to return to the mailbox you're working with.
The Apple Invites App:
To help people create invitations to events and manage responses, Apple created the Invites app which is included in iOS 18 or later. This app integrates with various services and makes use of Apple Intelligence to help generate descriptions and backgrounds. While anybody can receive and respond to invitations to events, only iCloud Plus subscribers can send invitations.
    As part of an invitation, it's possible to use other Apple services. You can create a shared photo album which is available to all event participants. You can also add a shared playlist which people who are invited can add songs to if they subscribe to Apple Music Plus.
    This works well for people who are all participating in the Apple ecosystem. However, for groups where people use the Google, Android, and other ecosystem, you may want to consider investing in a third-party app like Fantastical which can help coordinate events.
Conclusion:
As with many areas of iOS, the Contacts, FaceTime, and Messages app form the central pillars of Apple's suite of communications options. Especially now, with the abilities to share content and experience it at the same time as others, Apple aims to give people the tools they need to keep in contact. I think it very likely that we'll see more connections made with services and apps in future iOS updates. No app is really an island on its own. Communication apps can be leveraged by other apps in Apple's ecosystem for maximum gain. Extensive efforts have been made throughout this web of apps to make everything as accessible as possible to people with disabilities.
    One piece of parting advice I'll give is to take the time to go into the Settings app and explore the settings for each of the apps discussed in this section. You should also read the portions of Apple's user guide which cover these apps. I don't tend to use all the capabilities offered. This is particularly true of more visual communication options like graphics, emojis, etc. There may very well be developments which I haven't discovered. Also, there will likely be changes with future iOS updates.
    I hope this helps get people started using their iOS devices to communicate with others. It's one of the primary ways these portable and powerful flat objects have changed many lives for the better, including my own. Whether I'm stuck in an elevator, in a car, or walking around the manmade lake near my building, I can be in touch with whomever I might need to. Should I drop something onto a patch of carpet where I couldn't hear it land, I could use FaceTime to contact a sighted friend or family member to literally look around for the object without leaving his or her home. There are just so many implications.
    The apps I focus on in this section mainly connect with people who are in your more immediate social circles. You might work with these people or be friends with them. Most likely, you are sometimes with them in everyday life. Hopefully, these apps and others included with iOS on your device will help keep your relationships solid and on track.
    When you bring in apps made by others and offered in the app store, the possibilities grow vast, indeed. There are special apps made to help deaf-blind people communicate more easily with others. There are apps like Google Translate that can render words spoken or written in another language understandable in mere fractions of a second. Combine these sorts of capabilities with the stupendous amount of information available from the Internet, and the implications for collaborative creativity seem endless. Once you've mastered the mechanics of VoiceOver and using a touchscreen, there are no other barriers to expressing yourself well.

The News App and Other Reference Tools:
Even before you venture out onto the app store or subscribe to any services, your iOS device is a gateway to a truly tremendous amount of knowledge available online. The Safari web browser lets you access any website you may want to. We'll be taking a tour of its capabilities in another section dedicated to browsing the web. There is also your digital assistant Siri that, like the Safari web browser, has its own dedicated section in the guide. Its most popular use is to answer peoples' questions, but it can also obey some commands. As revealed in the section about settings, Apple makes UK and US concise dictionaries and thesauruses freely available to be used anywhere that words are encountered in iOS. And then, there is the Apple News app. This gives you free access to a large collection of curated current news articles covering a vast array of topics. For a subscription fee, it will also provide you with access to content from a selection of newspapers plus over three hundred popular magazines. The vast majority of this is fully accessible to blind people thanks to the VoiceOver screen reader.
    Once you've mastered the app store, things get even better. You will find many apps from news organizations freely available and most often completely accessible using VoiceOver. Also, there are reference apps specially designed for iOS devices. Many of these are fully accessible and easy to use. They include everything from encyclopedias, to top quality dictionaries and thesauruses, to country information references like the World Fact-book app. Even more specialized reference apps such as those used to identify birds, plants, and medical conditions are available. There are handy medical reference apps such as the Be Ready app from the Red Cross that contains instructions to cope with emergencies. And that's not even counting the books you can obtain through the Books app or from many other vendors once you've mastered the app store and web browser.
    As with many sections in this guide, it would be utterly impossible to go through all the apps known to be useable with VoiceOver and explain their workings. Instead, I will cover a few apps that can serve as examples of what is available. These can all be acquired from the app store, often at no cost. We'll go over examples of such apps in this section. You'll end up with a good starting set of reference tools.
    Please don't ever stop seeking better alternative apps for your specific needs. They may well have escaped my notice or may be outside the scope of my personal interests. More apps are always being developed. Keep an ear on developments at AppleVis and watch for new apps that gain popularity in the app store. For now, let's begin with the dictionary and thesaurus options Apple makes freely available to all users of iOS devices.
Meaning and Vocabulary on Tap:
In the general section of Settings, you'll find a button called Dictionary. There, you can choose which dictionaries are used when looking up words. You can select or deselect resources by double tapping their titles. Being Canadian, my spelling tends to fall somewhere between American and British, but leans heavily towards British. As a result, I have all four English resources selected, plus the Apple dictionary. There aren't any real instructions about these tools in the user guides written by Apple. The basic idea is that anywhere you read or write text, you simply need to highlight the word you want to know about with the text selection rotor options. Next, use the "look up" option that appears in the edit rotor options. A sheet will be created instantly which contains definitions and other information depending on what resources you've selected as well as what Siri finds. This will pull you out of the app you were in, but once you're finished reading the information, you simply use the "close" button found at the top left, and you are placed back in the app. Apple makes Oxford British and American dictionaries and thesauruses available offline at no cost to the user. They simply reside on your iOS device and are there even when you have no Internet connection.
    For blind users, using these resources is just a bit more laborious. If you're writing, type the word in and then turn the rotor to the Edit setting. Flick down to select and double tap this. Now, the word is highlighted or "selected" as VoiceOver terms it. A popup menu will appear, and if you learn precisely where on the screen this occurs, you can double tap the "look up" option. However, this isn't necessary. The rotor is still set to edit, so just flick down until you reach the "look up" option and double tap this. A temporary window pops open, complete with all available information about the word you selected. If you want to look a word up while reading, simply turn the rotor to Words and find the word you wish to know about. Next, turn the rotor to Text Selection and set the selection amount to "word". Flick right to select the word and then turn the rotor to edit and flick down to "look up". Double tap this, and we're in that temporary window.
    This window shows the concise results from each resource. It is divided into headings for Dictionary and Siri Knowledge. More headings appear when the requisite information is available. For instance, there may be results found in the app store or Twitter. Presuming you're connected to the Internet via cellular data or Wi-Fi, Siri looks in many places on the web for information. If the concise results are enough, just double tap the "Close" button at the top left when you want to return to the app you were in. However, if you need more from a resource, each result in the concise window is actually a button. Double tapping on it will take you to the full entry, which may include further clarification or more alternative synonyms, etc. To get back to the root page, use the Back button in the top-left corner. When you're done looking at information and want to go back to the app you were in, use the Done button near the top left. The Done button is always available, even while inside full entries. There's no need to return to the root window before closing it.
The Apple News App:
Keeping up with current events is an activity very well suited to an iOS device. Their screens easily display articles, pictures, and videos, allowing people to navigate and interact with the presented content. Apple designed their News app to provide an easy way for people in their ecosystem to access articles and reports from trustworthy providers. The content on offer is curated by an editorial team at Apple, as well as by artificial intelligence. Publications make their material available in exchange for revenue from Apple subscribers and a special advertising service run by Apple. In theory, this presents you, their customer, with reliable news tailored to your specific interests at the lowest possible cost while still making things attractive for top magazines and news outlets. Your privacy is a major concern for Apple, so all information about what you read and about your interests is carefully anonymized before being made available to Apple and trusted partners. Data sent to The free service is very extensive and gives you access to a stupendous number of curated articles culled from the Internet and various popular publications deemed trustworthy by Apple. This service is partially supported by advertising which appears within articles. However, the experience is a lot less cluttered up and more standardized than it often can be on websites. This can be particularly advantageous for blind people. Also, what you read doesn't follow you in the form of targeted advertising elsewhere on the Internet. The idea is that Apple can make use of artificial intelligence to help deliver reliable news tuned to your interests without ever having to keep data on what you enjoy reading. All data pertaining to your specific choices and interests is kept on your iOS device. The artificial intelligence used to fine-tune the articles presented to you to match your interests is on your device rather than on a Cloud server. Publishers receive revenue based on the length of time spent reading their articles, plus income from revenue generated by Apple subscribers.
    You might wonder how Apple could possibly make a profit running a service like this. The answer is that they offer a service called News+ (News Plus). In addition to the free articles, people can subscribe to News+ and get access to a catalogue of over three hundred magazines. The exact number will depend on where you live. More will doubtless be added as time goes on. The cost per month is $9.99 US, which is around $13 Canadian at the time of this writing in March 2019. Update: After the first edition of this guide was published, Apple introduced the Apple1 subscription bundles. Many of the bundles include the News Plus service. For people who don't want to subscribe to any of the bundles of Apple services, you can still subscribe to individual ones which interest you separately.
    Designed by Apple, the app supports all the accessibility tools built into iOS. This makes articles, videos, and magazines very accessible to users of VoiceOver. Beginners can get around by flicking left and right and double tapping on options. In fact, this app is a splendid place for beginners to practice using VoiceOver's various reading controls. It will encourage you to master the VoiceOver rotor, which lets you move much more efficiently to headings, images, and links. Articles are a breeze to read. They can be read continuously or moved through line by line with VoiceOver's standard reading gestures. Once you have explored the screen and developed a sense of where things are, this app makes a tremendous amount of content very accessible. Video content plays easily, with the controls fully accessible to VoiceOver.
    Magazines are a bit more hit-and-miss when it comes to being accessible using VoiceOver. As a general rule, it's very rare that you won't be able to read the text, although this is the case with a few very visual magazines. The level of accessibility is heavily dependent on choices publishers make. I found a few that were nearly useless. However, the vast majority of magazines are done in a way that makes their article text very accessible. Most publications also make use of headings, sections, and captions, making them a pleasure to navigate and read once you've mastered the VoiceOver rotor. Other ones are simple PDF copies of the magazine issues. Publishers have a great deal of latitude. Typically, I've found that the more reputable publications will put in the effort to fully adopt and optimize the formatting capabilities of Apple News.
    If you run into pictures, these will often have captions describing them. Also, you will likely hear descriptions of them if you have VoiceOver recognition turned on and have enabled the image descriptions part of this set of options. I recommend you have screen recognition disabled while using the News app. Until Apple can teach this feature how not to undo the accessibility which is already present throughout this and other apps, the screen recognition feature typically does more harm than good.
    This app has different layouts for the iPhone and iPad. However, any content may be viewed on either device. For iPhone users, there are four tabs at the bottom of the screen. These are the "Today" tab in the far-left corner, the "News+" tab to the right, the "sports" tab next to the right, and the "Following" tab in the bottom-right corner. There used to be a "search" tab, but this has been combined with the "following" tab to make room for the "sports" tab.
The Today Tab:
Think of the material in this tab as a kind of summary of current news. Perusing the contents of this tab is like having an assistant go through news sources and highlight the most critical or interesting news for your consumption. In this very busy tab, you'll find a series of sections divided by headings. The Top Stories section comes first. There are also headings for any general categories you've expressed an interest in, like health, technology, business, etc. Also, there are sections more tailored to your interests, drawing on content from the Following and News+ materials. The Today tab puts all the most current content right in front of you.
    This can be navigated by flicking left or right through all the contents. Double tap on a topic or article title which interests you. Once you're in and article or topic, there will be a "back" button at the top left which will bring you back out a level. While this allows even inexperienced users to make use of the app, familiarity with the VoiceOver rotor will make a massive difference, turning the app into an enjoyable practical reference. Simply double tap on any article or other link which interests you. In addition to many "more stories about" links, you'll find some titles which are for newspapers such as The Globe and Mail. Double tap on such links to reach the current material from the newspaper or magazine they point to. You'll also find some "more actions" buttons. These give you options regarding the specific channel or topic of interest. For instance, in the "Today" tab, I could use the "more actions" button and then choose the option to block the trending stories channel from displaying content if I wanted.
The News+ Tab:
For people wanting deeper and longer articles about matters of interest to them, this is where you'll find such material in abundance, provided you've subscribed to the News Plus service. The heading at the top of the screen is "library". It's important to keep in mind that you can't really keep anything in this section permanently. Downloaded magazines will eventually be automatically removed from your device after a month or two. This tab lets you access complete issues of the newspapers and magazines made available to subscribers. These can be read online or downloaded for offline reading.
    Near the top of the tab, you'll find buttons called "my magazines", "Downloaded", "Newspapers", "Catalogue" and "Sort by". These buttons are directly beneath the "Library" heading at the very top of the tab. The "My Magazines" and "Downloaded" buttons let you look at magazines you've decided to follow. There may be more than just the latest issue of a magazine available to you. In some cases, only the latest issue is made available. This is always the case when it comes to the newspapers whose contents you can access. Rather than issues of newspapers, you are given access to channels of articles from a given publication, with the most recent articles presented first. You can't really search for a particular magazine with a search field. Think of this more like a newsstand, where you browse through the content based on your interests.
    The heart of this library is the catalogue of magazines. Double tap the "Catalogue" button, and we'll explore what's here. The "sort by" button is present along with the previously mentioned buttons. By default, the "sort by" button is set to show featured content first. However, if you prefer, you can double tap it and then select the "name" option to have the catalogue sort by the title.
    Past the "sort by" button, you'll find a "showing" button. By default, it is set to "featured" which means that a diverse selection of magazines are shown in the tab. Double tap on that button, and you have several choices. One of them is "all titles" meaning that the entire catalogue can be scrolled through at once. This can be splendid if you're just starting out and want to go through all the magazines to find ones of interest to you. However, the other choices offered by the "showing" button will let you display magazines which fit into many categories, including entertainment, science, and many more. Presuming you have double tapped on a selection, you'll find the list of material which fits your choice immediately after the "showing" button. This takes up the rest of the screen. In some cases, it won't fit on one screen. This is particularly true if you choose "all titles". In such circumstances, you'll simply continue scrolling through the entries as you flick right to read the next one. Alternatively, you can jump up or down using the three finger downward swipe to go up or upward swipe to go down. There is also the vertical bar on the right side of the tab.
    When you find a publication title of interest to you, double tap on it. Let's take Canadian Geographic as an example. This presents us with the most recent issues of the magazine, as well as a constantly updating channel of content from Canadian Geographic. Channels are produced by various publications and feature multiple feeds of content broken up into categories of interest covered by the publication. Once you go into a channel or magazine, you'll always find a "back" button at the top left, making it possible to return to the catalogue or go up one level of specificity. The publication or channel title will be next. A flick to the right gets you to the "more actions" button. Double tap this to choose options letting you share a channel, copy the link to it on the web, follow or unfollow a channel, or block all content from the channel. Following a channel indicates your interest in it. Articles from that publication will be presented more frequently in other tabs, like the "Today" tab. Channels you block won't show up in these tabs or in your searches. However, if you simply aren't following a channel, you may still sometimes see results from it since you haven't indicated a distaste for it.
    Flicking right past the "more actions" button, you'll find a selection slider. In this case, it will be set to "issues". You can flick right to find several recent issues of Canadian Geographic available for your reading. If you flick up or down on that slider, you'll find other topics. There's a "main" one which includes a selection of popular content. Flicking right past the recent issues, you'll come to articles which pertain to the topic you selected using the slider. Perhaps, you selected wildlife, science, or technology. The articles found by flicking right will be about that topic and will be presented from most current to older the farther you keep flicking to the right.
    This covers the basics of the News Plus tab. Using VoiceOver, you can navigate, access and follow magazines. That's mainly what you'll be doing in this tab. It's all about discovering magazines which you are personally interested in or might need as references. You can enter a magazine or publication channel right from this tab. We'll be diving more deeply into reading magazines and managing channels later.
The Following Tab:
This tab is where you can get beneath the larger publications and follow topics of interest. You can also block content sources you don't want included in material presented to you in the app. This tab is also where you can take control of what the app notifies you about via notifications as well as through email. Think of this tab as a combination of control centre and topical content space. This is the best place where you can customize your experience and help the artificial intelligence on your device learn what interests you.
    This tab has been drastically updated since the first edition of the guide. Things are a lot less cluttered now. Near the top, you'll find an edit button. This lets you arrange the contents of the tab to your liking. Sadly, it's more tricky than in other such edit screens to actually move channels or topics around. You need to double tap and hold on the reorder button to the right of the title you wish to move. You then drag up or down with the finger already on the screen in order to move the entry. Release your finger when it's in the right place or when you have to double tap and hold again, so there's more room to move farther up or down. You'll also find buttons called "shared with you", "Saved stories", and "History". These each lead to self-explanatory sections where you can choose from those special selections of shared, downloaded or previously viewed content. Past those, you'll find two sections which can be expanded or collapsed. The first of these is called "channels and topics". The other one is called "manage".
    The "channels and topics" drawer opens to reveal a list of every channel or topic of interest which you have decided to follow. Remember that topics might be searches for keywords which are performed when you refresh the app or at times when the app checks automatically for content. As an example of a topic, I typed in the name of my city, Mississauga, into the search field in the "Search" tab. I flicked right through the results until I found Mississauga, Ontario. I double tapped on that to enter the "topic". Flicking right several times showed me many articles from various publications which all had to do with Mississauga. While there is a "follow" button to the right of the title of the topic, VoiceOver currently doesn't indicate whether the button is selected and thus the topic is followed. Thankfully, there's the trusty "more actions" button. Double tapping on that, I could flick right through the options and discover one which changes from "follow" to "unfollow" depending on whether you're following a topic or channel. I could double tap on that "Follow" option to add it to the collection of topics and channels which I follow. Now, the artificial intelligence on my iPhone will actively check for stories about Mississauga.
    You can look at the contents of channels right from the "Following" tab, or even from the "Search" tab. The app is very flexible that way. You could use this to preview channels or topic ideas to get a sense of what they will include before following them, which adds them to the collection of things the News app actively searches for. Double tap on any topic or channel, as discussed previously in this section.
Search:
This tab is for when you know the keywords or phrase you want to find information about. Perhaps, you don't know or care which publications that information comes from. The search field in this tab is where you type those words in. Double tap the search button and then flick through the results just like any other search. Double tap on a result that interests you and check it out. If it's a topic or channel which has been found, you can follow it. The type of result found will be stated along with the content, so you can decide whether to investigate by double tapping on it or move on to the next result with a right flick. It's pretty much that simple.
Reading Content:
Now that you have an idea of what the different tabs and areas in the News app are for, we'll focus more keenly on the experience of reading articles and magazine content. Once you've double tapped on an article, the article becomes the main content of the screen. You'll find its title as a heading, as well as buttons to adjust the text size and share the article. There's always a Back button in the top-left corner to leave the article and go back to the Today tab. Different publishers of these articles do things a little differently. Don't expect things to be consistent regarding article structure. Some will be more divided by headings than others. You may find more or less divisions by heading within different articles. In some cases, it might be better to move between images. Turn the VoiceOver rotor to whichever option works best. Perhaps, you'll find the "containers" rotor option to be a useful way to navigate. I've always thought that this app would be a prime case for Apple to use containers to break up information more neatly. However, this doesn't seem to have been done yet systematically.
    Any content I might choose to serve as an example will be long gone by the time this guide gets into your hands. Let's take an article from CBC News about the carbon tax going into effect. Near the title, you'll find the word "Politics" indicating the section the article was taken from. Next, you'll find the article title as a heading. There are then several headings you can quickly use the rotor to flick up or down between. Alternatively, You could flick downward with two fingers to continuously read the article. Occasionally, this doesn't entirely work, and you'll find that VoiceOver jumps back to the beginning. Normally though, the whole thing is available, so there will be no need to scroll to the next page. That happens automatically as VoiceOver reads. Great for when you're having a coffee and just want to take it all in.
    There are times when a more active closer reading of an article is what's needed. That works very well. You can use the rotor to flick up or down to specific headings within the article to get to what you are interested in. Once there, you can flick left or right to read line by line. You can use the rotor to go by character or word, so you can, for instance, find out how someone's name is spelled. Also, the text selection part of the rotor lets you select one or more words, lines, etc. This lets you then set the rotor to edit and copy parts of an article. Furthermore, you can select a word and look it up using the Edit rotor setting. This taps into the dictionary and thesaurus you've selected in iOS settings, and also grabs definitions from the web if you're online. I've found that when I select a word, the "look up" option pops up, and I can just double tap my iPhone to look up the word without going to the Edit rotor. There's a Done button near the top left for when you're finished reading about a word. Below the article, there will be additional headings for related stories and more news.
    Not all pictures are described. Mainly, there are captions that are easily read by VoiceOver. However, it's up to publishers to caption images. I haven't found evidence of any alt text that would only be read by VoiceOver, but be invisible to sighted readers. However, I suspect that Apple has made that kind of thing possible. The rotor lets you navigate between images and links while in articles.
    When you're done reding an article, there are other options besides using the Back button at the top left. You can also follow links to other articles in the headings underneath. At the very bottom-right corner of the screen, there's a Next button, which takes you to the next article found in the Today tab or in a particular feed if you're reading articles in the following tab. This makes it easier to jump to articles related to the main story you're reading. You never need worry about getting trapped. There's always a way back to the main screen of any tab.
Topics and Channels:
Basically, topics could be any keywords you think up, or they could be areas of interest. Technology or sports could be a topic. So could accessibility or blindness. When you choose to "follow" a topic, the News app will continue to check for articles matching it whenever you open the app or actively refresh the content of an area you're in with a three-finger swipe downward. Once you double tap on a topic, you can flick right through a list of articles found about it. These are listed in order chronologically.
    Meanwhile, Channels are like big limbs on a tree. They are sources like Wired, Polygon, BBC News, or CBC News that might have many sections. You'll know you're in a channel when you flick right and find a row of different topics right after each other. Being Canadian, I've selected the CBC News channel for our closer examination. They have a fantastic news app that I prefer for viewing their particular content, but their articles are made available in the News app, which can be very convenient. The CBC News channel has eleven sections, starting with Top Stories and ending with CBC Investigates. Flicking right past the last section lands you on the first article in the selected topic. It will start with the first section selected. For CBC News, it is Top Stories.
    Double tap on a section title to select it. To the right of the section list, the feed will change to that section's available articles. As usual, you can double tap on an article of interest to go into it. Use the Back button in the top-left corner to exit an article, returning to the channel, or to exit a channel entirely.
Audio and Video Content:
You're quite likely to encounter links to videos in the lists of what the News app comes up with. While reading through articles, you'll frequently come across play buttons. These will lead to video or audio content that the News app is quite capable of allowing you to watch or listen to. Double tapping such a Play button will cause the content to start being played. While this happens, controls will be available on the screen that let you pause and resume playback and navigate through the content.
    Unlike many other situations, particularly when video is displayed in iOS, the playback controls aren't hidden away. This is very useful with news reports when you want to hear something over again, for example. You may also notice that the VoiceOver rotor has the description and subtitles option present while in the News app. You can choose whether you would like to hear subtitles read out or, if you have a Braille display, have subtitles sent there.
The News+ Proposition:
Keep in mind that if you don't subscribe to the News Plus service, you'll only get a limited selection of curated content. Nothing stops you from adding your own topics and channels. However, you won't be able to get past pay walls where you need to pay a particular magazine or publisher to read the full article on a website. Subscribing to News Plus gives you full access to many of these articles, which you would otherwise have to pay subscription fees to multiple sights in order to access comparable amounts of information. On that plank alone, I think the News Plus service earns its keep and is worth subscribing to.
    In some quarters, print magazine issues may seem pretty outdated. Many of these publications are struggling to keep afloat. True to fashion, Apple has managed to convince many such magazines to offer their content to News+ subscribers. For the price of around $10 US per month, subscribers are given access to full issues of hundreds of magazines. In exchange, Apple pays out revenue from this subscription income. Magazines are also paid based on how long people spend reading particular content included in what is offered to non-subscribers who use what the News app offers freely. This greatly increases the potential audience for individual articles that may very well be of interest to people who would otherwise never purchase the issue of the magazine the article was published in.
    For blind people, this has suddenly made a very wide range of magazines a lot more accessible than they've ever been before, outside of libraries and services that produce special accessible versions of magazine issues. Thanks to VoiceOver and Apple's accessibility design principles used in the News app, people can read articles in synthetic speech or Braille very closely. This allows them to learn how names and unfamiliar words are spelled, look up unfamiliar words, and get more of a sense of how things are laid out. They can also share items of interest with friends and family, especially if they also have a News+ subscription. There is a pretty wide-ranging spread of magazines, and this number is likely to grow over time.
    Some magazines like National Geographic, The Atlantic, and The Walrus are a joy to read as a blind user of News Plus. There were headings, links, and detailed captioned images. The titles of articles were in the table of contents, so you knew where you were going when you double tapped.
    On a really positive note, the entire text of an article can be read through as a single body without having to click a More or Next button. You can just read through the whole thing without any pause if you wish. Using the rotor as described above, closer scrutiny is possible, allowing you to find out how names are spelled and to look up unfamiliar words. The app works well with Braille displays, giving Braille readers access to a tremendous amount of reading material with very little effort involved.
    When it comes to images, VoiceOver has gained in its ability to describe what's there and read any text in those images. This makes even full page ads accessible to blind people. Before now, it used to be only captions on the pictures which VoiceOver users would have to work with. these can be read by VoiceOver. You'll often find them in the middle of articles or on large full-page pictures. Now, with the emergence of iOS 18, you can flick the focus onto an image and wait around a second. At that point, artificial intelligence will begin describing the picture you flicked onto. For this to work, you need to have VoiceOver recognition settings for image description and text recognition turned on.
    Presuming you like the whole idea of more in-depth articles written by people keenly interested in the subject, I believe blind people will find the News+ subscription worth paying for. Overall, I've found articles to be easy to read and very accessible. The new additions to VoiceOver's capabilities further enhance how accessible this wide range of magazines and newspapers are. Provided that you're able to find four or five magazines you keenly enjoy, you're getting more than your money's worth. Subscribing to that many magazines individually would cost far more than what Apple charges for the News+ subscription. The free trial lasts for a month, so if you want to avoid paying the subscription fee after trying it, go to the following tab and down to the "manage" drawer. Expand that and then flick right until you reach the "subscription" option.
    Apple has taken some steps to further increase the value of a News Plus subscription. They have added a collection of fully accessible puzzles. You can always find the "Puzzles" area at the top of the "Following" tab. It is also possible to follow a particular kind of puzzle so that they appear in your "Today" tab when available. The kinds of puzzles available include mini and full size croswords from the New York Times. There is also a tile based word game called Quartiles. There are daily Sudoku puzzles. All of these are fully useable by blind people. Apple has provided all of the options which competitive solvers might wish. There are leader boards. It's possible to have yourself timed or not. People should take the time to explore the screen and investigate the "game options" and "game settings and info" buttons which open screens where choices can be made. In all cases, it is possible to access extensive archives of previously published puzzles.
    Another recent addition is a "Sports" tab. As one might expect, this features all sports related content and has facilities to let you follow games and your favourite teams.
    another recent addition is a section devoted to food. You can find recipes, save them to your personal collection, and be taken step by step through them when cooking. You can activate timers built into the recipes to keep you on track. It's like having a constantly expanding fully accessible cookbook with added functionality.
Using the News app on an iPad:
There are no tabs to keep things compartmented when using this app on an iPad. Instead, there's a sidebar that you can always find the button to show or hide in the top-left corner. When the sidebar is showing, there are buttons running down the left side of the screen, giving access to the Today, News+, and following sections as well as to other areas. I find things easier with my iPad in portrait mode rather than landscape, which I normally prefer. I personally struggle with my iPad, but think that people who are more used to working with the larger screens will have considerably less trouble. Everything is laid out in the same sort of sensible way with headings and buttons. I didn't realize at first that the News+ button used the punctuation mark for "plus" rather than the word. Since my iPad was set to no punctuation, I was initially completely thrown off and didn't clue into how the sidebar worked. You just have to double tap the toggle button to make it appear, and then feel around the left side of the screen for what you want. Then, double tap the content source or area of interest.
    When the sidebar is hidden, the whole screen is then filled up with only the content source you've selected. For instance, if you select the Wired news feed or a magazine issue, that's the only thing that will be on the screen once the sidebar is hidden. Simply double tap the sidebar toggle button when you need it again to navigate elsewhere. Having this option gets rid of a lot of clutter and makes it much easier to focus on a specific article or content source.

Other News Sources and Reference Tools
If you have a favourite news source, the chances are good that they have an app in the app store. These are designed to present their content in the best possible manner on your iOS device. Many of these apps are designed with accessibility in mind and work well with VoiceOver. This is particularly true with apps produced by larger organizations. Both Microsoft and Google have apps that are quite similar to the News app from Apple discussed above. The CBC and BBC also have dedicated news apps. These apps organize content into categories and allow users to easily find and consume content. These apps are free of charge, so you lose nothing by obtaining them and trying them out.
    When magazines and other smaller publications produce apps, they are less likely to consider accessibility. Also, accessing content in such apps often requires you to pay a subscription fee. I have yet to find an app dedicated to a single magazine that has proven to be accessible. Newspapers, on the other hand, tend to have pretty accessible apps. Proceed at your own risk.
    Third party dictionary and thesaurus apps aren't always as easy to use or accessible as they could be. However, I've generally found that they can be used. If you have a preferred reference and there's an app for it in the app store, it's worth checking out at the slight risk of losing your money if it proves to be inaccessible.
    Reference apps can be excellent starting purchases for beginners. They're useful and tend not to offer any opportunities for accidental expense or causing difficulty. Having such resources on your iPhone which you trust won't take up too much space and can make your iPhone feel more like something you're building into your personal digital home. Below are some examples of accessible third-party apps:
The Wikipedia Mobile App: Your Accessible Portal to the Encyclopedia Everyone Built
If you've ever wanted an encyclopedia that was free to use and completely accessible for blind people, you'll want to grab the Wikipedia Mobile app. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia that is made by anyone interested for anyone interested. Thousands of experts and ordinary people who have a deep interest in particular topics write and edit articles. A non-profit foundation called Wikimedia keeps everything going. People can create and edit articles about topics of interest to them. Currently, the English version of Wikipedia has over five and a half million articles about everything under the sun. A core group of volunteer administrators and editors work to deal with disagreements, remove biased information, and maintain overall article quality. Initially, there was a lot of pushback from academia. It wasn't seen as very credible, since anybody could edit it. However, over time, it has continued to gain traction in the general population as a reliable, free, and useful source of information. The apps of other commercially driven encyclopedias have stagnated or simply vanished from the app store. Beyond academia, people simply haven't been willing to pay for the certified expertise of more traditional encyclopedias when they could simply look up information freely online. Things have reached the point where teachers regard it as a good tool to at least start a research project with.
App Layout
There are five tabs starting with Explore on the far left, the Places tab to the right, the Saved tab, the History tab, and at the far right, the Search tab. The screens are easy to flick left and right through. Once you're inside an article, the rotor can help you quickly navigate through headings or to any links. At the top left of all screens, you'll find any appropriate controls for navigating, searching, entering settings, etc. If you're inside an article and want to go back, there will be a Back button at the top left of the screen.
The Explore Tab:
This is where you'll spend most of your time. At the top left is a Settings button giving access to display and other settings. Next to that is a search field where you can type in what you want to look up. After doing this and double tapping the Search button, you'll find a list of results based on your search. Double tap one of these to go into that article.
    Next to that search field, past a title that says Today, there are currently featured articles. Double tap on the title if you're interested in reading the article, and you'll be taken off the main screen into that featured article. Double tap the Back button when finished. Flicking right on the main screen will take you further along to older featured articles. You may also find described images.
The Places Tab:
This tab uses your current location and lists places near where you are that it has articles about. This can serve as a handy travel guidebook. Places can be listed with their distance and direction via clock method next to the place name. There doesn't seem to be any way to sort the order that they appear in the list. Alternatively, they can be shown on a map using the Maps app included in iOS.
    The Saved Tab
    This tab is where you'll find any articles you've chosen to save for later reading. They're available to you even while offline. There's not much to this tab. Just a list of articles you saved. When you're inside a saved article, you'll find a button at the bottom to "unsave" the article, removing it from this tab. Handy for situations where you know you'll be offline for a time and need certain articles ready for use.
The History Tab:
This tab shows a history of all your activity on Wikipedia. You will also find a Clear button near the top left of the screen to wipe this data if you're concerned about privacy. Days are presented as headings, so you can use the rotor to quickly scroll through days of activity. Double tap on an article to get back to it quickly.
The Search Tab:
This final tab is taken up by a search field, where you can conduct systematic searches without any clutter around. Below the search field, you will find a list of all your recent searches that can extend for pages if you use a three-finger upward swipe to scroll down the list.
    Reading Articles
    Once opened, an article takes up the main screen. You'll find the rotor useful to flick between various headings, learn how words are spelled, select and copy text from within the article, etc. Knowing your VoiceOver rotor is very desirable to maximize the usefulness of this app. You can certainly read articles casually without the rotor, but it makes navigation and more careful reading easy. After a heading, flick right, and you'll find an Edit button. Double tap this if you want to change an article. You don't need an account to edit an article. However, your IP address will be kept track of, so there is still accountability. You will also find controls at the bottom of the screen where the row of tabs would normally be. These controls let you view the article in the Safari browser, search within the article, change the display theme, change languages, go to the table of contents for the article, or share the article.
    There are flags and notes in articles that indicate things like whether further edits are needed, whether there's disagreement, etc. Be certain to look for these and also look at the references listed after the article. Each article is written by different people with possibly very different motivations for contributing to Wikipedia's information. Be mindful of that. Things aren't as polished as you'd find in a commercial encyclopedia like Britannica. On the other hand, there's a staggeringly large amount of knowledge in Wikipedia. People need to care enough to bother contributing and messing up articles. There's effort involved. Before dismissing it as useless or trusting it completely, think about that.
Dictionaries and Thesauruses:
There are many dictionary and thesaurus apps available for your iOS device in the app store. It may also be possible to purchase these references as ebooks. The main problem with this latter option for VoiceOver users is that the whole book is searched, rather than just the names of entries. You would therefore often come to an instance of a particular topic or term that would be outside of its actual entry. For example, the word "road" would appear in many places in a dictionary besides where the definition of a road would be found. Apps have search fields that only look at the index of entries so that it is practical to find the information you actually need quickly.
    Unfortunately, these reference apps are not all accessible for blind people. I would urge you to use some caution before spending any money for an app. Before I do, I usually look on the AppleVis site to see if members of that community have had any experience with the app.
    Sometimes, you might need more credible definitions that aren't subject to everyone's edits. This may be especially important for students and writers. There are some nice choices.

The Apple Ecosystem:
Congratulations! Presuming you've read the sections of this guide in order so far, you've come a long way. You'll now have a good grasp of the concepts behind controlling and managing your iOS device. From this point forward, we'll be exploring the countless ways to enjoy its capabilities. To help you make the best choices about what you want from your iPhone, it's helpful to understand the ecosystem you're entering. There are many decisions and philosophies which have shaped the environment of apps and services you've begun to experience.
    When I got my first iPhone, I considered it to be still essentially a phone. I knew it could do even more than my prior accessible cell phone, but didn't think of it as the powerful pocket computer that it truly was. It came with some included functions. I could find out what the weather was like, call, text and email contacts, record voice memos, and use the built-in calendar for example. All of this worked very well with VoiceOver. This was fabulous! Just the idea of being able to buy a mainstream device you heard about on radio and TV shows, and have it accessible to blind people right out of the box, was intensely thrilling to me. That kind of thing just didn't happen outside of wishful thinking. Even more thrilling was the prospect of being able to purchase and download many apps that everyone else used, and have them all just work. I had simply never been in a situation before where the economics of scale could work so powerfully for me rather than against me. Before this, I had actually spent less money on a laptop computer than I spent on the screen reader that made my computer say what happened on the screen. And then, one day in 2011, I walked out of the same store as the sighted people I passed on the street, having paid the same as they did for a device I could use just as well as they could.
    That was the myth that prevailed in the exuberant and eager blind online community I found myself to be a new part of. I knew this wasn't strictly true. There were tens of thousands of apps that were completely inaccessible to blind people, and always would be, since they were just too visual in nature. They didn't employ the accessibility tools Apple had created. It was more like being invited into a playground where you could make use of all the basic equipment plus a smaller selection of really fun installations built by other creators. For a while, you're so captivated by the swings and slides available to you that you don't care that you can't do everything.
    Unlike so many other slices of life where disability can prevent people from inclusion, you're at least in the same playground as everyone else. Due to accessibility tools built into the design, you can often use the same equipment and know enough to be able to help fully sighted newcomers get to know the ins and outs of the place. What's more, Apple, the owner of this playground, did all it could short of force to encourage developers to make their installations as accessible as possible. That's the critical truth behind the myth. If enough stuff is useable, it's still absolutely worth going to the playground. You'll still have a good time. It simply might be a different kind of good time than others can have. You might have to be more creative and adaptive, but you take an important step that can really help when it comes to relating to others who use the same thing. When someone notices you using an iPhone, that can truly help break the ice. Suddenly, blindness doesn't seem like quite the experiential gulf that it often does for people with sight. Being able to use the same familiar device and apps as many of them do can be a powerful point of connection. It can really help them grasp that we live in the same world and share similar hopes.
    All the apps which came installed on the phone were made fully accessible by Apple. Furthermore, Apple had designed its accessibility tools to be useable by developers who wished to make their apps accessible. Provided developers used standard interface elements, many apps would therefore be fully accessible even if developers had made no efforts in that direction.
    Slowly, as I got more apps, music, games, and books, it became easier to understand the overblown enthusiastic joy radiating from the blind people who, being braver than I had been, got into the iPhone earlier. I also slowly began to appreciate the far-reaching effects of the choice I had made that fateful day when I chose to get an iPhone. This section discusses The Larger Picture, which is the full Apple ecosystem. As the owner of an iPhone, iPad or iPod, you are now operating within this larger economic setting. I'll explain what being a part of this ecosystem will mean to you as a user and consumer. If you're more interested in how to use the app store, Apple Books, iTunes etc., feel free to skip to the appropriate section of the guide. This section is for people who want to understand the large-scale implications of deciding to invest in an Apple device rather than one based on Android or other ecosystems like Microsoft or Linux. By this point in the guide, you'll have learned the basics of controlling an iPhone and should be better able to judge if this is the right ecosystem for you. I'll tell you the reasons why I've chosen to use Apple products, and why I'll stick with them barring some catastrophic change in circumstances. My main reason is still the excellent work they've done making their products accessible. It was an easy choice at the time I made it. Pretty much a no-brainer. These days, Android is catching up in this area. It's nowhere near as clear-cut regarding accessibility as it used to be. Hopefully, I can help people make a somewhat more informed decision, at least on the Apple side of the equation. Both ecosystems are basically approaching the same things in different ways. So far, I find no good, compelling reason for me to obtain an Android device in addition to my iPHONE. Apple's device has completely met my needs and desires from a smartphone so far.
The Larger Picture
Apple didn't start out making iOS devices. The company's history extends back to the beginning of home computing in the 1970s and '80s. For a time early in my school years, I owned an Apple IIe that I did a lot of my schoolwork on. These days, Apple has branched out in many interrelated directions. It now makes computers as well as watches, TVs, and many other devices. They now also produce shows, sell books, and offer several services. All of these are designed to complement each other as much as possible. Ideally, Apple hopes that you'll choose to use their products and services rather than the competition. Decisions made by Apple are made in that much larger overall context.
    When you decide to purchase a smartphone or tablet, that choice has broader applications than are immediately apparent. You are deciding to invest in a carefully constructed ecosystem. I discussed this briefly earlier. Now, we will delve more deeply into the ramifications of Apple's ecosystem of interconnected software, hardware, and digital goods and services. I hope this enables people to go in with a deeper understanding of the tremendous economic forces at play shaping what you experience as an owner of an iOS device. There's a prayer by Reinhold Niebuhr that says: "God grant me the serenity to accept what I cannot change, the courage to change what I can, and the wisdom to know the difference." Such qualities will serve you well as you learn to appreciate the advantages and deal with the disadvantages of the world that Apple has built and gone to great lengths to invite blind people into.
    First of all, let's spend some time looking at the overall philosophies behind Apple's iOS ecosystem. One of its main premises is that to provide the best possible customer experience requires proprietary control over and integration of hardware and software. Apple built the iOS operating system to exclusively run products that they themselves created. That sounds more complicated and technical than it actually is. Basically, no third parties can do anything to either the hardware such as iPhones and iPads, nor can they alter the iOS operating system without permission from Apple. Any developers of apps or other companies must play by Apple's rules and with Apple's approval. They are gatekeepers and guardians of their walled garden and strongly believe that this guardianship benefits their customers. This philosophical stance has some pretty profound implications.
    Understand that not all of these implications are purely there to benefit the consumer. Never forget that Apple is a business and seeks to make a profit at every possible turn. Some decisions made by Apple actually limit what is possible to accomplish on their devices to garner participation from more businesses. For example, Apple makes it impossible or harder for people to copy music or books they purchased to sell or give to friends. This decision made it possible for book publishers to make money along with Apple by offering content through their own apps or Apple's. Apple also decided not to allow the sale of pornographic apps or other content on its platform. These sorts of restrictions turn away people who wish to partake in such things. However, such decisions result in gaining increased trust and support from parents, who feel safer giving their children iPads and iPhones because of such choices. The same holds true for all of Apple's extensive and laudable efforts in being environmentally responsible. Good will and trust equal more sales and more overall satisfaction.
    For Apple, security and safety for both users and businesses who participate in its ecosystem has always been highly important. Apple can protect its users from malicious software far better than has yet been achieved on more open platforms like Android. It can enforce rules, making certain that apps with adult content respect parental controls built into the operating system. This has resulted in parents feeling safe giving these products to very young children. Educators have also gravitated to using iPads in the classroom due to Apple's choices when it comes to security. Google has made strong inroads into this space mainly through the price of equipment as opposed to other factors.
    Keeping things simple is another core philosophy for Apple. You will find that the options presented in Settings and other areas are kept quite easy to understand. A complaint that is often levelled against Apple by proponents of the Android operating system, the most notable competitor to iOS, is that users are prevented from doing things simply because Apple has decided not to provide the option. In other words, the hardware in an Apple device might be able to adjust its broadcasting frequency or power level, but there's no option presented to users letting them do so. An example of this is that users of Android phones have been able to change elements of how their phones look to more precisely suit their wishes. They can also exert more control over the hardware in their phones, such as the radios enabling Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities. In the interests of safety and keeping things simple for less-technically minded users, Apple has kept such options far more limited in scope.
    For many people, myself included, this is a far more positive thing than not. I appreciate that Apple is guarding the gate and have yet to be hindered from doing anything I've actually wanted to do with my iPhone. I've also been kept from doing anything which might result in damage to the components in my iPhone. Think of it as choosing to live in a society with laws designed to benefit everyone. However, for some people, having any possible action denied them for even the best of good reasons is fundamentally disturbing and unacceptable. That's something you'll have to decide for yourself. If you can't find happiness within Apple's ecosystem, there are other options available. Although I still think Apple offers a superior experience, especially in terms of accessibility, those other options are now far better than they once were. Apple must actually work to stay ahead these days.
    When it comes to developing apps and testing them for accessibility, Apple has dominated through their efforts as well as other factors. One example is that Apple's product range is relatively small when compared to the myriad number of different systems that a version of Android might find itself running on. Therefore, developers can know for certain what hardware their apps might be running on within a very limited and well-defined range of possibilities. This makes testing and quality control a much easier and less expensive process. Also, the cost of features like VoiceOver and other accessibility tools are spread out and carried by everyone who purchases an Apple product. The days of paying nearly as much to make your smartphone tell you what's on the screen as you paid for the actual phone are a thing of the past, thanks largely to Apple. For most operating systems, other companies develop screen readers, magnifiers, and other accessibility tools which people who need them must pay for. In contrast, Apple takes on the work of creating accessibility tools itself. These features are fully integrated into the operating system. As long as your device supports the latest version of iOS, you need not worry that its screen-reading capabilities will suddenly be out of date. It's that simple. The same holds true for all of the many accessibility features that come built into iOS. Also, it's easier for developers to make certain that apps will be accessible. There's only one screen reader to worry about. Just like anybody else, developers can use accessibility features themselves at no cost to make certain things work as they expect. A central interface for accessibility means that work done to help users with one disability can also help others. For instance, the control and button labelling developers must do in order to support blind users is also now used to let people control their iPhones using their voice rather than the touchscreen. Additionally, all accessibility tools are ready and waiting for people who, through accident, illness, or temporary circumstance, might suddenly find themselves in need of them.
    There is a downside to having accessibility tools made by the same company responsible for everything else. Issues with accessibility tools might not be addressed as speedily as one would like them to be. Blind people comprise a very small fraction of Apple's overall customer base. There are all sorts of pressures to release major operating system updates as soon as possible. It takes something truly show-stopping that would affect practically every iOS user to delay a major iOS release. Even by that minimal standard of quality control, we've seen some truly hideous bugs get through every so often; bugs that you'd have thought were serious enough to warrant a delay until they were dealt with. Examples include a major iOS update that prevented iPhones from actually answering and making calls. Another release caused serious battery drain issues. Apple really scrambled to release a fix for that "no phone call" problem in a heaping hurry. A patch was ready within a couple of days. The battery drain took a lot longer to figure out. Still, another release turned new expensive state-of-the-art iPads into nothing more than inert flat slabs of tech needing to be taken to an Apple Store to be reanimated. Issues like that can shake people's confidence badly. Apple tries very hard to avoid such things, and really has to scramble when they fail to do so.
    And yet, it's still somehow clearly better from an overall business perspective to have new iPhones and operating system versions released before such issues are resolved. Otherwise, by this stage in the maturity of tablets and smartphones, we would no longer be prone to experiencing these sharp regressions in functionality.
    Compounding the issue, No official warnings of such difficulties are ever issued prior to a release. People who test versions of iOS are under strict non-disclosure agreements and shouldn't publicly discuss any such problems prior to release without Apple's permission. They could get into legal trouble. This helps Apple control when their competitors learn about what they're doing, which is critical in maintaining their place in the increasingly competitive market they helped to create. This need for secrecy has also resulted in some nasty surprises for customers every so often.
    Nobody actually wants these bumps in the road for their consumers. Least of all, Apple. However, business pressures to get products out and have newly developed features in the market often clearly trumps the need for more careful testing and quality control with the software that makes everything work. It seems hard to believe that Apple was completely unaware of at least the potential for widespread trouble in the above cases. It can seem absolutely ludicrous to encounter such issues fifteen generations of software into the iOS journey. Even more so if people don't understand how mind-bogglingly complex the device they hold in their hands actually is. The software that makes your experience feel so simple is anything but. Many different departments of very skilled people work on different aspects of the software that is iOS. Artificial intelligence is used to optimize software. Each team has a good grasp of their area of expertise, but might not understand how a decision they made affects everything else. In fact, there may not be anyone alive who fully understands how it all works. Sadly, this can result in decisions that perhaps were made at the last minute after testing was complete going into the ultimate public release and causing trouble. Even worse, issues that are known about may simply be ignored until a future update cycle has time to address them. Things that might absolutely wreck your day may not bother enough other people to warrant speedy resolution.
Part of The Equation:
I took the time to give these examples because there are those in the blind community who have a tendency to feel that they're not much more than an afterthought. This really isn't the case at Apple. Time after time, there has been panic that Apple was making changes that would leave blind people out. In every case, this has proved to be utterly misplaced fear. At Apple, accessibility is one of many very important but sometimes competing objectives. All of them are taken quite seriously. Apple does a great deal to promote inclusion and accessibility. Much of this happens at events like their WWDC. This is a Worldwide Developer Conference for people who make the apps everyone uses. At these events, they award developers who have made their apps accessible. There are videos produced to promote including people with disabilities and making apps accessible right from the start. New accessibility tools and features are demonstrated and taught, so developers can make use of them. Sessions about various accessibility matters are in the schedule. Guest speakers have included the famous blind singer Stevie Wonder, and Haben Girma, a deaf-blind lawyer who graduated from Harvard. These people utilize apps in everyday working life.
    I'll never forget one year when they included a video at the start of a product launch event that was all about the importance of accessibility. It had a blind photographer being told how many faces were in the family picture he was attempting to take. It had a man using hearing aids connected to his iPhone to hear the leader of a hiking group he was a part of. At the end of the video, the audience learns that it has been edited by a lady overcoming her paralysis, using her head to control film editing software as well as things like the shutters on her house windows.
    None of these talented people feel like Apple is just a whim away from cutting them out of their equation. If you're mostly paralyzed and rely on being able to control equipment in your home, you wouldn't make such critical investments in a system if you didn't have faith that the business would consider your interests when making changes. Apple has earned the trust of people who face profound challenges due to disability. For all its faults and missteps, I submit that Apple has earned a level of patience and faith from those of us in the blind community which they don't always receive. They might very well make decisions less favourable to our specific ideal use. In early 2020, I was forced to contend with the ongoing annoyance of having the "misspelled words" rotor action in VoiceOver being broken for an extended period of time. This function had formerly worked brilliantly, making spellchecking documents quite easy. Having it not fully workable until Apple decided to fix the feature made spellchecking my 250,000 word guide a good deal harder and more frustrating than it ought to have been. Thankfully, that breakdown was dealt with soon after I published the first edition. It has been consistently smooth sailing in that particular area ever since.
    I know the developers at Apple aren't simply going to leave us hanging and abandon all work on accessibility. That being said, it does seem like disabled people are somewhat more vulnerable to significant lapses in capability, especially when a major new version of iOS is released.
    Preserving a degree of secrecy about what they're developing so that others don't beet them to the punch is one of the things in Apple's big picture that can prove troublesome. When Apple announced the iPhone X, it made a big deal of the new face-recognition technology and the removal of the Home button with its Touch ID sensor. Many blind people wondered how it would be possible to cope with these changes and presumed wrongly that Apple simply didn't care that it was ditching disabled people who couldn't look properly at a camera. Once again, these concerns quickly proved unfounded. Apple had made certain that gestures replaced the functionality of the Home button and that guidance was given via VoiceOver when blind people set up and used face ID. Everything was still possible to accomplish without sight. The methods had simply changed to accommodate new technology. Unfortunately, Apple didn't make that publicly clear right away. This secrecy allowed these fears to grow largely unchallenged except by people who had faith in Apple but initially had no actual information to counter the concerns of doubters.
    Unfortunately, the bit of truth behind these recurring fears of being abandoned as a market is that even serious accessibility problems simply aren't ever going to trump market pressures to release on schedule. Nor can we expect Apple to delay including some shiny new feature until it has been made as accessible as possible. This can have some grave and even potentially dangerous consequences. Especially for new users who aren't well-prepared to handle complications.
    A drastic example of this kind of pitfall happened with the release of iOS 11. It featured many enhancements to how Braille was handled. However, these changes were rendered useless for people who relied on their Braille display keyboards for input. If all you did was read on a Braille display, that worked quite well. However, you couldn't type at more than a very slow speed, or you'd find that whole words were simply lost and not entered into the system. Something had gone wrong with how input from Braille displays was processed by iOS. This was terrible news if you were deaf-blind and relied on a Braille display to do everything on your iOS device. You were also in deep trouble if you used a Braille display or iPad in the classroom or to take notes in a meeting. In those situations, it's pretty important to be able to type rapidly. There was a lot of bitter anger about this in the blind community. Questions were raised as to how dedicated Apple really was to accessibility if they let idiocy like this happen. The only solution for those effected was to downgrade back to the previous iOS and wait until the issue was resolved. Yet more serious issues cropped up for Braille users during the iOS 15 cycle. They have now been mainly resolved, but it has taken until right near the end of iOS 15's development for this to happen.
    The Apple accessibility department isn't known for raising any alarms prior to a major iOS release. Unless somebody breaks ranks and raises the alarm, people can get stuck with changes which decrease accessibility. Many will therefore choose to wait and see how others do before updating to the latest iOS version themselves. I highly recommend this practice to beginners. The AppleVis website has been given special permission to post information a little before the release of a new iOS version so that people can find out if there are known bugs that would adversely affect them. As far as I'm aware, nobody else has been given such dispensation.
    On a Windows computer with a third-party screen reader, you would at least have gotten warned well in advance that there was trouble and that you shouldn't upgrade yet. The release of Windows 10 is a case in point here. Screen reader companies got the word out quickly that users might want to wait and not upgrade right away. Also, Microsoft extended their offer of a free upgrade to Windows 10 by over a year to accommodate users who relied on screen readers that simply weren't ready in time. Meanwhile, users of iOS were reminded constantly to get the latest iOS version, despite the difficulty they'd face if they did so. What's more, after a short while, it became impossible to downgrade to the prior operating system to avoid problems introduced and not known about until it was too late. In Apple's calculus, it's too important for users to have the security improvements in the latest operating system to be allowed to delay installing it for very long.
    The more special your case is, the more vulnerable you'll be to this kind of thing. For me, this didn't represent a big concern other than to warn people about the issue quickly. I type far faster on a standard QWERTY Bluetooth keyboard than I ever could in Braille. My display was only ever used for reading. I had to go out of my way just to experience the difficulty firsthand. However, I cringed at the thought of being a student who had to contend with his or her Braille display becoming suddenly impractical in the classroom for pretty much a whole term of school. These drastic situations are infrequent, but can happen from time to time. In such cases, there may be workarounds. For example, ordinary Bluetooth keyboards worked just fine. Presuming they could type, students could have obtained a cheep keyboard and used it along with their display. Not ideal, but doable. Similarly, people affected by this more recent voice call bug could obtain a cheaper dumb phone for making actual phone calls, presuming it was workable by blind people. They could then still use their iPhones for other activities until the bug was resolved. Not at all what one should have to do when you've invested in a premium product like an iPhone. Blind people pay just as much as sighted customers. Frankly, they shouldn't have to worry about really drastic bugs like these appearing in what ought to be a well polished and tested iOS update.
My Way or the Highway:
Minimizing cost is always going to be a key motivator for Apple, even when this may inconvenience smaller portions of their customers. One recent example of this kind of thing was when Apple decided to remove the headphone jack from their latest devices and use the recovered internal space for other purposes, including making their products thinner and more water-resistant. This was a very controversial decision, even outside the blind community. People would have to get Bluetooth headsets or earbuds, or use Apple's proprietary EarPods that then took up the Lightning port on their iOS devices. This Lightning port was initially the only means by which they could charge their devices. They'd have to juggle the need to keep their batteries charged with the desire to listen privately to anything while they were doing so. With the introduction of wireless charging, this has become a good deal less annoying to the general public, since the Lightning port is no longer necessary for charging. However, this change was even more of a blow to blind people who required hearing aids. Transmitting audio to a streaming device, and on to the hearing aid via Bluetooth, introduced a significant latency that was quite annoying when you relied on VoiceOver to tell you what was happening on the device. You might make a gesture and then not hear the result of it for a quarter of a second or longer. I had an older but great-sounding Logitech Bluetooth speaker that had this problem. When listening to music or reading a book, there was no issue. However, if you tried to answer a call or type something, that delay might throw off your perception of where the cursor was on the screen enough that you'd hang up on your caller rather than receive it as you intended. For anything other than passive listening, such a delay rendered VoiceOver itself pretty impractical.
    For sighted people who might find this difficult to understand, imagine you're driving down the road in a car. This car responds instantly to what you do, but your perceptions of this are delayed by half a second. You turn to avoid an oncoming car but have no sense that you have, in fact, begun to turn until half a second after you spin the steering wheel. How safe would you feel in a car like that? How fast would you be willing to go?
    Eventually, issues of latency will disappear as Bluetooth technology improves. I'm writing this while wearing AirPods, which are essentially Bluetooth earbuds. While there is still a minuscule amount of latency, I only become aware of it if I switch to using my pair of Lightning-powered wired EarPods or just use the iPhone's speaker. Things seem a smidgeon more snappy at that point. Otherwise, it's such a tiny latency that I'm simply not even conscious of it. I use hearing aids but don't require the audio from my iPhone to go directly to them via a streamer. I can put EarPods or AirPods in and have them fit along with the tiny buds of my hearing aids. The batteries don't last as long, since I need to have the volume considerably higher than people with average hearing would. Alternatively, I can use bone conduction headsets. If people require bone conduction hearing aids or use a kind that fully blocks their ear canal, they won't be able to do what I've been doing. Instead, they'll need to obtain hearing aids designed to work with Apple devices and thereby eliminate the need for a streamer. Bone conduction would be another alternative, but you'd then lose any benefits gained from using Apple's proprietary headsets and earbuds. Otherwise, they would have to use an adapter Apple sells that lets you use a 3.5 millimetre (mm) earphone cord that can then connect directly to a streamer. These adapters are tiny, easily broken, and highly prone to getting lost. You'd be compelled to buy and keep spare ones around. I feel the same way about batteries for my hearing aids. You always want a ready supply of those handy.
    Not requiring these adapters, I was only a little perturbed at the thought of losing the headphone jack. It wasn't a major crisis for me. I eventually got the pair of AirPods I'm now using to hear music, nature sounds, and what I'm writing. While I love not having a wire to snag on things as I move around, it's not a perfect situation. I wish the battery life on the AirPods was longer, since I either need to charge them one at a time for brief periods while I'm working or simply switch to wired EarPods when the AirPods get too low. These days, I often hear such little grievances collectively referred to as "first world problems" by younger smart-mouthed whippersnappers than yours truly happens to be. To use another of their expressions, "I believe I can deal just fine."
    Once Apple makes a decision such as removing the headphone jack from its devices, people shouldn't hold out hope that such a decision will be reversed. Apple typically considers major changes pretty carefully. Just as apps may disappear, hardware features you quite like may also disappear. What's more, it'll be hard to simply walk away if that happens, since only Apple can make iOS devices. You're stuck with what they decide is economical going forward. With the Android ecosystem, anybody can make a phone or tablet that incorporates a headphone jack or their equivalent of 3D Touch. You're not tied into one company's judgement on what's economical to produce.
    Having control of everything helps you run a safe and tidy ship. That can help you and your passengers get more bang for your buck. However, it also means that Apple can charge more for its hardware, which is your ticket onboard. Barring unusual circumstances such as sales, you'll pay more for an Apple product than you will for an Android equivalent. Apple makes a good deal of its money selling hardware. Over time, it has begun making more money through its app store and other services that you need Apple products to use. Apple takes a cut from profits made by developers of apps in its app store. In exchange, it maintains the store that handles the transactional side of things, making it easy and safe for people to buy or increasingly subscribe to apps. Developers don't have to do more than maintain pages for apps in the already constructed, well -run store that uses artificial intelligence to hone in on what customers like, and then recommend apps to them. You can't get apps for your iOS device anywhere else. There's just the one app store. It's Apple's way or ... not even the highway.
    Slowly, but more often than before, this situation is changing. Regulators in the US and other countries are challenging Apple's more proprietary practices. After a decade of people wishing Apple would do so, it switched from using its own Lightning system to using a more standard USB-C port on their products due to pressure from regulators. They have also had to make it possible to install apps from other places besides their own app store. This poses a security risk for people who choose to do this. If they stick to Apple's app store, people can be quite confident that Apple staff have looked at any app they purchase and deemed it safe to use. It's not a foolproof system. Criminals have made concerted efforts to sneak in malicious software and have had some very brief successes. However, there has yet to be any widely devastating breaches. I've felt much safer on my iPhone than I ever have on my Windows computer.
    Another area where Apple flexes its muscle rather carefully is when it comes to using services that compete with those it provides. You are never stopped outright from using such services; however, it's just a bit less convenient to do so. Books have always been near and dear to my heart, so I'll use them to illustrate this key to Apple's success. To obtain a book on your iOS device using Apple's marketplace, the procedure is short and simple. Just open the Books app, find the book you want, double tap on the button with the book's price or the word "get" if the book is free, and then complete the payment process. Presuming you've set up your Apple account, this is as easy as touching the Home button or looking at your device and clicking the Action button on the side of your device twice. People have often bought things they didn't intend to because the process is so easy. After you've bought the book, you just go to the Library tab, or simply use the Read button that has just now surreptitiously replaced the Get button to enter and begin enjoying your new acquisition. It's all very frictionless.
    To break free from Apple Books and enjoy Amazon's often far lower prices for the same books, there are things you'll need to master. You'll need to know how to use a web browser to sign up for your Amazon account, search for, and purchase books. It can take some effort to learn the Safari, Chrome, or Firefox browser well enough to feel comfortable using it for shopping. Of course, you can also use any computer you're more familiar with to sign up, search for, and buy Kindle books. You can then just use the Kindle iOS app to actually download and read the books. Browsing the web on your iOS device is absolutely worth your time to learn how to do, but you'll first need to get relatively comfortable with VoiceOver. Also, you'd better keep track of your Amazon credentials. Keep a file somewhere with any digital identification like passwords or usernames in case you forget them. There's one more thing you'll need to learn, and that's how to use the Kindle app. The Kindle app provides an absolutely wonderful reading experience. However, it is built quite differently than Apple Books in terms of its interface, so you'll have to learn your way around that. For veterans like me with years of experience handling an iPhone, this wasn't very difficult. However, it's very different from Apple Books and the app store. Beginners might find mastering all these elements somewhat daunting at first. They could go through all that trouble, or they could just stick to using Apple Books, having their audio and ebooks all available in one app.
    Is it worth jumping through those extra hoops? That depends on what you want and how much of a reader you are. If you only occasionally buy books, it very well might not be worth your while. You might appreciate having your collection all in one very accessible app on your device. Now that Apple Books lets you purchase and listen to audiobooks, the convenience becomes yet more compelling. You could have your entire book collection in one app using the Apple account and password for any purchases. It's even less painful when you can use Touch or Face ID and only rarely have to type in that password. Apple is banking on people being more willing to spend extra money to get what they want rather than extra time. If people choose to prove Apple is right in this thinking, I feel better if that choice is made from a position of awareness, rather than having my readers discover years later that they would have done things differently had they only known.
    This kind of situation is part and parcel of the iOS experience. You can always make use of competitive services. You can use Netflix for watching shows or movies rather than using Apple's TV Plus service. You can stream music with Amazon or Spotify rather than subscribing to Apple Music. All of this is perfectly possible. Apple doesn't want its customers feeling really boxed in. They simply want there to be just a little more friction when you go outside Apple's well-manicured walled garden. Generally, you'll just need to purchase or subscribe to these third-party services on their own sites using their own apps and create personal accounts for whatever online stores you'll use that fall outside of services offered by Apple. If people can find what they want and get it easily, they won't feel the need to go through the effort of searching for alternatives. If they ultimately insist, better to let them enjoy what they bring back in style on their Apple device. The only point of mild friction is when you want to actually purchase from a third-party offering a competitive alternative.
    If Apple offers such convenience, why would you want to look elsewhere? Let me put it to you this way. I have under two hundred Apple Books after around twelve years using my iPhone as my main device for reading books. This is despite having experienced my first taste of true literary liberty thanks to Apple Books. In contrast, I have well over three thousand Kindle books. Most of those books were bought while on sale for well under $5. Without Amazon's economy of scale, I could never have assembled anywhere near that large a collection of books. That's the kind of advantage blind people have simply been deprived of until now.
    Apple does many things well, but can't do everything as well as companies who specialize in one area. When it comes to Amazon, that area is making books and other things available as cheaply as possible on a truly mind-blowing scale. For me, it's absolutely worth putting in the extra time to learn what's possible. Learning how to browse the Web or use different apps is something you get better at over time, the more you do it. Regarding ebooks, it has quite literally paid off for me. In other areas, such as music, I've been more than content to stay in Apple's walled garden. This satisfaction has only increased since I subscribed to the Apple Music service and no longer need to buy albums I'm interested in hearing.
    When it comes to technology and a delightfully powerful but reasonably simple experience, Apple has consistently impressed me. I've never needed sighted help to set up an iPhone, besides the very first time I did it in the store with the help of the salesman. The iOS operating system is a cost that Apple builds into the hardware price. You never have to pay for iOS or updates to it. Provided your hardware is current or even a few years old, you'll still be able to get the latest updates free of charge. Contrast this with Android, where you might not be able to run the latest version of the operating system until the manufacturer of your device produces a special version for your specific model. That could leave you stranded years behind the latest version of Android, presuming they ever bother to do it.
    In effect, when you pay a higher price for an Apple device, you're paying for curation, convenience, safety, high quality, and simplicity. That's really what Apple is trying to sell you. In exchange for those, you give up money and a degree of control. For instance, Apple pretty much forces you to take a device needing service such as battery replacement to their stores or send it in to have repairs made. This sort of thing is by no means unique to Apple, but they get called on the carpet about how hard it is for consumers to affect any repairs themselves. As with so many other things, after nearly a decade, Apple is slowly opening up to the possibility of third-party repairs that don't automatically void one's warranty. As of March 2022, they will make parts and instructions available to people who are interested in attempting to repair their devices, or to third-party repair shops which will be able to effect repairs.
    We all pay for one or more things in an Apple device that we may have little or no use for. That was initially how I felt about the camera. Back when I got it, there weren't nearly so many apps designed specifically to put the camera on my iPhone to good use, given my blindness. I could have, and sometimes did, use that camera and the FaceTime app to have someone sighted tell me what something was or read printed instructions. Other than that, I had no other use for the camera until the advent of light detector, object identification, and print reading apps. That camera is now one of the most useful bits of my iPhone. Meanwhile, people with no disabilities are paying for maintenance of a screen reader and other accessibility tools that most of them will never need while they use a given device. Presuming they are even aware of that, they have decided that the Apple ecosystem is worth the higher cost of entry.
    Similarly, people who choose to pay for an Android tablet or phone have decided that they can take care of themselves and don't value Apple's sense of what's right. In practice, this has given Apple the edge when it comes to accessibility, which Android has only recently been catching up to as I write this in 2022. By the time Android was anywhere near as blind-friendly, Apple had achieved massive penetration into the blind market. Due to this fast adoption and the tools built into the operating system, the number of accessible apps had grown rapidly. Unlike the AppleVis online community, there was no real central point for blind Android users to rally around. To the best of my knowledge, that's still the case today.
    There are certainly things that might push me out of Apple's ecosystem. They could decide to start charging prices for things that were simply entirely beyond my means. They could stop investing in accessibility improvements, thereby stranding people with disabilities. These decisions would certainly be possible for a large company to make. However, these aren't decisions Apple would make lightly and without warning. The public relations cost would be exceedingly high. People would very much care. Apple is extremely unlikely to abandon the middle-class consumer. Nor do I think the community of people with disabilities that Apple has invested heavily in courting onto its platform will be suddenly left out in the cold. Whenever Apple makes considerable changes, there's a current of fear that things will start to get worse. There are certainly bumps in the road, but anyone who would argue that Apple doesn't care about people with disabilities doesn't have a good grasp of the big picture.
App Store Economics: Money Behind the Magic:
Apple maintains very tight control over what software is allowed to be installed on your device through its management of the app store. You can't obtain apps for your device anywhere else, so developers need to satisfy Apple's rules and policies to have a crack at satisfying you and me. For instance, apps that offer adult content must respect parental controls that Apple's operating systems make available to parents. App developers are not allowed to do anything criminal or sneaky, such as charge payments to their users without the knowledge and consent of customers. This is the area where we will most often feel the effects of decisions Apple makes in its efforts to maintain safety and maximize profits. How much we spend on apps and how well they are maintained over time are of tremendous importance.
    Unfortunately, there are many people who don't take the time to understand how things look from a developer's perspective. There is a widespread myth that once you produce an app, you can then just sit back and rake in the money. This is patently false for many reasons. The most obvious of these reasons is that Apple charges developers simply to have their apps available in the store. If people don't purchase the app in sufficient numbers to offset this cost, the developer loses money unless the app is pulled from the store. Also, Apple takes a 30% cut from every sale of an app. As Apple improves its operating systems, apps must be maintained to accommodate such changes. This takes time, skill, and effort.
    Even since I started working on this guide, the economics of developing apps has undergone substantial changes. For years, apps were sold at incredibly low prices. Many were available for less than a dollar. Competing apps would race each other to the absolute minimum price to attract more sales. The days of extremely cheep and capable apps have proved to be unsustainable for developers of all but the most popular apps. Consumers have paid dearly for their insistence on rock-bottom prices. A number of app developers have found that once fresh sales have dried up, there were ongoing costs to keep an app in the store, maintaining and improving it hoping for more new sales. This lack of a more reliable, steady income has resulted in developers choosing to pull their often brilliant apps from the store or leave them to degrade while they desperately tried to create new apps drawing in fresh sales. Remember that Apple takes a 30% cut from each sale, plus charges developers a regular fee simply to keep an app available in the store. This leaves developers to continue to upgrade and maintain an app for years, in some cases, without any economic incentive other than through having a good reputation among users. That is an important motivation to be sure. However, for it to be of any use, more apps must be created constantly or there's no income. Make no mistake. While apps may often feel magically simple to use, it takes a lot of skill, dedication, and sustained effort to create them.
    In an effort to tip the scales more in favour of sustaining developers and the apps they create, Apple has introduced a few different economic models for developers to choose from. They can still offer their apps for a one-time fee, as they've always been able to right from day one. This approach is still chosen by many developers. However, those one-time costs are increasing. It's no longer uncommon to pay above $10 for a given app. Back in 2013/14, prices of $10 or higher were rarely encountered and shocking. I paid a one-time fee for the Voice Dream Reader app and have enjoyed the ability to read all kinds of electronic documents and audiobooks ever since.
    Another model involves in-app purchases. These have become famous through their heavy use in games. Examples in that area might include extra levels or advantages for players such as special powers or currency, etc. For other kinds of apps, in-app purchases let developers charge for extra features above those offered initially. I have an app called Ferrite Recording Studio that follows this model. I was able to select from a few different sets of features or pay a one-time price to unlock everything. To cover any recording needs I might have going forward, I decided that latter option.
    This also allows for developers to offer an app for free in the app store, letting people try it with no commitment. If they like the app, they can then pay to unlock the app or pay for something that improves the experience. An app called Nature Space is a good example of this. It makes a large collection of recorded nature soundscapes available. Each of them may be purchased for around $2 as in-app purchases. The app itself is free, so you only pay for the sounds that you actually want. It comes with a few of these soundscapes that can be used at no cost, indefinitely.
    For a long time, once you had purchased an app, you basically got any future updates for free. All very nice for the consumer, but not good for developers who had to constantly maintain their apps and try to add features that attracted new sales. Now, Apple has made it easier for developers to charge subscriptions or charge for upgrades. This will hopefully prove more sustainable for developers, so we don't see so many great apps disappear for lack of new sales rather than a loyal and appreciative user base.
    Paying a subscription for an app like you would for access to a streaming service has proved to be an increasingly popular financial model for developers. This provides several advantages for people who like an app enough to pay a subscription. For one thing, people can try an app before they commit and make certain it works for them. This is wonderful for people who wish to see if apps are accessible, since they won't potentially be out any money if they find an app to be inaccessible. Additionally, app developers will be far more economically motivated to keep current users happy and keep a steady income from a popular app going. They can spend more time improving and maintaining an app more sensibly, rather than always chasing new sales just to keep afloat.
    There is, needless to say, a degree of pushback from people who don't want to have to keep paying for apps along with other services they might subscribe to. This is popularly known as "subscription fatigue". As someone who had nearly a decade of not having to subscribe to apps I valued, I absolutely sympathize with these annoyed consumers having to adjust to this swiftly changing economic reality. However, I've seen too many brilliant apps and games that I only had to pay for once disappear from the app store or simply stop working as iOS changed around them. People are often genuinely unaware of the cost involved in simply keeping an app in the app store. Apple extracts a fee for this, as well as taking a 30% cut from each sale. Also, there is the ongoing effort required to improve and maintain an app as the iOS operating system changes how things work. I believe this shift is ultimately a healthy one for people interested in apps that will last a long time and remain stable. The ongoing relationship with developers offers far more incentive to keep a good thing going and getting better.
    Of course, subscriptions don't make good sense in all cases. Many apps are created with an idea of being used for a shorter while. Others are created with the hope of raising the profile of an app developer. Others are supported by advertising revenue. There are many apps that I would never think of paying a subscription for. If I'm to do so, there must be a compelling reason for that deeper relationship. I expect greater value for that commitment. Recently, I came across Castro. It's a podcast app that offers its core capabilities for free. This is good, since there are many alternative podcast apps, including the one Apple provides with iOS. It takes a very different approach to organizing podcasts, and it also offers other features that make me feel that I'll get my money's worth by subscribing. The same holds true for the other apps that I subscribe to, namely Twitterrific, Ulysses, Fantastical, Headspace, and Deliveries which tracks parcels. In each case, the apps and their developers have provided something that I value enough to support beyond a one-time purchase.
    There's an outcry of worry that people will find themselves nickelled and dimed to death as developers switch on mass to a subscription model. I know better than to worry. Having something over three hundred apps and games, I currently only pay subscriptions for under ten apps that aren't content providers like Netflix. In each case, I could have found other alternatives. I haven't been forced to pay subscriptions to accomplish anything. These have been choices I've made freely because the approach taken by the particular apps is more suitable to my current needs. People are still figuring out the conventions of which economic model is best for different kinds of apps. Apple has gradually opened up to more possibilities. The basic problem is that many excellent apps are only useful to a smaller subset of users. They don't generate the kind of sales needed to remain viable and disappear after a while. Consumers were living in ignorance of the economic stresses the people who tried making a living through creating apps were going through. Now developers have more room to find their economic feet.
Taking Stock:
What does it mean when I say that I'm very invested in the Apple ecosystem? Quite simply, I would lose a lot of built-up assets if Apple were to suddenly shut down or make decisions I truly couldn't live with. Take my happy arrangement regarding Apple Music. I have crafted a library of nearly ten thousand tracks. This grows as I try out new albums and decide they're worth adding. It also shrinks slowly as I decide I don't like a particular track and remove it from my library. I also built playlists as I added albums or songs so that I have one list with actual songs and another with instrumental music that I have playing while I write. Furthermore, I have a smaller selection of music that I have deemed worthy of keeping on my iPhone, so I can hear it without using data while not connected to Wi-Fi. If Apple ever decided to pull the plug on the Apple Music service, all of that work and most of that music would simply vanish on me. This would also happen if I stopped paying Apple around $10 per month to have access to the Apple Music service. At best, I might be able to export the playlists for my own keeping, and then use them with another streaming service or slowly purchase the albums I truly valued. It would be painful. However, I don't believe there's any near-term danger of this happening, so I remain happy. I have enough faith in how Apple has handled things so far.
    There are many other ways that I have become deeply invested over the years. There are the hundreds of apps and games I've purchased. They won't run on anything that isn't an iOS device, and only Apple designs those. I have taken the time to master VoiceOver and become versed in all aspects of the iOS user experience. I pay for extra iCloud storage. There are all sorts of things, both financial and mental. Over the years, Apple has earned my trust, admiration, affection, and appreciation. I feel won over fair and square. Even if someone came out with a truly better, more affordable system tomorrow, I would be very hesitant to jump ship at this point. If you use an iOS device to anywhere near its full potential, you'll quite possibly feel similarly to me. Users of Android devices develop a similar attachment to their chosen ecosystem, which has its advantages and pitfalls.
    I felt that it was very important to write about this aspect of ownership. In my experience, it presents a long-term economic choice of a kind that blind people have never been able to contemplate before. iOS devices offer blind consumers the chance to really leverage large-scale marketing to our advantage, rather than have niche marketing force us to pay more for far less capability. At the same time, I hope I've made the potential pitfalls that come with those economics clear enough. I would much rather have people read this and decide not to enter the Apple ecosystem than have people who end up bitterly disappointed and feeling trapped wishing they understood the implications better earlier. It was only very slowly, long after I had purchased my first iPhone, that many of the implications of this choice became clear. I have no regrets at all and am convinced I've made the best choice possible for me given my circumstances and abilities. However, other people might choose to dip their toes in carefully while they try things out.
    One final bit of overall advice I feel compelled to pass on now rather than later is that you never put off enjoying what you purchase or obtain in the belief that it's truly permanent. Apple's publishing rights and rules can and do change over time. Also, due to technology updates, things might not be workable or available to yourself and others down the road. I've had a few slightly painful personal examples of this. For instance, one Apple book I was very much hoping to finish is called Franklin's Lost Ships. I bought the book the year that the remains of the Franklin expedition were found in the arctic. I had read around a quarter of the book, but got distracted by other books for a time. When I once more tried to continue reading it, I was dismayed to find that it wouldn't read properly any more using VoiceOver. I could still read it word by word, but that's no way to enjoy a book. I still hope that things will once again come to a point where I can finish reading it enjoyably.
    Technical advances and harsh economics have also rendered some apps and a few truly remarkable audio games unusable and unavailable in the app store. I dearly wish I had more fully experienced these now lost treasures while I had the chance. I had simply made a false assumption that things would remain as enjoyable and available as when I had first bought them. Another very good and accessible game has more recently fallen foul of a rule change by Apple in an attempt to combat gambling fraud. They decided to remove all apps that even simulated gambling from the app store. There was a procedure for developers to receive exemptions from this purge. Larger companies could complete it and have their apps stay, provided they passed scrutiny. However, developers of accessible games tend to be very small, and the developer of Fruit Pot simply couldn't expend the resources to go through this procedure. As a result, the blind community lost a stupendously good slot machine simulation game that didn't even have in-app purchases. Thankfully, in this case, the developer wasn't lost to us. Fruit pot is now back in the app store once again. Also, his follow-up game called Westopia takes playing slots to an even higher level.
    You don't have to worry constantly that things will disappear or become unworkable very often. For the most part, developers keep their apps up to date. I'm still using some apps that I've had since my first year of owning an iPhone. All the other books I've purchased in Apple Books are still perfectly readable. These instances are rare, but they can and will eventually happen to you. Change is an integral part of the iOS ecosystem.
    Ultimately, I'm deeply grateful for the massively increased engagement with cherished aspects of life that Apple's iPhone and ecosystem has made possible for me. It has been well worth putting up with such issues to reap the immense benefits of participating in this ecosystem. The vast majority of my experience in the world that Apple built has been quite positive. That makes me far more inclined to forgive the inconveniences inflicted on me as Apple tries very hard to please as many of its customers as possible. I know there'll be other bumps in the road for me going forward. However, in my experience, Apple has done a pretty good job of addressing problems relatively quickly. I hope this look at the Apple ecosystem helps people understand what's going on and be more effective when they rightly complain, ask for change, or simply opt out of the whole enterprise.

Apple Music and the iTunes Store:
It's time for all of your practice and learning to be rewarded. As stereotypical as it might be, I think that as a blind person, you're highly likely to appreciate music deeply. I'm about as unmusical as it's humanly possible to be. However, I nonetheless deeply appreciate music in my life made by people who are marvellously competent in this art. It seemed very fitting for this and other reasons to have this aspect of what Apple offers be the first of its services to introduce you to.
    The people at Apple have always deeply valued music. They have ended many keynote presentations with live performances from top musical talent. They created iTunes, iPods, and more recently, the Apple Music service. Along the way, they've deeply impressed me with the many extravagant gestures they've made to spread that love of music.
    In years past, I was thrilled to be able to attend the iTunes festival, which later became the Apple Music festival. It was a month-long series of concerts held in the Roundhouse stadium in London, England. Through my iPHONE, I was able to tune into the live streams of these concerts or hear videos of ones I missed. It made a wonderful addition to Summer time. I was introduced to all sorts of music, which I still listen to all these years later. The Pretenders, One Direction, Elton John, and many more acts have participated.
    In the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, Apple helped give everyone a chance to listen to music from live talents performing from their homes or other locations all over the world. These performances were interspersed with videos from health workers and officials from many countries in an attempt to generate funds to help the world deal more effectively with Covid-19. The event was called Stronger Together. The event raised millions of dollars and demonstrated what was possible if people were willing to pitch in.
    Your iOS device is an incredible and accessible way to explore and enjoy music. I've been adding to my collection ever since I got my iPhone 4. The ability to carry around enough music to last days without even coming close to filling the memory onboard your device has been a powerful attraction. Apple has its own proprietary music file format, and you can't just fill your device with MP3 files unless you get an app that can handle them. Again, it's a case of convenience versus cost. If you buy into Apple's ecosystem, I think you'll find that music is an area where Apple treats its customers handsomely.
    There are two ways to get music from Apple for your iOS devices. It is delivered in a format especially designed to sound good on iOS devices. You can either buy music on iTunes, which is yours to keep, or subscribe to the Apple Music service. This gives you access to over 75 million tracks, curated playlists, Internet radio stations with top DJ talent in charge, and many other benefits provided that you pay a monthly subscription. If you don't pay, you lose access to any music collected that you haven't bought from iTunes. These options are not mutually exclusive. You can own iTunes music and still subscribe to Apple Music without forfeiting anything. We'll look at the merits of each option in this section.
The iTunes Marketplace:
The iTunes Store app gives you the ability to purchase music as well as movies and TV shows. You can also rent movies. Many now have audio description. Look right after the title and rating for images that are announced by VoiceOver to make certain a movie or show has closed captioning or audio description. Have plenty of storage space, as movies are large. Songs and albums comprise only sound and take far less space. Records are kept of all purchases made, so you can remove content from your device and re-download it as needed. Everything is tied to your Apple account. Remember it and your password always. Use the Music and Search tabs found across the bottom of the iTunes Store app to find and purchase desired albums or songs. In the iTunes & App store settings found in the Settings app, you can customize whether you want to use cellular data when downloading new purchases. Furthermore, you can choose which kinds of purchases to download automatically when you make them. Also, you'll see whether you've set touch ID to be able to authorize purchases or whether you must simply use your password all the time. It's a good idea to look through those settings as well as the Touch ID & Password settings and be familiar with your options. If you have concerns about others accessing your device, you may prefer Touch or face ID so that your fingerprint can authorize purchases, and people won't see you entering your password.
    When you open the iTunes Store app, you default to the Music tab. It's at the far bottom left of the screen. At the top of the Music tab is an options area with Genre, Featured, Charts, and Item List buttons. The Item List is a wish list you can add to using the Share button in an item's entry. For instance, "share" an album and choose the Add to Item List button from the menu that appears. The iTunes store works just like the app store. Double-click on an item title to go to that item's entry. Use the Back button at the top left to back up one level. Use the Get button or the button that shows the purchase price of an item of interest to obtain that item. You will be prompted to authorize the purchase by password or Touch ID.
    You can also find spoken word material, which is treated the same as music on iTunes. The CBC or Canadian Broadcasting Corporation puts up many of their audio drama productions and popular radio series as albums for sale on iTunes. It really pays to search and explore. I've found some excellent audio dramas made available through iTunes. If you have a computer, you can get iTunes software and authorize it to download and play content. This makes it possible to more physically back up what you have purchased if you wish.
The Music App:
This app is how you play music purchased from Apple or available through Apple Music subscription. If you subscribe to Apple Music, this app will be all you need to enjoy, obtain, and manage music on your device. If you don't intend on using Apple Music, you'll still use the Music app for enjoying what you purchase from the iTunes store. Either way, you should go to the Music settings in the Settings app. We'll go over these later in this section.
Listen Now
Think of this tab as a kind of home page or starting point geared especially for your listening preferences as Apple understands them. There are many headings which divide this tab into sections, pointing you to various content judged likely to be of interest. Not everything fits on a single screen. It is a scrolling stack of resources, so you'll be using plenty of three finger swipes to navigate up and down this stack.
    Many of the headings in this tab are similar to those in the Browse tab. However, the content always takes your interests into account. For instance, the "New Releases" tab will feature new material from artists you have added previously to your library or playlists. The tabs about different playlists or kinds of music will similarly tend to be populated with content about artists which you already enjoy or that you're perceived by Apple's artificial intelligence as very likely to enjoy.
Browse:
This tab appears to the right of the Listen Now tab and to the left of Radio. It lets you explore the gigantic collection of videos, interviews, extras, albums, and songs made available to Apple Music subscribers. It has all sorts of curated paths to help you get to the kind of music you want. Great for when you don't know specifically or can't remember artist or song names. This tab and the Listen Now tab contain much of the expertise you invest in when subscribing to Apple Music. Knowing how to use the VoiceOver rotor is useful, since there are headings dividing what the Browse and Listen Now tabs contain.
    The difference between these two tabs is the scope of interest. The Browse tab is a more general, wide look into the Apple Music collection, which is less tailored to your interests and more about what's new and popular. It's a great way to broaden your musical horizons and find new favourites.
Radio:
This tab will always have the Apple Music 1 radio station, which is Apple's flagship music station featuring famous personalities and DJs. It streams 24-7 and has a wide variety of shows. The primary focus is on modern and brand-new music. A slate of shows with live DJs and other famous personalities keep the tunes and information coming in right around the clock. This station has recently been joined by a pair of newer flagship stations. Apple Music Hits concentrates on programming which features modern and older popular hits. Similarly, Apple Music Country brings modern country music to listeners. Just like with Apple 1 Music, these stations also have their personalities and slate of programs.
    Rather than simply emulate a radio station, Apple has done all that it can to enhance the listening and community experience. Each station has a calendar with all of its shows, so you can get to know what's happening at different times of day. Also, previously aired episodes are made available for on demand listening, so you never have to miss out on a favourite. Subscribing to Apple Music will grant access to a great many more specialized stations whose music is curated by experts plus Apple's artificial intelligence. Apple hires experts and famous people in the world of music to be DJs and produce special shows. Elton John is one such famous person who has long had an association with Apple. To learn more about this tab, please refer to the section of this guide called "Internet Radio and Podcasts".
Library
This is where music you have purchased or added to your collection resides, and where you can sort and manage it. There are buttons across the top, including Edit, Playlists, Artists, Albums, Songs, and Downloaded Music. These let you focus on the part of the collection that interests you. Pressing Downloaded Music reduces what is shown to only that music you've chosen to store on your device. Use this button when you're offline or don't want to use cellular data to stream music. Otherwise, any music you want to hear is simply grabbed and streamed for you. Competing with other priorities, the music on my device is slowly whittled down to what I most treasure. In late 2021, I have around, 5500 pieces of music on my iPHONE. These are high-quality Dolby Atmos files which take up around 44 GB of storage. While Apple doesn't differentiate types of music and calls all of them songs, I maintain two playlists. One is for pop music for casual listening and contains around, 3448 songs. If I let it all play, this list would require around 215 hours to hear completely. The other playlist I have contains instrumental tracks. I have around, 2641 of these tracks which would require around 146 hours to hear. These are what I use when writing and are usually played shuffled, so I never know what's next. It all adds up to around 44 gigabytes of music. This expands and contracts as I find new songs and eliminate ones I end up not liking. I have thousands more tracks in my library which aren't on my device.
    If I had the equipment to enjoy them, I could have chosen to download tracks in much higher quality and data-consuming lossless files. These preserve the maximum possible detail of sound and can be played on higher end headgear and speakers than I'm ever likely to have. Once you have hearing loss, there comes a point of diminishing returns for such investments. I selected middle quality files since my AirPods can support Dolby Atmos. I could, in a pinch, have gone with lower quality files, saving space in exchange for quality which many people would be unable to perceive the difference between. Unlike other music services, Apple doesn't charge extra for access to these lossless quality files. It simply cost more data to make use of them.
Search:
This tab gives you the ability to search for artists or songs both inside your library or in the larger Apple Music collection. Double tap the edit field and type in what you want to look for. Note the buttons near the top that let you decide whether to look in your library or the entire Apple Music collection. Flick over the results and double tap on any that interest you. If it's a song or album, you'll be focussed in on that content. Use the Back button at the top left to get back to the broader search results.
The Now Playing Screen or Mini Player
This element of the app is crucial to your full enjoyment. While albums or other content is displayed, the mini player will be available right above the tabs at the bottom. It's easiest to touch the tabs and flick left, essentially moving up onto it. There are Pause and Skip buttons, plus the title of the track you're hearing. Flicking left gets you to a place where you double tap to expand the player. This puts you in the Now Playing screen.
    The Now Playing screen puts the focus on what you're listening to now. The tabs will be unavailable until you dismiss the Now Playing screen. The button to do this is always on the top left. Next, there are Next, Previous and Pause buttons. You'll also find a handy volume slider, and Shuffle and Repeat buttons. Playback Destination lets you switch to other connected speakers, headphones, etc. Great for quickly sharing music if you have a Bluetooth speaker paired and turned on. Any artwork associated with the album or song is displayed. The More button is important and gives access to options to remove, download, or perform other actions like adding the song or album you're hearing directly to a playlist. I use the More button often when I want to remove tracks I don't currently want stored on my iPhone when they come up. This way, they just disappear but are still in my library in the Cloud should I ever want them again.
    It is possible to display the lyrics of songs you're listening to. Look for the "Lyrics" button on the "now playing" screen. You can read these with VoiceOver out loud or with a Braille display. If a track has no lyrics, such as my instrumental tracks, the lyrics button will be dimmed and inactive.
Music App Settings:
There are many settings specific to the Music app that can configure it to your liking. As in other areas, these settings are divided up into groups under headings. The topmost heading is Apple Music. The single setting immediately below is Show Apple Music. If you plan only to use music you've purchased from iTunes, you can set this to "off", which declutters your app by removing everything that you must be a subscriber to Apple Music to use.
    The next heading is Library. There are a few settings beneath this heading that concern whether songs are added and under what circumstances. Another choice is whether changes made on your device are synced across all of your devices. Finally, you can decide whether cellular data may be used to affect such syncing and changes.
    The next heading is Downloads. Beneath this heading, you will find several settings to help manage how much music content is on your device, taking up space. The first button displays how much capacity is taken up by music content on your device. Double tap it to enter an area where you can precisely edit this content, removing what you don't want at the moment. You'll next find an Optimize storage option that allows you to set a minimum capacity level. For instance, you may decide to set it to 16 GB. As long as you have 16 GB or less of music content on your device, this will behave as normal. However, if your device gets full, songs that you don't listen to will be automatically removed to free up storage. The minimum level of 16 GB will be preserved, so you'll know that at least this much music is available for offline listening. The last setting in this group lets you decide whether music you add to playlists is automatically downloaded to be available for offline listening.
    The next heading is Playback. I visit this group of settings often. This is where you can find the EQ setting that changes the acoustics of the music you hear to better suit the music or your circumstances and listening equipment. There are a wide range of different settings, such as Piano, Electronic, Classical, Pop, etc. I like the one called late Night. It emphasizes the base and treble in music, and works particularly well for me with my hearing loss. It can be mildly annoying to have to go into settings to change the EQ setting, but the results can be very much worth the bother.
    There is also a Volume Limit setting. I don't use this, since it limits the maximum overall volume, rather than just for music. However, this may be helpful in some circumstances. There is also a Sound Check setting. According to the user guide, this will help normalize the volume of music, so you don't get potentially sharp, startling differences between songs.
    The last setting in this group has to do with whether Apple and others can see what you've played. Anybody can follow you and listen to what you're choosing to hear. Also, the data is used by Apple's artificial intelligence to make better recommendations to you. Having used Apple Music for over a year now, I have to say that Apple's recommendations have proven to be excellent. I've certainly benefited from Apple's artificial intelligence and human curation.
The Apple Music Service:
This subscription service lets you access any music in Apple's vast collection of over 75 million songs. They offer many ways to do this, including creating radio stations based on music you like on the fly, curated playlists and recommendations tailored to you specifically, and much more. You can store favourite albums and songs on your device, so you're not streaming them using up data when you hear them. You can use an optimize music option to remove songs not played often from your device. It remains a part of your library. As long as you pay the roughly $10 per month charge, you have access to the music you want.
    Taking this approach, you need not use the iTunes app at all. Everything is integrated into the Music app found on your device. The Listen Now, Browse, Radio, library, and search tabs let you take advantage of the many aspects of the Apple Music service. This brings the number of tabs across the bottom of the Music app to five, with Listen Now at the far left and search at the far right.
    You are buying access to the collection as well as expert guidance and curation performed both by people and by Apple's artificial intelligence. This system learns about you as you listen, make choices, and react to what you hear. It doesn't observe you with sensors or anything. However, let's say you skip to the next song before the one you're hearing finishes. Apple's artificial intelligence might take this into account when deciding what songs it should recommend to you. You can also "love" or "dislike" songs you hear, which teaches Apple about your music preferences, further increasing the suitability of recommendations.
    While working on this section, I decided to look in the Browse tab to take this expert curation for a real spin. I wanted music suitable for working to, and quickly came to a heading touting playlists of such music that was regularly updated by Apple's curators. I chose the Pure Focus playlist and have been pleased with what I've heard for the past half hour. Here's another one. Each week, Apple Music comes up with a list of twenty-five songs that it thinks I'm likely to enjoy. More often than not, I've ended up adding songs and entire albums to my library based on its educated guesses. Apple's artificial intelligence and human editors have led me to discover a great deal of fabulous music, which I deeply appreciate.
    There are other perks such as special early releases, videos, and interviews by artists. Special events like album releases and special shows happen from time to time. As I write this, a large-scale festival is apparently in the planning stages.
    When unsubscribed, the Radio tab gives access to Apple Music 1, an Internet radio station broadcasting 24-7 with people like Elton John and other renowned musicians providing programs. This is Internet radio with serious money put behind it. Subscribing to Apple Music provides access to many more expertly run stations in that tab. Also, it is possible to create radio stations on the fly based on the song you're currently hearing. One of the options revealed by double tapping the More button in the music player is Create Station. Using this will instantly create a playlist featuring the artist you're hearing plus similar artists and songs. If you hear something that catches your interest, you can easily check out the artist and add songs or albums to your library.
    New subscribers get a three-month trial before they must start paying. It is also possible to be subscribed to the Apple Music service as part of your Apple One Premium subscription bundle. Many tiers of this set of bundled services include access to Apple Music.
Final Thoughts:
For people on tight budgets wanting a fully accessible way to enjoy music, Apple now offers an extremely compelling option with the Apple Music service. This is even more the case if your iOS device doesn't have much storage space. To take full advantage, you need a good Wi-Fi or cellular data plan. This is vital if you're going to stream your music or listen to Internet radio stations. Provided you have that, you're just about good to go. Hardcore fans will appreciate the many extras, like interviews with their favourite artists, curated playlists and collections, artist videos, etc. You'll never run out of new things to listen to. New albums, playlists, and more are added all the time. If you hear something cool while out and about, chances are you can add it to your personal library without paying anything beyond your subscription fee. Another nifty addition has to do with Siri. You can ask Siri to play the top songs of a time period, shuffle an album or playlist, add songs or albums to your library, skip songs, and much more. It's like having your own personal DJ. If you don't recognize a song, you can ask Siri what it is. You can ask Siri to rate songs from one to five and tell it what you do and don't like. This improves songs selected for you and influences the contents of the Listen Now tab.
    I've come somewhat late to this music party. The whole idea of not owning what I liked discouraged me from subscribing to Apple Music earlier. There's a mind-blowing lot to explore. Blind people are completely on an equal footing. Everything is fully accessible using VoiceOver. Musically speaking, I couldn't be happier.
Cherished Pop Songs:
Here is a selection of some of my current favourite songs. They're in no particular order. I just played my list of pop music on shuffle and added ones I particularly liked when they came up. They are all available on Apple Music. Be sure to check out the artist if you hear something you like. I only picked a single song from any particular artist, but most have done numerous songs that I enjoy very much.

Cherished Modern Instrumental Music
Often, I like to hear instrumental music while I write. Over the years spent working on this guide, I've been delighted to discover many excellent modern instrumental tracks thanks to Apple Music. I've never really been a fan of older classical music. However, I've grown quite fond of piano pieces as this list illustrates. I've followed exactly the same procedure as I did creating the above list of songs. I've let my thousands of tracks of instrumental music play in shuffled order and written down the names of pieces that particularly struck me as deserving of inclusion. As before, I've limited artists to one track each in the list. Most of them have produced numerous tracks that have inspired me and kept my spirits up.

    Bonus
    Those who subscribe to the Music app can also find spoken word content if they know what to look for. Some truly marvelous material is made available from the CBC Radio Archives. Look for anything by Stuart McLean. He was the man behind the exquisitely funny Vinyl Cafe show, much beloved by listeners of CBC Radio. A vast amount of that material can be found and enjoyed. Also, you can find seasons of a lot of other CBC radio shows. Look for Under the Influence, The Debaters, Afganada, and much, much more. You should also try searching for CBC, BBC, and NPR to see if material from each organization might be available for your listening pleasure.

Browsing the Web Using the Safari Browser:
The basics of the Internet haven't changed. However, it can certainly feel different to beginners who aren't used to surfing the web on a flat touchscreen. It will likely feel complicated and clunky at first if you aren't used to VoiceOver gestures. Let's break that down a bit. Part of the slow, awkward feel you'll initially have is typing on a flat screen, which is never going to feel altogether not clunky. However, there's always dictation available whenever a virtual keyboard is used. Find the Dictate button or invoke Siri and tell it to type something for you. However, once you're at the right web address, there isn't usually all that much need for a lot of typing.
    The real key to competent, speedy web browsing on your iOS device is being familiar with VoiceOver gestures and concepts. Once you understand VoiceOver and have a basic familiarity with the gestures, things suddenly become very intuitive and simple. That flat surface and set of gestures changes with practice from different to absolutely delightful. These days, when I need to browse the web on a computer rather than my iPhone, the keyboard and screen reader I once thought represented the best in accessibility feels alien and clunky. I now do all important web transactions, including online shopping, downloading content, and much more almost exclusively on my iPhone. It feels safer and more natural to me now.
    Things have advanced to the point where even very complex forms on websites can be dealt with effectively using VoiceOver. I've been able to fill out census forms online without difficulty. Shopping, borrowing books from a digital library, and even participating in games played using a web browser are all perfectly possible using VoiceOver and your browser of choice.
    The rotor is especially useful for quickly getting around websites. It is perhaps the most vital set of gestures to be proficient in using when it comes to browsing the web. Using the rotor makes it possible to quickly navigate between headings, links, form controls, and fields, etc. That, plus the good old double tap, will take you very far, indeed.
    For this guide, I'll focus on the Safari browser, which is included in iOS. It is easy to learn and absolutely everyone who owns an iPhone will have it installed automatically. You can find settings for it in the Settings app. I'll cover what a lot of them do in this section. Safari is by no means your only choice of browser on iOS. The Firefox and Chrome browsers are also available, and there are even more choices in the app store. Microsoft's Edge browser, the Brave browser, Ecosia, and others have appeared over time. Other browsers typically have menu buttons and have settings reachable within the browser or in the Settings app. All of these are free, popular, and fully accessible with VoiceOver. You can have more than one browser. It has now been made possible to choose which browser you want to use as your default. You therefore don't have to deal with Safari if you prefer something else.
Why It's Worth Learning:
Perhaps, this is your very first time having a device that lets you go online. In that case, there's a lot of brand-new territory awaiting you. Having an accessible means of accessing the Internet in my pocket has been so very liberating and useful beyond my ability to convey with words. I've been using the Internet for far longer than I've owned an iPhone. It has simply become an indispensable part of everyday life for me. Websites are set up by all kinds of organizations, businesses, enthusiasts, and individuals. You'll find journals called blogs about all manner of subjects. There are city and community websites that let you know what's happening where you live. These days, a lot happens online. Accessing the web is becoming more of a necessity than a luxury. It's how we keep in touch with people. From government services being easily accessed online, to shopping for accessible gear that isn't found in local stores, the possibilities of what you can do are endless once you're on the web. It is a world where blind people can leverage their knowledge and access technology to do quite a lot for themselves and others. There are all sorts of compelling reasons to learn how to browse the web.
    Perhaps, you're a long-time veteran of the Internet through a laptop or desktop computer. You're experienced, comfortable, and proficient on your computer with your preferred screen reader. In that case, the question to address is why you should bother learning to do things using an iOS device rather than simply doing everything with your computer. Portability is the very compelling answer to that question. Even before the mobile browsing experience was anywhere near as polished as the past decade of development has made it, millions of people jumped onboard due to the sheer convenience. People can keep in touch with their social circles, put holds on library books, shop for groceries, do banking, and settle arguments using a device they can keep in a pocket and hold in one hand. To be able to pull your iPhone or iPod from your pocket and shop or find information while standing on a sidewalk is a massive draw for blind and sighted people alike. Your web browser is a very empowering tool. It is the gateway in Apple's walled garden, letting you safely and privately explore the wider Internet world from wherever you might happen to be.
    For me, this capability has come into play countless times over the decade I've owned an iPhone. I've been able to check for the latest news from the many websites that cater to my particular interests while in a car or in bed. I've enjoyed having the ability to read menus of restaurants posted online more often than not. This has let me forego having my sighted companions or restaurant staff read the menu. The same kind of thing holds true for knowing what's available or possible in various places I go to. When sighted people are on the clock and in a rush, you often don't find out things while shopping or accessing places with their assistance. With the best of intentions, they limit what they tell you about in the interests of saving time. Not so for websites. They are patient purveyors of all sorts of handy information that is, for the most part, kept up to date. A website doesn't care if you take your time and explore at your own pace.
The Search Field:
We begin our exploration of the Safari screen near the bottom. Just above the row of buttons with "back" on the left and "tabs" in the bottom-right corner, you'll find an area called the search field. This is an edit field where you can type in either a term or terms to search for, or else an address of a site you wish to visit. Typically, this field will display the current web address of the tab you're in. Double tapping it puts you in an edit mode where you can enter a new address to go to. When finished typing in the address, hitting the Go button in the bottom right of the keyboard will take you there. This is how you directly drive around the web. To clear the current contents of this address field, flick right, and you'll come to a Clear Text button. Double tap that, and you'll be back in the edit field that is now empty and waiting for a new address. Alternatively, you can type a search term into this edit field. When you then use the Go button, a search for the terms you entered into the edit field will be made using whichever search engine has been set as the default.
    Double tap the "Go" button which appears in the bottom-right corner when the edit field is active. That's how you get places. Everything else we'll describe from this point out is there to support your online browsing.
    Immediately to the right of this important field while it's not ready to receive typing, you'll find a button called "refresh". This button lets you reload a site which might not have loaded correctly. This will certainly happen from time to time. To the left of the field, you'll find a button called "Page settings". This button gives you access to several options that may be of use. Low-vision users can alter the scale of the website. You can also choose between the full desktop version of the site or the one designed for mobile phones and tablets. There are occasions where the full site is better, and times when the lack of clutter offered by the mobile version of a site is preferable. Another significant option is called The Reader. This is a mode that simplifies a website for easier reading, removing any clutter. For instance, on a site with an article, it will make it easier to read the article by removing ads, forms, and other cluttering elements. When done reading, hit the button again to deactivate the reader and regain access to all elements of a site. This is a very useful tool, particularly while you're still mastering VoiceOver.
The Bottom Navigation Bar:
This strip across the bottom of the screen has five buttons. From left to right, they are Back, Forward, Share, Show Bookmarks, and TABS. The Back and Forward buttons are used to flip through recently browsed pages you've opened in the same tab. Perhaps, you've started at a search engine and moved onto a page that was the result of your search. You could then use the Back button to go back to the search page to go to another result.
    The Share button lets you share contents found on the web with others or with other apps able to use the content. This lets you email links to friends or tweet links to articles, for example. Double tap the Share button to bring up the "share sheet", which has a wide array of options to facilitate this. Be certain to double tap on the More button in the share sheet if you don't find the option you want on the initial sheet. The More button is where you find most options related to sharing content using other apps rather than to specific contacts.
    The Show Bookmarks button brings up sites you have bookmarked, as well as preinstalled bookmarks. Double tapping on a bookmark takes you to that site. One included bookmark is the user guide for your device, available as a web page. You can also obtain the guide in Apple Books if you're more comfortable reading it in that app. In Safari, use the Back and Forward buttons to help navigate the guide.
    The Tabs button lets you switch between sights you have opened in separate tabs. You can have as many tabs open as you like. You may want to do this to shop for a product on one site while reading reviews about it elsewhere on the web. However, to move between tabs, you need to use the Tabs button in the bottom-right corner. This opens up a tab management window. This is where you can switch between tabs, close unwanted tabs, and open new tabs for additional sites to be at the ready. If you double tap and hold the Tabs button, an option will come up allowing you to close all currently open tabs. Flicking right will present other possibilities in the area of tab management.
    As of iOS 15, it is now possible to have entire groups of tabs. Perhaps, you're researching a product and want to have several sites handy to refer to. You can do this by creating a tab group containing any sites relevant to what you're researching. When you're finished with that group of tabs, you can simply get rid of the whole group at once.
Browsing a Site:
As of iOS, 15, the navigation bar and search field are together at the bottom or top of the screen at your choosing. The rest of the screen will be filled with the contents of the website you're currently focussed on. Flick through the contents with left and right flicks. You can also feel around and get a sense of where things are on the page. Both of these methods are helpful at times, but would be tediously cumbersome and slow if used exclusively. By far, the best way to navigate is through use of the rotor. You can turn the rotor to settings for Headings, Links, Form Controls, etc., and then flick up and down to quickly get to the next or previous instance of what the rotor is set to. Flicking left or right will still move you by character, word, or line, allowing for easy reading of text on a website. The Rows setting is useful when dealing with tables. While in a table, set the rotor to rows and flick up or down to move to the previous and next row without changing the column you're in. Flicking left or right moves you between columns. In the VoiceOver settings, you can add or remove things from the rotor so that it best suits your style of navigation. Many VoiceOver settings have an effect on the web browsing experience.
Form Controls:
To use a "form control", double tap on it to let VoiceOver know to focus on that control. You can then type information or alter the value of combo boxes or sliders, check or uncheck boxes, etc. Simply flicking right or touching the screen outside the form controls will get you out of the edit mode. There's usually a button called Submit, OK, or Done that should be double tapped to complete the use of form controls when finished filling out a form. Often, hitting the Go or Return key will have this effect. Most form controls are read in such a way that you know what information a field requires or what a control such as a combo box, slider, or checkbox pertains to without leaving the mode where the focus is. However, touching outside the form will sometimes be helpful in determining this.
The Download Manager:
Rather than always downloading files into specific apps, you can also now simply download files to a folder on your iOS device or in iCloud for later use. You can do this without having to use the share sheet and finding the Save to Files option. This process got a lot easier in iOS 13 thanks to the download manager added to Safari. For people like me who take full advantage of digital goods, this is fantastic. I can now download ebooks I purchase directly into my iCloud for safekeeping and then move them to files or open them into apps later. Unfortunately, the download manager doesn't always activate, since whatever you try to download may not be recognized as a file. I've had this happen with some PDF files. In that case, they typically open in the browser itself. I merely have to use the "share" button in the navigation bar at the bottom. This presents options which let me direct the file to the appropriate area of iCloud or app I want the file to be used in.
    For our purpose, we'll use a video created by Apple to demonstrate the accessibility features built into its products. The video is around 90 MB in size and plays for around a minute. If you have the setting for audio description turned on, all the action will be described. It's a pretty powerful minute and well worth listening to. To find this video, go to www.apple.com/accessibility.
    Next, browse the page and find the heading that reads: "Technology is Most Powerful When It Empowers Everyone." Directly beneath this heading, you'll find a button labelled Play the Accessibility Overview Film. Normally, you would simply double tap on this to stream the video. However, let's say you want to show it to a friend of yours who lives in a cabin in the woods. There's no Internet access out there, so you'll have to bring the video to your friend on your device. By default, files will be downloaded into a Downloads' folder created automatically on your iCloud drive. You can access this folder in the Files app. However, we need to change that location to get the video onto your device. This is done in the Settings app. Go into the Safari section of settings and over to Downloads. It will most likely say Downloads iCloud Drive. Double tap this and flick right until you reach On My iPhone or whatever your device is. Double tap this. There's much more to be found in Safari settings, and we'll be back there later in this section for a longer stay.
    For now, though, go back into Safari. Instead of double tapping on the video, do a single finger triple tap. This brings up the "context menu". A handy thing to do in all kinds of places. Flick right through the options until you get to Download Linked File and double tap this. A new icon will appear by the address bar showing the progress of the download. Once it has completed, this icon will simply say "Downloads". You can now go into the Files app and browse in the On My iPhone or appropriate device name. Expand that location by double tapping on it and then flick right to explore the contents. You'll find the video waiting for you there. Now, you can play it even without an Internet connection.
    For most circumstances, having your files download to your iCloud Drive will serve just as well. However, if you only have 5 GB of iCloud space, you may prefer to have files go directly onto your device. In that case, I suggest creating a new folder for such downloads on your device and then making it the default download location in Safari settings.
Safari Settings
Safari has many settings that are divided into groups using headings. Turn the rotor to Headings, and you can quickly flick up or down between groups of settings to get to what you want to change. We won't cover these settings exhaustively. However, we'll touch on any that can be especially helpful to blind people. For a more complete discussion, please refer to the user guide for your specific device.
Search Settings
A lot of what people do on the Internet involves searching. The very first setting under this group is a pretty easy one to comprehend. It lets you choose your search engine. The default is Google. It has certainly done well by me. However, there are other options. Double tapping on this setting will let you select a different default engine for your inquiries. The next two settings let you turn on or off automatic suggestions from your search engine and Safari itself.
    The Quick Website Search lets you type in a short name of a website into the navigation bar, followed by the term or terms you wish to search a particular site for. This may prove convenient. Personally, I just go to whatever site I need information from and search there.
    The Preload Top Hit setting would cause any site that came up first in a search to automatically load and be shown. This would save you clicking on that link to visit that particular result. Just keep in mind that the top result isn't always the best result for you. It can often pay to look at other results before leaping.
General Safari Settings:
This group contains around five settings. They begin with Autofill, which is the ability to have login information such as passwords and account names automatically filled in for you once you verify who you are. For example, instead of typing in your email and a long password, you could simply double tap an option that appears when a site loads that says, "use Michael Feir" or whatever your account name happens to be. Double tapping on this will then prompt your device to ask you to look at it if using Face ID, or touch the Home button if using Touch ID. You could also use a passcode. The information would be filled in, and you would then simply double tap on the Sign-In button or whatever the name of it is on that particular site.
    The Frequently Visited Sites setting will keep track of the sites you visit often. Instead of having to type their name in the navigation bar, you could find and double tap the site in a list that pops up when you activate the navigation bar. This can save many taps over the course of a day.
    The Block Popups setting does what its name suggests. Many sites feature content including ads that pop up and eclipse the actual site. This option keeps that from happening. This is preferable most of the time. However, there are instances when a good thing such as a checkout window letting you pay for content or a video you want to see is supposed to pop up. In such cases, you can exclude sites from being blocked. This, therefore, isn't an all-or-nothing choice.
    Another key setting in this area lets you set where content you download from the Internet gets stored. It defaults to a directory in iCloud Drive. However, you can change this if you wish. You can also change when or if files you download are removed from the list of recently downloaded files. The default is set for one day after you download them.
Tabs:
These settings allow you to configure what Safari does regarding tabs. A tab is a place containing an open website. You may want to have several tabs open for sites you visit frequently. Alternatively, you might just use one tab and forget about others you've left open. These settings in this group let you choose to open sites in the same tab you're already in, or open a new tab when a link leads to a new site. You can decide when you want tabs to close, or else take care of that yourself. Settings in this area are very straightforward.
Privacy and Security:
These settings can help make your explorations online safer. The first setting lets you prevent websites from tracking you after you leave. The next lets you decide to block all cookies. Cookies are tiny files that sites save to your device to keep track of things. Not all cookies are harmful. Some will speed up things like online shopping or keep track of frequently entered information. However, others will allow advertisers to target you with ads about various products and services. Usually, websites will explain what they do with cookies, so you can decide whether your interests are served. As with popups, the Block All Cookies isn't an all-or-nothing choice. You can have exceptions either way.
    Another nice addition is a Fraudulent Website Warning. This will alert you to sites that may be unsafe. You can still visit them, but this will at least warn you if it's a known bad site.
    The Check for APPLE Pay setting will let websites know that you have Apple Pay. You can then use this convenient and secure method of payment if you wish. This can speed up online shopping.
    Another setting lets you clear your website data and history, which gets rid of any cookies or other data stored on your device. Every so often, this can help get around technical difficulties with some sites.
Settings for Websites:
The settings here will change what happens when you visit sites. For low-vision users, the Page Zoom setting may be useful. Another very useful setting is Request Desktop Website. This setting will force any sites you visit to display their full version designed for desktops. These can be much more cluttered than the mobile-friendly versions of sites. However, they frequently contain options that the more stripped down, clutter-free sites lack. One example of this is when returning books you purchase at Audible. I can't do that on the mobile site and need to go to the full desktop site.
    The Reader is a feature of Safari that is designed to declutter a busy website, making the text content easier to read. This setting lets you choose to use the reader automatically on all sites that you visit. I wouldn't recommend this, as some interactive forms and elements you might need may be hidden. However, beginners may find it helpful in exploring various sites.
    The Camera, Microphone, and Location settings let you decide whether sites can make use of these capabilities or not. On a social chatting site, you would likely want to be able to use the microphone and camera. Other times, you might want to make certain these capabilities can't be used. These three buttons let you take control of this.
    A number of these settings can also be found using the "page settings" button in the Safari browser. While the equivalent ones found here operate on a global basis, the "page settings" button lets you set them for specific sites if you require a different approach for certain pages.
Reading List:
These settings let you save any items added to the Safari Reading List automatically to your device, so you can view the content offline. It can be helpful if you want to stock up on articles or other information for reading when you'll be off the grid.
    At the very end of this group is a button called advanced. I've never had occasion to use anything in here before writing this section in late 2019. In there, you can manage any website data. You can also choose whether to let Java run. Java is a frequently used Internet language, letting sites run useful applications. Don't disable this unless you have a good reason. These really are settings most people won't need. A lot of this is clearly for developers. At this point, I'll simply refer you to the user guide and Google and get out of here before doing anything daft.
Further Thoughts on Mobile Web Browsing:
Sitting on my couch listening to an afternoon talk show, I was told of a rather important survey. It concerned the rather heavy subject of the right to medically assisted dying. This is a new legal and ethical territory in my country, Canada, and we're still struggling with it. The government put up a survey online to get an idea where the opinions of average Canadians stood on this issue. As soon as they mentioned the URL or web address of the survey, I went there to check it out. Feeling uncertain what I thought of assisted dying, I didn't feel I had anything to contribute. However, I could have done so easily had that not been the case. Had I wanted to, I could also have used Google or other search engines to become far better informed about the subject before filling out the survey. The amount of information available freely on the web is positively overwhelming.
    Through the use of the Safari browser, I have done a great many things. I've donated to charity during a critical time when my donation would be doubled by a philanthropic agency. Hearing about a product while in someone's car, I was able to look up reviews about it and determine that it wasn't something I should get. I've learned about the plots of movies. More than one friendly bet has been settled through use of the Safari browser in my iPhone.
    While apps are often the better way to access online things using your iOS device, there are plenty of occasions when the website is more accessible and, therefore, preferable to the app. I tend to use the Amazon site and Safari rather than the Amazon app, mainly because the app doesn't support purchasing Kindle books. Those are by far my most frequent kinds of online purchases.
    Apple is constantly updating Safari to keep up with changes happening on the web. Security gets improved. New capabilities such as using Face ID to log into various sites or pay for online purchases via Apple Pay are added regularly. Nearly every update to iOS improves Safari in some way. Many settings in VoiceOver deal with navigating the web, and Apple does a lot to make certain that VoiceOver and Safari work well together. I would strongly encourage people to check for any developments to Safari and VoiceOver settings, particularly after a major iOS update.
    To really get the hang of mobile browsing, there's no substitute for practice. Try visiting the next website you hear about on the news or in conversation. See what your government offers in terms of accessible services. There are organizations dedicated to helping blind people or offering accessible goods and services. Try browsing any of their websites. Have some fun out there on the web. To make certain everyone has a good place to start surfing the web, the next section of this guide is dedicated to giving you a tour of one of the most helpful places for beginners to know about. Come along as I show you around AppleVis.

The AppleVis Grand Tour:
For blind people who own Apple products, there is a steeper learning curve finding out how to use them competently. That difficulty is further compounded when we go looking for accessible apps. Finding which apps are actually accessible using VoiceOver out of the millions available is a harder and often discouraging experience. Apple itself provides almost no guidance in either of these areas that newcomers are at all likely to be aware of.
    Out of these conditions, the AppleVis website and online community were founded, as blind early adopters wanted to share their excitement and experience. Over the years, AppleVis has become the central hub where helpful information and friendly, knowledgeable advice can be found.
    We came within a hair's breadth of losing this precious resource. In charge of all the technology related aspects of the site was one individual. David Goodwin had created the Applevis site and single-handedly dealt with all of the ins and outs of maintaining and improving things. Other volunteers helped with moderating and other tasks, but the buck stopped with David. He kept everything going for over a decade, never being out of reach. When he faced some illness, he decided to step back from this role.
    The site was placed in a static mode while options were explored to keep the site afloat. Thankfully, due to the massive outcry from people who drew great value from the Applevis community and resource, the Be My Eyes company stepped forward. It took over technical and financial responsibility for keeping the Applevis community going and maintaining things. The volunteers continue to play a crucial role, and there are two paid staff positions to keep things in hand and help with any changes desired by the community. I'm ever so thankful that Applevis was saved in this way.
    Created in 2010, this site has grown tremendously over the past decade. I was fortunate to have this resource to turn to when I began my journey with iOS. I hope that all of my readers choose to share in its many benefits during their own journeys. The preceding section dealt with browsing the web. It seems proper to point people towards a resource that is free to use and suitable to practice your web browsing skills upon. We'll start with a brief overview of what the AppleVis community has to offer, as well as some of its history. Thereafter, we'll delve more deeply into various aspects of the website and community of helpful, friendly users that all of us are invited to be a constructive part of. Keep in mind here that I won't spend time telling you how to do things like post messages. I'll describe what's there and leave it to you to figure things out. The AppleVis site is one of the best and safest places online for new blind users to explore and experiment for themselves.
    I first began to drop in on the AppleVis site in late 2010. More stories about these iPhones that could talk and the apps being made for them kept coming up in my online socializing. I found it hard to believe blind people could do so much with something having no physical keys. The AppleVis site kept being mentioned in these stories and conversations with other people, so I visited the site to learn more.
    Reading the various discussions and guides available at the time was certainly fascinating. However, what really pulled me in was the sense of overall community. I've always admired initiatives that freely offered help to all. I found a real sense of shared discovery and excitement. People wanted to share what they were learning how to do with their iPhones. News was spread quickly about apps that were found to be accessible to blind people. I was really attracted to the thriving discussion forum as well as the quickly growing app directory.
    The AppleVis podcast feed features contributions from community members as well as from the people in charge of AppleVis. The staff do AppleVis Extra and AppleVis Unleashed podcasts every month. People will find countless demonstrations of various apps, so they can hear how they sound and what they're like to use.
    To keep the community going strong, the staff often starts discussion topics or holds special events. These can be a lot of fun to participate in or simply keep tabs on as they unfold. These include polls, awards for particularly accessible or popular apps, birthday celebrations, and more. Furthermore, whenever an operating system update happens, the AppleVis staff check it for any accessibility implications and put up a report rapidly to inform the community of issues and positive improvements they find. I always check for this before I update my iPhone.
    All of this is kept thriving and orderly by a small group of volunteers who manage the community and site. For the first ten plus years of its existence, nobody got paid for what they did. To help pay for upkeep costs, donations were requested, but never mandatory. People never needed to donate to make use of the site. I was a proud member of the Applevis Club of contributors. Now that the Be My Eyes company has stepped forward, there is no longer a need for average users to donate financially. The site is on a far more stable footing now.
The AppleVis Home Page:
The AppleVis community is pretty lively, and the constantly changing website reflects that. New apps are discovered frequently and added to the app directories. New conversations are started, and old ones renewed as opinions and circumstances change. Think of the AppleVis home page as your free and constantly refreshed newspaper. People can easily find out what's new at AppleVis merely by browsing the information beneath the heading that interests them. Diving deeper into a conversation or an app directory entry is no more than a few swipes and a double tap away. Headings such as Latest Posts and Updates, Trending Posts, Latest App Recommendations, etc., keep people oriented. Simply turn your rotor to Headings and quickly flick up or down through the blocks of content.
    When you first go to this homepage, it will be freshly formed. However, this doesn't automatically happen if you attend to other things and have left the page open in a browser tab. If the contents seem to be the same, and it's been more than an hour, find the "Applevis" banner and link at the top of the page and double tap this. Doing so will force the page to refresh, and you'll be certain that you have the newest content displayed. You might notice that a conversation which was further down the page has moved up, which indicates at least one fresh contribution has been made. A new app review or directory entry may have been added. It's always good to use the link in that Applevis banner to be certain you're dealing with the most current happenings.
    For beginners, there is a whole dedicated section with guides and tutorials. These are either text or audio and can be very helpful if you're still learning how to do the basics. The heading is the next one down from the Welcome Section. Beneath the heading, you'll find links to material for each kind of Apple product. Double tap on the link that applies to you, and then explore that page for useful material.
    Below this section, you'll come to the Latest Posts and Updates heading. Right beneath this heading, you'll find a filter option that lets you focus in on specific kinds of updates. Otherwise, you'll find all the latest postings to the site awaiting you. Each is marked as a heading, so you can easily flick down through them in order. The headings are also links, so if you find something you're interested in finding out about, double tap, and you'll be taken there. When you're finished with that entry, use the Back button at the bottom left of the screen to return to the home page. At the bottom of this list, you'll find a View Older Posts heading that also happens to be a link that you can double tap to dig deeper into the past.
    The next heading below is Trending Posts. Things aren't quite given as much prominence below this point on the home page. Each conversation is marked by a link that you can double tap. This section is good for catching older conversations that have become reenergized.
    Lower down, the next heading is one of my personal favourites. It's called Latest App Recommendations. Under that heading, you'll find links to the latest apps recommended by the AppleVis community. Always worth a quick looking over. Double tap on a link to be taken directly to the appropriate entry in the app directory.
    Farther down the page, you'll find more headings. These include one for the latest accessibility ratings done by the community.
The App Directories:
The app directories are repositories of information about apps that have been tried by AppleVis staff and community members. Blind people hoping to find accessible software for their Apple products will find them a tremendously valuable resource. For readers of this guide, we will be focusing on the iOS directory.
    Essentially, the directory is a constantly growing collection of entries that each describe an app. They also allow comments to be made by community users, so they serve as a place where conversation about that app occurs as time passes. They are more structured than blog postings. Think of them more like database entries. They must contain information such as an app's description and category, how accessible or inaccessible an app is, the developer's name, and any contact information. You'll also find out the iOS version and equipment the app was tested on so that you can put any comments into proper context.
    Below an entry are any comments contributed by community members. This allows for people to disagree with information in the entry or offer their experiences with the app. App developers are not allowed to post initial entries about their own apps in the app directory. However, they are free and encouraged to post comments. Quite often, they will introduce themselves and their apps in forum discussions. This is to make certain that what people learn about is how community members experience an app, rather than what an app developer wants people to think. You need to be a community member to post an entry to an app directory. Some entries from unregistered users are permitted, but only after being manually checked by AppleVis staff. This is to prevent any kind of misuse of the app directory and makes certain there's accountability.
    There are many ways to explore the app directories of AppleVis. It is possible to search for app names specifically if people know them. Also, you can browse by particular category such as game, productivity, reference, etc. Apps can be sorted in several ways, such as by title, date of entry, date of last comment about an entry, and many more ways. This lets people drill down to the kind of app they need and find out about what people who have tried the app have experienced.
    If people disagree with what an entry says about an app, they are encouraged to add to the comments below the app entry and make their feelings known. AppleVis staff will edit entries when appropriate. Original posters of app entries can also edit them. Change is certainly possible and happens fairly frequently as apps are improved, or age without such improvement and become less workable.
    Suppose you want to find a good, accessible app for writing. You would go to the main menu of AppleVis and choose Apps. You'd then be on the main app directory page. Furthermore, you default to the iOS app directory. Additionally, you'd then decide to view the Productivity category. Sorting the entries can help minimize what you have to look through, which helps when there are potentially hundreds of apps in a category. By default, apps are sorted in ascending order by title. I don't find this useful. Instead, I use the sorting form to sort by the date an app was last commented on and select descending order. This puts the apps most recently discussed at the top. Entries have headings, so I turn the rotor to Headings and flick down through the titles. Scrivener and Pages have recently been commented on and sound promising. I can double tap on an app title to focus on its particular entry rather than the summary displayed under the heading. I can then always use the Back button in my browser to go back to the list and can begin looking at alternatives.
    Think of the app directories as where the more formal conclusions of the community about an app are stored. It's a good record of the last time an app was investigated seriously. To prevent abuse, there are understandable safeguards against anybody being able to simply change an app's entry. The forums are where more ongoing and informal discussion takes place. This helps to balance out problems with the app directory approach. If an app isn't being actively commented on in the app directory, you may find out about updates or changes that have taken place since the entry was last modified. Forum discussions often dig deeper into people's experiences with an app. For instance, I might ask in a forum posting whether people have had trouble entering an apostrophe while using Scrivener. I have yet to read of anybody having that issue, but it kept me looking for different apps until I found Ulysses. Frequently, app developers start or participate in forum discussions about their apps. This helps issues get resolved faster.
    On the main apps page, you'll find links that take you to collections of apps specifically designed for blind people. Due to how the app entries are constructed, you need never worry that what you'll find there will be outdated. The pages are generated on demand. This is useful, as it provides a very safe group of apps for beginners to start their experience with.
    I gained a lot from the app directory while I was new to the iOS ecosystem. For one thing, it helped me steer clear of apps that weren't accessible. I very much appreciated that. Also, it allowed me to learn from a blind user's perspective about apps I was considering. This let me make much better choices early on until I became skilled with VoiceOver. The mainly positive early experience I had was thanks largely to the AppleVis site and the app directory.
The Discussion Forum:
The real heart of the whole AppleVis endeavour are the ever-expanding discussion forums. This is the place where community members come together. People ask for help, offer advice, and share their most recent discoveries. Membership is free and anyone can participate.
    When I first looked through the AppleVis site, I found the heading called Latest Posts and Updates. This showed me the most recently active topics of discussion in the forums. I had participated in online communities before, so I realized immediately that this was just the tip of a large iceberg. There are many forums devoted to major categories of discussion, such as iOS gaming. Within each forum, there are hundreds of discussion topics that potentially have hundreds or thousands of messages. It boggles the mind thinking about how much writing is in there. These discussions stretch back to the very beginning of AppleVis nearly a decade ago. All of it is searchable by anyone.
    To get to the forums, find the Main Menu link near the top of the AppleVis site and activate it. This will reveal a menu of links, letting you easily navigate to different areas of AppleVis. Find and activate the Forum link in the menu. Once at the forum page, you'll find everything laid out on a table. Set your rotor to Links or Rows, and you can easily flick up or down to look at each of the forums. The first column shows whether there are any new postings. Next, you'll find the name of the forum and the number of posts. The forum names are links, so you can double tap on them to enter that forum. Next, you can browse through the topics within a forum. Each topic is a link, so double tapping on it will let you drill down into that particular discussion. It's all done consistently with links and is straightforward to get around. Remember to check for multiple pages. There will be links to get you to those. You'll find multiple pages of topics in every forum, and most discussion threads have multiple pages. Conversation threads can be long and sprawling things, but postings will generally be on topic.
    Anybody can participate in the discussions.
    However, before doing so, people need to register with AppleVis and create an account. Once you have an account and are logged in, you can post messages in the forums. AppleVis reserves the right to delete inappropriate content and takes measures to keep things informative and free from abuse. Be polite, and you should do fine in the community. Try not to post messages that aren't substantive. They just create more work for the staff. Don't worry about having your head bitten off while you're learning the ropes. People are largely supportive and helpful to newcomers.
    Writing messages is easy to do. Everything is very accessible, and the message form is easy to write in. Edit fields for subject and message are all clearly labelled and work wonderfully with VoiceOver. There are formatting tools as well that people can use if they wish. When you're finished writing your message, find and double tap on the Save button to post the message.
    Things tend to be quite friendly and calm in the forums most of the time. People try to help each other out and love to share new techniques or news about apps they have discovered to be accessible. Developers of apps have found the community to be helpful and friendly when they seek help making their apps more accessible. However, like any large community, there are flashpoints and arguments. These tend to settle down reasonably quickly and are contained within the threads that the argument starts in. I have yet to see hostility spread beyond a single thread to more widespread trouble. Keep in mind that there are people of all ages participating with varying degrees of life experience. Also, unless one has actually created an app, it can be hard to really have a sense of the effort required. App store economics can be very tight on developers trying to make a living. To varying degrees, members of the AppleVis community are all aware of the plethora of apps and games available to sighted users and want access to the same or similar things. Most of the time, I've found that yearning to be at the root of discontent. This can get especially heated when it seems like an app or game could be made accessible but isn't.
    There are guidelines and help for people who wish to participate in the forums. In the main menu, keep flicking right past the Forum option, and you'll eventually get to one called Help. Double tap on this, and you'll find a lot of frequently asked questions. These include several related to the forums, including guidelines for posting to forums. Double tap on a question and then flick right to read the answer, which has expanded when you double tapped the question. The help is quite extensive, but you should feel free to contact the AppleVis staff if you're unclear about things.
    To keep the community as a whole informed about forum discussions, the latest trending topics are posted on the AppleVis home page. Trending topics are also posted to social media such as Twitter. People can follow AppleVis and will receive updates via X. This makes certain that anybody who might have something to say about a topic can do so.
    My experience in the AppleVis forums has been overwhelmingly a positive one. I've been part of many discussions about accessible games and all kinds of other apps. I remember how thrilled I was when I learned about the BlindSquare GPS app when it came out. There was so much excitement around that as people began using it, reporting what they learned about their real-world surroundings. The KNFB Reader app made a tremendous buzz as a group of early adopters tried to convince the rest of us that it was worth the high price compared to other apps. More recently, the Voice Dream Scanner app caused quite a commotion, bringing excellent character recognition to everyone for the price of about two cups of coffee. It's always fun reading people's joyful remarks when they learn about newly discovered accessible apps or techniques for accomplishing something with VoiceOver. There have also been occasions when I've been able to recommend apps that have helped people in their lives. For me, that is the ultimate pleasure and privilege. Another neat thing that happens quite often is when a thread starts off with a bitter complaint. There was one that criticized the currently available accessible games. I cringed at the thought of app developers reading the initial message about how simple games sucked and how this person wanted games on a par with what sighted people were playing. To some extent, I think a good many of us share this fellow's frustration. However, the disparaging, angry way it was expressed made me cringe at the thought of it being what someone who didn't have any contextual awareness stumbled upon. Over time, the discussion sparked by this outburst became a far more mature and thoughtful examination of where we are in that area. There's such a broad base of experience that people who come in complaining and frustrated tend to find answers that clear away their issues or at least raise their level of understanding about the difficulties in solving them. Overall, I love how a positive spirit nearly always prevails in the forums.
A Place for Beginners:
To help new owners of Apple products get their bearings, the staff at AppleVis have created a section of their site that collects helpful guides and resources. These tend to be about individual things people might wonder how to do, rather than a more complete guide like what you're reading now. For many people, this approach will be precisely what the doctor ordered, and will get you experimenting with your device quickly. On the AppleVis site, look for a heading that says Getting Started With Your First Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch, Or Apple Watch. Beneath that heading, you'll find both written guides as well as audio tutorials. They tend to be relatively short and focused. This section is added to as new developments in Apple's operating systems occur. Keep in mind that all of this is done by volunteers rather than paid experts. Please keep your expectations reasonable here. Not everyone is brilliant at recording or writing. However, all the contributions found here were made by knowledgeable people who took time out of their lives to lessen the learning curve for others. I, for one, appreciate this helpful spirit.
AppleVis Podcasts:
Often, it can be very useful to have someone describe how to do something while he or she is actually doing it. This lets people get an idea of how things should sound if done successfully. Reading about an app doesn't always give you a good enough idea of how suitable or interesting it would be for you. To help with this, AppleVis staff and members of the community record audio demos and tutorials. These are published to the AppleVis site as well as to the AppleVis podcast feed. You can type "AppleVis" into your podcast app of choice and automatically receive notifications or actual podcasts as they are posted.
    The AppleVis staff do at least two podcasts regularly. These are the AppleVis Extra and AppleVis Unleashed podcasts. They are posted every month. People will also find many demonstrations of various apps posted by AppleVis community members. One podcast might be a review of a game. The next might be a step-by-step guide on how to use a feature such as Voice Control. For Club AppleVis members, a special podcast feed contains all materials posted since the very beginning of AppleVis. As many apps still survive to this day from that time, this can be handy every so often.
Community Special Events and Initiatives:
Often, the staff of AppleVis puts on special events to keep things active in the community and tap into the tremendous resource of users to advocate for increased accessibility. These events can take many forms. Often, discussions are started in the blog by staff members to spur comment from users. Often, there are voting polls about various things. The most exciting of these are when the Golden Apple awards are handed out each year to apps that are especially accessible and popular. Birthday celebrations and giveaways frequently occur when the anniversary of AppleVis comes around. Still more interaction is likely to occur as word spreads about this community. The AppleVis staff are constantly looking for new ways to increase community participation and fun.
    Any operating system updates released by Apple are occasions when you'll definitely want to drop into the AppleVis site. Whenever an operating system update happens, the AppleVis staff check it for any accessibility implications and put up a report rapidly to inform the community of issues and positive improvements they find. I always check for this before I update my iPhone to be certain that no major accessibility upsets are introduced that I can't cope with. The staff are few but very knowledgeable and heavy users of Apple products. They will certainly catch anything major. They don't always catch all the changes introduced. For that kind of thoroughness, wait and watch for comments to appear below the official posting from AppleVis. There are invariably pioneers among community members, myself included, who plunge in and report about any positive improvements or trouble spots they encounter.
The Main Menu:
Don't forget to make use of that Main Menu button. Double tap it and flick right over the options. You'll first find a Submit Content option, letting you do precisely that. Blog entries, forum postings, app reviews, hardware reviews, and much more can be submitted by community members. I hope that some of you will take the time to create an account and contribute your discoveries and expertise to the community. If it weren't for this helpful resource, you wouldn't be reading this guide. If it weren't for people stepping up and volunteering their time and talent, AppleVis would never have lasted.
    Other options will transport you to different areas of the site. For instance, there's an option to get to the podcasts, so you can access what's on offer right from the site rather than using a podcast app. Another option will take you to the blog, where you'll find out about any initiatives or discover new postings for discussion. There is also an option to take you to the app directories. For people needing accessories known to be accessible, there's a Hardware Accessories option, taking you to a growing collection of reviews.
You Can Help:
There are all sorts of ways to pitch in and make AppleVis an even better resource. Your participation in forum discussions is one key way. Ask those questions you have about how to do things, or what the best app for your purposes might be. We were all beginners once. Most often, someone will come up with some sort of answer in a reasonable period of time. I've rarely waited over half a day before answers have begun to appear when I've asked about things. Write a review about an app you've discovered or add your comments about an app already reviewed. They may prove helpful to others. Participate in polls, votes, and other community events. Your opinions count and help keep the site fresh and lively. Regardless of whether you feel comfortable expressing yourself, I fervently hope that you'll tap into the extensive resources and thriving community that is AppleVis. For blind users of Apple products, it is a vital resource.

Adding Capabilities with The App Store:
We've now reached an important milestone in your iPhone journey. So far, you've learned how to control your iPhone. Once that was mastered, we went onto learning about apps which come preinstalled on your iPhone. All of these have been made by Apple. They have been designed to incorporate accessibility features like VoiceOver to the maximum extent possible. The experience you've had with your iPhone has been as free from bugs and accessibility issues as possible. However, you might have found that in a quest to keep things simple, Apple has perhaps omitted capabilities that you wish that the apps on your iPhone had. Now, you are ready to engage with a much wider possibility space.
    If you wish you could do X on your iOS device, chances are good that "there's an app for that". You've almost certainly heard that sentence before. An "app", short for "application", is a piece of software that allows you to use your iOS device to do something. There are likely over a million apps and games available for that simple flat object you hold in your hands. I'm writing this guide on one such app called Ulysses. There are apps to help keep you organized, read books, navigate around your area, and infinitely more possibilities.
    More than likely, there are many different apps that do something you want to accomplish. You can learn about and select the app that best suits your skill level and circumstances. This gives you a kind of control over where you want complexity versus simplicity. For example, Apple includes a word processor called Pages free of charge for anybody who owns a modern iOS device. While I could have used it to write this guide, I didn't like how it approached writing or its lack of an easy way to spellcheck documents accessibly at the time I began this project. It has since improved in terms of accessible practicality quite markedly, so I would urge people to try this freely provided option before looking farther afield. I searched for and found many different word-processing apps and chose the one I currently use instead. These explorations had a financial cost and left me with numerous writing apps. That will certainly happen to you in areas of special interest as you pursue that perfect app for your specific needs.
    When you want to see if an app that you own has been updated or want to find and acquire a new app, the "app store" is where you'll want to go. All apps are sold or offered freely in that venue. You'll find it on your home screen. Simply double tap on the App Store app to enter the store.
    Before we go further, be aware that not all apps are available in all countries. I live in Canada, and there may be some apps that I reference that you cannot find or obtain. The same applies to me. Being in Canada, there are apps in the US and other countries app stores that are unavailable to Canadians. Thankfully, most apps aren't restricted in this fashion. Another thing to note is that depending on restrictions placed on purchases by whoever owns your device, it's possible that you won't be able to obtain in-app purchases or subscriptions without permission of the device owner. For the purposes of simplicity, I'm presuming in this section that you own the device you're using and that no restrictions are placed on your activities.
    As of iOS 11, the app store has undergone a radical redesign. Apple wanted the app store to offer a more curated experience that put their knowledgeable staff and deep learning artificial intelligence to use. An editorial staff works hard to produce content such as articles about app developers and curated collections of related apps. Artificial intelligence helps customers find apps related to their interests. This matches closely with how the Apple Music service and the Podcasts app help customers find what they want in vast collections of options. This design was altered further in iOS 13 mainly to accommodate the new Apple Arcade gaming service. Sadly, I don't expect that we'll find any accessible games in the Apple Arcade. That entire tab is useless for blind people until enough accessible games are present to make it worth paying for the service.
    This section focusses on the use and navigation of the app store. I'll describe the various sections of the app store and how to navigate them. Also, I'll walk you through the process of obtaining an app, which is the same whether you need to pay money for it or not. However, I would strongly urge people to also read the subsection of The Apple Ecosystem portion of this guide called App Store Economics. There, I will go into greater depth about the financial considerations, which shape your experience with apps. Apple exerts a great deal of control over what can be offered in the app store, as well as how developers are allowed to charge you for their creations. This has implications about how motivated developers might be to maintain their apps, make them accessible if possible, and improve them over time. Tremendous change has happened in this area while I've worked on this guide, and I'll pull the curtain back, so you can better understand what happens behind the scenes.
    In this edition of the guide, I have decided to include all app recommendations in the most appropriate section of the book for the specific app. This will be substantially easier for me to maintain going forward. There's also a section earlier in this guide which gives a tour of the apps on my home screens. This should give new users plenty of safe well-designed accessible apps to start out with. For even more current app reviews and recommendations, look in the app directory and on the home page when you visit:
    www.applevis.com
    Time spent familiarizing yourself with the app store is well worth it. Hopefully, you'll be coming to the app store pretty often as you find out about more apps and check if any of the apps you previously obtained have updates.
    Let's take a full tour of this digital marketplace. Give the App Store icon a one-finger double tap. Presto! You've arrived. Welcome to where you'll digitally equip your iOS device to do your bidding. There are five tabs across the bottom of the screen. Double tap with one finger on a tab to move into the major area of the app store that the tab represents. When you first arrive in the app store after a reboot or because it's simply your first visit, you'll find yourself in the Today tab. To the right of this tab is the Games tab. Next is the Apps tab. To the right of the Apps tab is the Arcade tab. At the far right is the Search tab. Let's start our tour with a close look at each of these in detail. Once that's done, we'll cover other things such as how to purchase apps, send or receive gifts, and manage your account.
The Today Tab:
The first of the five tabs across the bottom is the Today tab. Think of it as a combination storefront and magazine about the latest apps and app developers. Apple seeks to let people know what kinds of brilliant apps and games are available that might ordinarily fall outside their areas of interest or inquiry. The problem is far more a cute for blind newcomers to iOS. However, it's a concern shared to some extent by sighted users who may not be able to imagine the tremendous possibilities offered by apps and their iOS devices. Nothing would please me more than to find a similar tab or a way to make the Today tab focus on apps that are fully accessible to blind users.
    Each day, fresh content is added to the top of the Today tab. Just a few new items per day that usually include an app, a game, and an article of interest about a developer or interesting things happening in the world of apps in general.
    You'll find the VoiceOver rotor very useful for navigating this section. Set it to Headings. The very top-left corner has a heading of the current date. Next to that, you'll find the My Account button. That's a critical button that deserves a detailed examination. We'll come back to it later in its own subsection. Subsequently, flicking right takes you to today's articles if any, plus the featured app and game of the day. You can scroll down endlessly to the contents of prior days by having the rotor set to Headings and flicking downward. If no heading is reached via a downward flick, try flicking right once and then down again. This can sometimes let new content scroll into range. Alternatively, you can perform a three-finger flick upward to scroll quickly into entries from past days. A downward three-finger flick will move you forward in time towards the present day. Flick left and right to browse through articles within a day. Double tap on what interests you. This causes either an article or app's entry page in the store to come into focus. While reading an article, you can flick downwards with two fingers to have it read the whole thing continuously. Alternatively, you can flick right to advance paragraph by paragraph. There'll always be a Dismiss Article button at the top and bottom of it. Double tap this to get out of the article.
    It can be interesting to read the articles here. Every once in a while, they might well discuss apps or games that are accessible to blind people. However, the majority of apps discussed here will be inaccessible. You may find something to tell friends about who could make use of it. If you're feeling more proactive, you might want to contact the developer of apps that seem like they could be useful to blind people if they were made accessible. Let them know about VoiceOver, AppleVis, and so forth. Be polite. You never know what might happen.
The Games Tab:
This is where you can find out about the latest games. There are thousands upon thousands of games in the app store. Sadly, the vast majority are unplayable without working eyeballs. People looking for games won't be inconvenienced by other apps. This tab focusses exclusively on games. Before, apps and games were in the same boat. This way, they each have their own territory. Flick right to advance through each item. Flick up and down to get to various headings marking sections of the tab. There are constantly updated charts of the top paid and free games, as well as information about notable updates and in-app purchases on offer. It's a very busy tab. Most games have videos available. However, the sound will be muted if VoiceOver is active, unless you find and double tap the place near the top left where it says, "Tap to Unmute".
    There are an unbelievable number of games. This tab focusses on current content and content of exceptional quality. Sadly, the vast majority will be inaccessible for blind players. People with some vision may find some games of interest depending on their abilities, but I can't recommend this as a good way to learn about accessible games for totally blind people. That said, it's a handy way to find out about current games to tell sighted friends and family about. If you start at the bottom and work left, you can find Redeem Gift and Send Gift buttons.
    As awareness of potential blind and disabled customers grows, I'm hopeful that browsing this tab for something new to play might offer higher chances of finding something enjoyable for blind people.
The Apps Tab:
Almost exactly like the Games tab in layout and functionality, the Apps tab focusses on apps that aren't games. As before, there are top charts, featured apps, and other major sections that can be navigated between via the rotor set to Headings. Here, I think there's more of a chance to come across something useful to blind people. It's more likely with apps where the focus isn't quite as purely visual. Many banks have made their apps accessible. Other task-related things like writing apps, calendars, etc., have also been made accessible. There's still markedly less awareness with game developers that there are potential blind players out there. You wouldn't believe the number of people I've run into over my life who are flat out amazed that we can use computers with actual physical keyboards. Some of them have been so ignorant as to be thunderstruck that I can know where my mouth was and actually direct food into it at the end of a fork. I wish I was joking there, but I'm not.
    Thanks to advocacy and regulations, there's a higher chance that practical apps provided by companies and institutions serving the greater public will be made in an accessible fashion. My bank has an app available for its customers that is fully accessible to me. To keep on track, I now use the Calendar and Reminders apps, which are included in iOS by Apple. However, it took years until Apple added features which were as good as an app called Fantastical. This app combines the functions of calendar and reminder apps into one and makes managing and planning events easier. This app started out being accidentally and only partially accessible. However, when the developer was made aware of interest in his app from the blind community, he made it fully supportive of VoiceOver and a very friendly user experience. I was a deeply grateful user of Fantastical for years. I've found many other excellent apps by checking in on the Apps tab over the years. You might just find something useful by keeping a regular watch on the contents of the Apps tab. The odds of this occurring are markedly better for regular apps as opposed to games.
    I would still urge caution. Before buying an app that sounds useful, check the app description by double tapping on the app's name and examining its page in the store. You'll find most developers will tell you if the app supports VoiceOver or is accessible to blind people if they're actually aware that it is. Also, check in on the AppleVis site at least once every week. They have reviews and entries in their app directory about apps known to be accessible or inaccessible. Apple is pretty good about refunding app purchases if the app proves inaccessible, but it's a process. Save yourself time and possibly money by learning from others.
Making Use of the Games and Apps Tabs:
Browsing is really what these tabs are all about. While the focus is on the popular and new and notable, these tabs offer more than is immediately apparent. First of all, around the headings, you'll often find See All buttons. Double-tap on those with one finger to be taken into whatever the heading says the subsection is about. You might, for example, find a longer list of new and notable apps or ones which are part of a curated collection. One such collection might be holiday-themed games. The organization of content is very similar in both tabs, changing slightly as new apps are featured. It's quite easy to navigate. In both these tabs, you can narrow down by finding the Top Categories heading and double tapping the See All button. That lets you enter a specific category of app or game that you're particularly interested in. There will always be a Back button at the top left, so you'll never get stuck, no matter how deeply you drill down.
    Going into categories can be very useful, since you can then look through a smaller fraction of similar apps to see if any interest you or are accessible. For instance, during National Novel Writing Month, they had a section in the Apps tab about writing apps. These included the Ulysses app that I am now using. There are also alternatives like Scrivener, Bear, and others. Many of these apps are actually accessible to blind people. It's a good idea to poke around every now and then to see if anything useful might appear in a category or collection that interests you. Don't worry about getting stuck. You'll always find a Back button in the top left of the screen that will get you back up from where you've drilled down. You're never stuck anywhere.
The Arcade Tab:
One of the most talked about additions to iOS 13 was the Apple Arcade subscription service. In a nutshell, this offers a growing selection of high quality, curated games to subscribers for a low monthly fee. People can play any game in the arcade provided they keep paying the subscription fee. This provides game developers with a more stable economic platform, as they receive a portion of subscription money based on how popular their games are. Apple may also invest in the game developers up front, so the end result is a higher quality game for their arcade. Unlike other games in the app store, all games found in Apple Arcade are free of advertising and don't have in-app purchases. This frees developers from the need to find ways to generate money within the game.
    Theoretically, this would make for an excellent venue for developing experiences that cater to everyone. Many accessible games have disappeared from the app store because it became too economically impractical to continue to develop and support them. Provided the game concepts appealed to a large enough group, the Apple Arcade business model could help games have a longer run. The catch is that there would need to be enough games accessible to blind people to make the subscription fee worth paying. There are over a hundred high-quality games for people with sight and average hand-eye coordination. This just about guarantees that the average person would find enough games that appealed to his or her interests to make the subscription fee worth paying.
    Over the longer term, I think there's certainly potential for accessible experiences to emerge in the Apple Arcade. A growing awareness of accessibility is spreading among game developers and players. Gamers with disabilities are beginning to make themselves heard. Many friends and families of people who have disabilities want more ways to have fun that don't leave them out. While I don't believe Apple Arcade will feature accessible content in the near term, I'll keep an ear open for any accessible games that may appear among the service's offerings.
The Search Tab:
Way over on the far right, you'll come across the SEARCH tab. As tabs go, it's both blessedly simple and absolutely vital to forging your iOS device into the modern equivalent of a Swiss army knife that it ought to become. As a blind user, you'll be using this tab a whole lot to find and obtain apps you hear about. Rather than ploughing through the other tabs, it's far more likely that you'll be listening to a podcast like AppleVis or Blind Abilities. Some guest of the week will talk about a great new game. Dice World and King of Dragon Pass spring instantly to my mind. You want the game, so you double tap the Search tab in the bottom-right corner. This brings up the search area.
    Move your finger over the top of the screen, and you'll find the search field. VoiceOver will say "app store search field. Double tap to edit". Once you do this, you will be in the search field and can type in the name of the app or as close to it, as you know. Next, double tap the Search button at the bottom right to conduct a search. Touch near the top left of the screen and flick right over the results of the search until you hear the correct entry. The most likely results to be relevant will be nearer to the top left. Double tap on any that interest you to get to that app's page in the store. There'll always be a Back button at the top left to get back to the main search screen. If, instead of typing something in, you flick right while in Edit mode, you'll come to a list of recent searches and suggestions that you can double tap if interested.
    While in editing mode, the whole screen is focused on your entry. The Search button in the bottom right should be used once you're satisfied with your entry. If you're not in the search field, you can find a heading called Trending, which shows you what other people are searching for the most at the moment. This can at times inform you of apps you didn't know about. I seldom check, but it's there if you like.
    There's nothing more to say about the Search tab. It's easy to use, nicely uncluttered, and your best means of finding apps you've heard about in other places. I tend to look on AppleVis or keep an ear on blindness-related podcasts to discover useful apps. The Search tab usually gets me to the app I'm interested in pretty quickly. It's always a good idea to double tap on the app title to make certain you're buying or downloading the right app. Nothing stops apps from having similar names. Go into the app entry and read the description until you hear something that makes you certain you've got the correct one. I try to remember the name of the app developer, which is always listed right after the app title.
The Quick Links Heading:
There's a heading called Quick Links, which is the very last heading in the Apps tab, as well as other tabs. Beneath this heading, you'll find a series of links addressing special needs, collections, and also important store policies. It's a good idea to look through the contents of these links. Double tap them to go to the area indicated. For instance, there are links explaining in-app purchases and parental controls, etc. There are also links to curated collections of "Apps with VoiceOver" and "Apps for Accessibility". Have a good look through both these collections. I wish they were updated a bit more often, but they're growing slowly and have a good selection of apps to get people started. I usually go to the Quick Links heading while in the apps tab, as that seems to offer more. Sadly, there is no Quick Links in the Games tab leading to a curated collection of accessible games. You'll find them lumped in with the "accessible apps" and "apps supporting VoiceOver" links found in the Apps tab. This is one area where I believe Apple could and should do better.
The My Account Button:
This handy little button found at the top of tabs in the app store and other apps provides you with access to your Apple account. Presuming you didn't skip any steps as you set up your iOS device, you've created an Apple account, and therefore have an account. This button takes you to where you can manage that account. It is also possible to get to the same place via the Settings app. However, the My Account button brings up a series of additional options such as sending and redeeming gifts, signing out, and getting at your purchased content if you want to get hold of an app you previously deleted. The Purchased button lets you review and re-download apps if you need to do this. You'll also find buttons to send and redeem gifts, plus a button that has your email address as its label. That gets you to your full account where you can manage and change payment methods, addresses, and other things. You can also access this from the Settings app and in other store apps like Apple Books and iTunes.
    A critical option here is called "subscriptions". App store economics are changing. Rather than a one-time fee, developers are more frequently offering subscription plans so that they can maintain their creations while keeping afloat financially. You will likely wish to subscribe to one or more apps in addition to any services offered by Apple you find attractive. The Subscriptions button takes you to where you can manage these subscriptions. For instance, you can cancel any active subscriptions. You can also change to a different subscription plan if developers or service providers make more than one plan available.
Updates for Apps:
Once you acquire an app, you are free to download and install it onto your device. However, the story doesn't quite end there. Apps receive updates over time that can improve their functionality and keep them useful as the iOS operating system on which they run changes. Some people simply elect to have updates come to their devices automatically and never bother to find out what has been changed. This leaves them potentially unaware of drastic improvements or design changes to how the apps they use function. Even if you choose to have updates download automatically, I would still recommend visiting the My Account area, where information on all the most recent updates to apps you've acquired can be found.
    At the top left of the Today tab, you'll find a My Account button. Double tap this and flick right past all the options discussed above. Alternatively, you can turn the rotor to Headings and flick down to where you'll either find a heading called Recent Updates or Available Updates. This may also be called Pending Updates if you decide to have updates download and install automatically. There will also be an Update All button before the list of pending updates that you can flick through. Double tap on that button to update everything possible. Otherwise, you can flick right to hear which apps have updates waiting. After each flick onto an app title, wait a moment, and you'll hear details of the latest changes in the update to the app. Occasionally, this brief listing doesn't include every little thing. However, it will make certain you're informed about any significant changes or improvements. Double tap on the individual Update buttons found after the description of the particular updates you want, and they'll be downloaded and installed immediately. This may be especially useful when you're not on Wi-Fi but still want certain updates right away even at the cost of cellular data.
    The only two headings you'll ever find in this tab are the Pending Updates section discussed above, and another heading called Recently Updated. Below this heading, you'll find a sequential list of every update you've received, which can scroll farther back in time endlessly. To check for new updates, pull down with three fingers while on the list of recent updates. Presuming you've scrolled upward as far as possible, you should hear part or all of the word "refreshing". The Pending Updates heading, and any new updates, will then appear at the top of the screen. Don't forget that you can also have the latest updates download automatically. That option can be found in the Settings app.
    Quite often, developers have merely fixed several bugs in their code and made other changes too small to be noticed by most users. In those cases, you'll find a short phrase where you might have hoped for something more substantial. That's such a common experience that it's regularly joked about. Many developers, such as the gleeful bunch who make the Transit app, go to the other extreme. People look forward to a laugh from them whenever they update their app. Nothing really governs what goes into update descriptions besides some sense of overall decency, which has so far prevailed. As your collection of apps grows, it's well worth dropping in and checking the "updates" area at least once a week. That way, you'll be well-informed and can be the one to clue your friends in about exciting changes.
Purchases, Subscriptions, and Gifts:
Let's get down to the nitty-gritty. Apps and other digital goods may not take up any physical space or weigh anything, but they still took labour to produce and will likely cost money. Whether they do or not, you will have to go through the same purchase procedure to obtain them. This makes certain that the person who owns, and Apple account approves the addition of a given free book, app, movie, or other digital good to his or her account. This prevents anybody from doing things like installing potentially malicious third-party apps or adding an unwanted track to your Apple Music library.
    The app store allows you to easily pay for the apps you want to give as gifts or use yourself. Once you have set up an Apple account and connected a credit card in the payment section of your account information, you merely have to double tap on the Get button if the app is free, or the button that gives the price of the app. Subsequently, you'll need to prove that you own the Apple account. This can be done by using the password associated with the Apple account. Regardless of the method you prefer, using the password will always be necessary for the first purchase you make after rebooting your device. It will also be necessary after a long period of around forty-eight hours when you haven't made any purchases. Other than those sorts of occasions, people will find it far more convenient to use Touch or Face ID, which greatly accelerates the purchasing process. You simply need to look at your device in the case of Face ID or touch the Home button on devices with Touch ID to verify you're the correct person. At this point, the purchase will occur. With Face ID, you will have to double-click the Action button on the side of your device while looking at it to complete the purchase. In normal circumstances, the app or other digital good you have purchased will download automatically into your device. In any case, even if you have set automatic downloading not to occur, a record is kept of your purchase or approval, and you will be able to download the app or other digital good when it is convenient for you to do so. You never need to purchase anything more than once, unless you lose your Apple account and cannot verify to Apple's satisfaction that you're you.
    If you're purchasing a subscription to an app or making an in-app purchase, you'll use the same method to pay as I described above. Any ongoing subscriptions can be managed in the My Account area, reached with the button given that name near the top left of the Today tab. You cannot receive a refund for any subscription or in-app purchase you have made. However, if you cancel before the end of a free trial period, you won't be charged. Also, if you cancel a subscription before when your payment is due, you won't be charged any further. Any benefits you've been paying a subscription for will simply stop being available to you when the current subscription period expires.
    Developers who charge subscriptions or offer in-app purchases must do so overtly. You will find explanations of anything on offer in the descriptions of apps in the app store.
    Through the app store, it is possible for you to both give and receive gifts. Let's say you've found a great new game that you think your friend would very much appreciate, but might not be able to afford. You can pay for and send your friend his or her own copy of the game. All he or she would then have to do would be to accept your gift. Rather than a specific app, you may also send electronic gift cards to people so that they can then use that money as they see fit.
    Redeeming gifts is also simple to do. These include digital gifts described above that others send you, as well as physical gift cards. This means that sending gifts is a little more complex. You should take your time. You can go through the form, filling in and selecting appropriate information. I don't usually bother with selecting themes. Also, you may find editing your gift's message to be a bit tricky. However, besides that, things are quite painless and easy to do with VoiceOver. Redeeming gifts is basic also. You can use the camera on your device to redeem any gift cards you might get over the holidays. The Redeem Gifts button will launch a series of instructions to help you do it. If you can't get the camera method to work, you can enter the gift code manually if necessary. Electronic gift cards typically have links to redeem them, but again, you can always cut and paste the code into the box to manually enter codes. You'll get the hang of it in no time.
Reflections on the App Store:
As an owner of one of these devices, I can say unequivocally that you do yourself a criminal disservice if you fail to take advantage of the app store and limit yourself to the small collection of apps that come installed on your device. I cringe when I hear about people who are so afraid of shopping online that they fail to even create an Apple account or get set up to make purchases. It would be like moving into a large house or apartment and then, for fear of being robbed, failing to furnish it, living in just the bathroom. It's very much worth your while to explore the app store and see if there's an app that will help you do something more easily or entertain you.
    Go into this exploration being aware that not all apps are accessible. These devices are designed primarily for people who have sight. Hence, their flat screens. The vast majority of games and other apps really require eyesight to use. However, when you're dealing with hundreds of thousands of apps, even having only ten percent of apps fully accessible still makes for something on the order of thirty thousand useable pieces of software. I'm being quite conservative with these numbers. I'm a pretty heavy computer user, but I don't believe I've ever heard of anybody owning anywhere near that many programs. I have around two to three hundred apps, with around eighty of them being accessible games.
    Due to the high likelihood of finding an inaccessible app, I always recommend that blind users try to learn about an app before purchasing it. Read reviews of the app as well as its description. If you come across a mention that an app supports VoiceOver, it's at least going to be useable for you. Before spending money on an app, it's a good idea to see if there's an entry about it in the app directories at www.applevis.com. This website has become the best place to go for guidance and information, especially for blind people making use of Apple products. It's well worth checking out thoroughly. In particular, there are directories with descriptions and reviews of apps. You will also find podcasts that demonstrate apps in audio form, so you can hear what it's like to use them. Do your homework, and you'll avoid disappointment.
    Your device can either be an occasionally used expensive paperweight, or it can grow into the most handy and affordable piece of accessible technology you've ever owned. After nearly a decade of using an iPhone, I've reached the point where I've found the best apps to do all manner of things. I don't even carry a laptop anymore when I travel. I simply take a small bag of accessories and my iPhone. The heaviest thing in the bag is a battery that could recharge my gear many times over and keep me going for around a week if necessary. I have reached this point through learning about and acquiring apps. These are typically far cheaper than similar software on my Windows laptop. Combine that with stupendously useful stuff like Voice Dream Scanner for reading print and BlindSquare for getting around, and you begin to see the possibilities for people on lower incomes. It simply doesn't get more portable, affordable and powerful.
    Another thing that the app store makes easier is contacting the developers of apps. As people gain confidence in using VoiceOver, they may start experimenting with buying apps that sound like they should be accessible. This is how many happy discoveries of apps that are quite accidentally useable or nearly useable by blind people have been made. Often, developers simply need to be contacted and made aware of the need or desire for their app to be made accessible, and they'll find a way to do it. King of Dragon Pass is a splendid example of how this can happen. Sadly, other less complex games that could have been accessible are not, since their developers were unaware of the potential market of blind users. Be polite and make your case. You might just do a big favour for thousands of people.

Using The Camera and Apps:
Having been totally blind all my life, I've often scoffed at that saying about a picture being worth a thousand words. To me, pictures meant information I simply couldn't access independently. They were what prematurely ended great conversations at family gatherings when someone with sight felt the need to interrupt proceedings and position people for those magical memory moments I could never see. The last thing I ever expected to have any use for was the camera on my iPhone. However, thanks to some very innovative and clever apps, the cameras built into your iOS device can open up incredible possibilities for blind people. In fact, they have turned out to be as valuable to me as any other hardware that Apple has seen fit to include.
    When I help someone learn about technology, I always search for something to show them that is simple and helps them pursue their own actual current interests. This gives them an answer to that ongoing question of why they should bother learning about their technology. It gives them something beneficial that they will actually want to start using between my opportunities to teach them more. It has to be something easy to do that doesn't demand perfection or a lot of practice before fun is had or useful results happen. The more I thought about it, the more obvious it became that the place to start blind people exploring in this way was, ironically, putting the camera to good use. While there's definitely a learning curve in terms of how you hold your iPhone and position the camera for best effectiveness, the apps designed for blind people are now straightforward to master.
    A camera on its own isn't very helpful to someone who can't see what they're taking pictures of. However, the magic happens when you use that camera in conjunction with other capabilities present in your iOS device. Connection is the key here. The right app will let you ask the artificial intelligence built into your device about what your camera sees. Suddenly, it becomes possible to identify objects or read print on pages or signs without any sighted help. Other apps make it easy to send video or pictures to sighted people or artificial intelligence systems, who can describe what they are seeing and tell you where to point your camera so that its viewpoint is optimally useful. With iPhones that fit in a pocket and are held in one hand, these implications are truly revolutionary. In this section, we'll explore what the front and rear cameras can do for you when combined with apps already on your device or obtained from the app store.
    Let's start with some basic orientation. Your iPhone has front and rear-facing cameras. The front facing camera is positioned behind the screen at the centre of the top edge of your iPhone. In more modern iPhones, there are other sensors including an infrared laser which lets your iPhone build a deep and precise map of your face for identification purposes. It is used to take pictures or video of whoever is holding the iPHONE. This is useful in virtual conferences and visual calls. Presuming you're facing your iPhone, this works quite well. People will see your face and some of your body clearly. The iPhone should be relatively close to you. No more than a meter away.
    The rear camera will give a far better and wider view of your surroundings, since that is its actual purpose. This is what photographers and other professionals use for taking both video and photos of events, people, and places. While the front facing camera is similar in different iPhones, this isn't as true for rear-facing cameras. The range of capabilities and the arrangement of the cameras varies depending on which iPhone you have. They will, however, always be placed within a roughly square area in the top-right corner of your iPhone. In addition to the camera or cameras, there is also a flashlight, which helps with taking photos in dark areas. On Pro model iPhones, there is a lidar projector. This projects an invisible light beam which detects the exact distance to objects. Lidar can enhance photos and be used to help detect and identify objects. Apple makes extensive use of artificial intelligence to help your photos look as good as possible.
    The Camera app is what people use to take pictures and shoot video. Don't let all the controls scare you. If you want to get into photography in a serious way, they'll doubtless be useful. There are plenty of YouTube videos, online groups and even a couple of books which would be helpful for a blind person wanting to fully understand the options at their disposal in this area.
    Those of us with less of an idea what we're doing are in good hands. Apple does a lot of the work for you when it comes to focussing on objects. We can simply point the camera at the page we want to read, the can of soup we wish to identify, etc. We can choose whether we want to take photos or record video. The results would certainly be better the more you understood about the lighting conditions and available options. However, for everyday tasks, such complexities don't seem to matter all that much. A steady hand and some trial and error will suffice.
The Camera Control:
The camera control button on my iPhone 16 Pro can be used to adjust the zoom or other aspects of pictures you want to take. I haven't found much use for it beyond summoning visual intelligence to get information and descriptions of objects. However, if you had to make adjustments and take pictures of something happening quickly, I can appreciate the potential usefulness of the idea. Owners of iPhones which have the camera control found on the right side below the power button should spend time in the camera settings. A lot of control is possible in the camera settings overall, but also through the camera control itself. You can lock focus on people or scenes, adjust photographic style, and much more. It is also possible to use the camera control to open other apps. Over time, apps such as Be My Eyes will likely allow use of this feature to take pictures or perform other tasks with greater ease.
The FaceTime App:
Borrow the Eyeballs of Family and Friends:
    Although there are many apps allowing for video communication, Apple has continuously developed FaceTime. It comes free with your device and is a part of iOS. This was the app that first showed me how very useful the camera in my iPhone could be.
    I reached into my pocket ... and it wasn't there! Handkerchiefs are splendid things to have handy when you need to wipe off messy fingers, so you can then use your iPhone without getting guck all over it. They have made my day more bearable on many occasions. They are also the most unbelievably frustrating objects to try finding once dropped. Furthermore, they make no sound at all when landing on apartment carpet or even hard floor for that matter. I had been given a dozen handkerchiefs and slowly lost most of them over the past six or seven years. At least, this time around, I was pretty certain that the handkerchief was lost somewhere in the apartment. Perhaps, I had gotten my keys or another object from the same pocket, and it had made its silent escape. I couldn't be certain how many days ago it had fallen from my pocket, so that meant it could have been in any number of places.
    There are, of course, time-tested methods for dealing with searching for dropped objects. The grid pattern search is the most thorough and laborious. I resigned myself to goodness knows how many minutes or hours of crawling around my apartment floor doing such a search. And then ... it dawned on me.
    Around the time I got my first iPhone, my father had gotten an iPad. We had chatted using the FaceTime app, which used the camera on the front of an iOS device to let people see each other's faces while talking. I remembered that I could switch it so it used the rear-facing camera. Rather than fruitlessly crawling around the floor searching, I called my father on FaceTime. He began telling me where to point the camera, so he could see the apartment floor and furniture where it could have fallen. It literally took him no more than a couple of minutes to look over the floor through my phone's camera and tell me where to reach down and retrieve the handkerchief. He didn't even have to leave his living room to help with finding stuff or reading printed documents. A few times, he even helped me restore my obstinately silent computer to working status by telling me where to point the camera and what was on the screen.
    Finding my lost handkerchief was my first mind-blowing experience of how very useful the tiny camera in the corner of my iPhone could be to blind people. Over time, it became a habit to FaceTime my father whenever I needed his eyes for tasks requiring working eyes. You can learn all about how to use the FaceTime app in the section called Reaching Out. For now, though, just remember that once you've started a call, feel the screen and find the button that lets you switch cameras.
Reading Print:
Another common barrier to blind people having equal access to information is that much of it is in print. Everything from mail in your mailbox to notices and signs in places you inhabit are presented in letters impossible for blind people to absorb unassisted even if they happen to feel a sign or paper, thereby finding out that the information exists. Having a portable talking device equipped with a built-in camera, you might think that apps which did that for us naturally came quickly. However, for quite some time, Apple was very cautious about how much control it allowed apps to have over the camera. As a result, achieving good optical character recognition or OCR as it's called for short, was very tricky, especially if people couldn't see to focus the camera well enough. Like so many things in iOS, the gradual opening up of such control presented possibilities that eventually resulted in an absolute triumph for blind people.
    My second truly mind-blowing experience with the camera on my iPhone happened on September 18, 2014, on the same day as the Scottish referendum. Thanks to the generosity of John Morgan, a philanthropist who I've had the honour and good fortune to call friend, I felt able to afford the most expensive app I've ever acquired. For quite a while, I had been hearing about a remarkable new app called KNFB Reader. An early demonstration of its capabilities involved someone taking a picture of a screen at the front of a large auditorium and having the print on the screen read out perfectly. This app could also help guide your hand as you positioned your iPhone above a sheet of paper to get that optimum shot for best recognition results. It was one of those things that felt either too good to be true or too revolutionary and life-changing to be available to ordinary people like me. However, the National Federation of the Blind was willing to fund the development of the app, teaming up with the legendary Ray Kurzweil who pioneered optical character recognition in service of blind people.
    I was using an iPhone 5S by this point, so I had the capability to run it. People were almost too ecstatic about what it could do. I heard stories of people effortlessly photographing even large poster-sized documents and getting nearly perfect OCR results. People talked of snapping pictures of signs on the street and learning what they said. It all sounded too good to be true. The price of over $130 Canadian certainly gave me pause. I could buy a good portion of a month's groceries or many Kindle books with that sort of money. I would, in all likelihood, have ultimately made the purchase. However, what decided me that day was an email and donation from John Morgan. He had heard of this remarkable app and wondered if I'd be interested in taking it for a spin and telling him what I thought of it. Naturally, at that point, I agreed. I purchased the app from the app store without difficulty, and it installed without any issues.
    I opened the app and read through the included instructions. For an experienced user like me, or even a beginner, it all struck me as simple and well thought through. I could use a feature called "field of view report" to get a sense of how well a document was in the camera's focus. Once I had gotten it in good position, I could take a picture, and the document in focus would be read out to me. This would apparently happen within seconds of my taking the picture. Testing it out on some smaller flyers I had gotten in the mail, I happily found that the app was as good and easy to use as people said it was.
    To really put my new app through the wringer, I found a large, poster-sized paper that the Ontario government had sent me. I had used my older version of Kurzweil 1000 and the OCR scanner on my desk to partially scan the document. It wouldn't all fit in the scanner, but I had gotten enough read to know it wasn't something I needed to wrestle with to hear the rest. However, if this new app worked like people had raved about, it wouldn't be nearly so hard and time-consuming to get the full document readable.
    I laid out the large sheet on my dining room table and made certain the room light was on. For once, it would actually be helpful to me, allowing the camera to take a better picture. Ordinarily, my apartment lights remained off, barring the presence of the occasional sighted visitors I had. Using the field of view feature as well as vibrations that gave me a sense of how tilted my iPhone was, it took several attempts before I found a position that let the camera take in the whole paper. Moving my iPhone farther above the paper and then getting another report, I was able to hone in on the perfect position for my iPhone. I knew I had found it when a field report told me that all four edges of the document were visible. Then, I carefully double tapped the Take Picture button. The camera sound played, and I waited, hoping I hadn't disturbed the position of the iPhone by tapping too hard. Since then, they made it possible to use the Volume Up button to take a picture, which is far less likely to jiggle your device. It took around ten seconds. I was just beginning to wonder if I had managed to crash the app when a synthetic voice began reading the document. Not just part of it. Absolutely all of it!
    The contents were about as deadly dull and unimportant to my life as humanly possible. Nevertheless, I was still absolutely spellbound. The paper was read out flawlessly. I had never read anything like this without there being a number of OCR recognition errors. You'd encounter them at least once every couple of sentences. There'd be nonsense characters or letters instead of numbers. It had been this way since my days in secondary school when I had gotten my very first scanner. That day, there were none. Clearly, the world had just changed again for blind people.
    The KNFB Reader app has now long since disappeared from the app store. The competition from drastically more affordable modern apps simply proved too much for it. There are now numerous excellent choices for people who need to have print read for them. The implications for today's students are absolutely profound. It might actually be useful for them to go to a library, borrow a book, and find the information they needed in it. They could read through forms and merely need sighted help to fill them in properly. All the work of character recognition happens on your own device, or, in some cases, with the help of artificial intelligence sponsored by a large corporation. Some apps do everything on your device. This means that your data is kept absolutely private and doesn't need to travel anywhere for processing. You can also export the text to other apps and share documents when you need to. Apps will use information, sound, or other methods to ease the process of making certain that text is in the camera's view.
    Once upon a time, I needed government funding to obtain the Kurzweil 1000 software I had been using for over a decade. Each time I wanted to get the latest update, I needed to pay over $100 to have it sent to me. The government agency spent over $1,000 initially to purchase my user license for the software. However, these days, for no more than I'd pay for a meal at a restaurant, I can choose from several accessible apps which make it possible to perform optical character recognition using a device I paid the same price as any sighted person.
VD Scan: Affordable Easy Print Recognition:
Almost immediately after I finished writing this section for the first edition in early 2019, another brilliantly simple and very affordable OCR scanning app appeared on the scene. Winston Chen, the developer of the various Voice Dream apps, has brought us yet another inexpensive masterpiece. VD Scan is designed as a standalone OCR solution. Once, it was an outgrowth of the Voice Dream Reader app. However, that app changed hands and is now under separate development by new ownership.
    For the cost of $5.99 US, you can purchase an app that gives often superior results to other OCR apps using the artificial intelligence on your own device. Since the first edition of this guide, it has been updated too many times to count. It has long ago gained the capability to decolumnize pages in books or other documents which have more than one column. Given this, I would now say that Voice Dream Scanner is able to more than adequately meet the needs of most blind people in need of OCR handled privately on their device. Just hold your device above print on a sheet, box, or anywhere else, and listen for a fairly quiet long tone. This tells you how much text is captured in the camera view. If you have edge detection turned on, it will be louder when all four edges are in the camera view. The louder the tone, the more text is in the camera's focus. Double tap on the Capture Image or Image Preview button, and the text will be interpreted. You can choose via toggle buttons whether text is then spoken automatically and whether a picture is taken automatically when the camera is in a good position.
    You can keep or discard scans and share results with apps like Voice Dream Reader, Dropbox, or pretty much any app that can use text. There are no additional costs or anything. VD Scan definitely makes the list of "must have" apps. No Cloud-based artificial intelligence is used, so anybody concerned with privacy can rest easy. It all happens using the artificial intelligence present on your own device.
Prizmo 5: A Mainstream Alternative Made Accessible
https://creaceed.com/iprizmo
    While KNFB Reader was certainly the first really noteworthy print reading app, it wasn't the only kid on the block for very long. Other apps appeared, attempting to offer OCR capabilities more affordably. By far, the most successful of these is one called Prizmo. It was designed to cater more to the sighted user. However, Creaceed SPRL, the app developer, took great care to incorporate support for VoiceOver and special guidance to help blind users orient their cameras to get good pictures of text. You can try the app free of charge, enough to get a sense of whether the app would suit your needs. Should you require more of its capabilities, you can purchase some capabilities outright, such as the ability to export and share text. Other capabilities take advantage of Cloud-based processing to offer enhanced accuracy above and beyond the already superb performance of the built-in OCR capabilities. Prizmo also offers language translation capabilities. If you hesitate to pay an ongoing subscription, you can instead pay for a limited amount of Cloud-enhanced accurate scans and translations. Otherwise, simply pay a one-time fee to unlock the exporting and on-device scanning capabilities of Prizmo, and you'll have yourself a very robust and portable OCR solution designed primarily for the needs of business people.
    This illustrates the power of large-scale economics. It was worth the time and effort of the developers of Prizmo to make their app totally accessible for blind users, even to the point of adding capabilities to indicate how much text was in view of the camera. The "Scene Description" button at the bottom right offers guidance. It also gives a sense of the number of lines of text in view. As you move the phone, lining up the document, Prizmo will try to instruct you how to move your hand to optimize what the camera captures when you ultimately take the picture. There are VoiceOver hints throughout the app, as well as other help offered in the app's Settings button, found at the top left. For a lot of people who feel comfortable using the camera, Prizmo will be more than sufficient to meet their OCR needs. For others, the more intuitive feedback and guidance that only an app designed from the ground up for blind users will be worth the possible extra expense. What once felt magical now feels a natural part of the everyday. Living in an era where blind people can now regularly make such choices between specialized apps built specifically for them or comparable, cheaper (and at times better) apps built for everyone still feels truly magical.
Object Identification:
Sadly, not all blind people have sighted friends or family in their lives who are so willing to lend their eyes when required. There are also times when, for instance, due to the lateness of the hour, it would be inadvisable to call upon one's sleeping friends. You might want to quickly find out what kind of cake you pull from the fridge to partake in a midnight snack, of which they may not approve of you having. Being able to have the benefits of sight for crucial moments here and there without inconveniencing people has always been a strongly held desire among blind people. Tapping into the capabilities built into your iOS device, app developers have now largely made this dream a reality.
Seeing AI: Putting it all Together
www.seeingai.com
    To really propel things forward takes a partnership. This partnership is between blind people, who own iOS devices and need to know about things in their lives, and a gigantic globe-spanning company working on cutting edge artificial intelligence with mind-boggling resources. One summer, the blind community was absolutely stunned when the Seeing AI app from Microsoft appeared in the app store. As a means of conducting ongoing research into accessibility and artificial intelligence, Microsoft had managed to leverage its artificial intelligence, massive image database, and computing power to come up with what is still a top-tier current "must have" app for blind people. It's called Seeing AI. This app is the Swiss army knife of handy tools making use of the camera. It has several channels that each perform different tasks. The channel you start on is for reading short text as the camera sees it. Touch the channel selector on the bottom right and flick up or down to get to other channels. More channels are added as new features are deemed ready for public experimentation. Other available channels currently include ones for reading larger documents, identifying objects or people, identifying currency, detecting the level of ambient light, describing scenes, and even reading handwriting. For people fortunate enough to have iPhones with LIDAr technology, there's a recently added "world" channel, which takes advantage of this to give you detailed information about objects in your surroundings and the distances to them. Microsoft continues to test and add more capabilities as time goes on. One of the latest additions in 2024 was a mode in the "world" channel that you could use to record a route visually as you walked along it so that you or someone else could use their iPhone's camera to walks that same route with guidance. Some of these features are still in what is called "preview" status, which basically means they're available for you to try but are not yet judged fully developed. This app is available free from the app store, and using it is free of any charges apart from possibly cellular data.
    It's impossible to properly convey the tremendous usefulness of the Seeing AI app, or the impact on the social media-using blind community. All through the first months during which the app was available, it seemed that there were torrents of tweets, Facebook posts, and podcasts about this small but monumental app. Nothing could knock Seeing AI off of the five most recently recommended app slots on the AppleVis home page. And this, despite the fact that users in the UK weren't initially included. The envy from across the pond was thick enough to cut. Its popularity has remained constant all these years later, even as other apps added similar capabilities.
    When you first run the app, you are presented with tutorials that pop up as you explore. They have videos produced by the app developers at Microsoft, which explain how the various features work. Once you've gone through those, the app will open into the default channel for reading short text. Touch the channel selector on the bottom right and flick up or down with one finger to change to different channels. The next two channels above short text reading are for reading whole pages and product identification via bar codes.
    Keep in mind that Seeing AI is a research project. Basically, this means that you're paying for the assistance you receive with the data you're generating. You are the product. As Microsoft's artificial intelligence assists you by reading text or describing people or objects, it learns from the images. Human app developers working on Seeing AI and other Microsoft products might make use of the image of a coffee cup you take a picture of, and have described to improve the ability of products using artificial intelligence to recognize coffee cups. A blind person might well have taken a picture of a coffee cup from a different, unusual angle than most images in an image library. I feel pretty safe in using it for most things, but wouldn't use it to get the security number of my credit card or anything sensitive like that. Always be aware of where images and data are going and be mindful of the motivations of people or companies who have access to it.
    Speaking of being aware of who gets data, consider the case of Lorna, my mother-in-law. Soon after my wife Sara and I began using the Seeing AI app, we visited with her family and showed them the app. With her eager permission, we decided to try the person description channel and take a picture of her mother, Lorna. Being fully sighted, she had seen herself in the mirror or pictures many times. She could give us an idea how good the app was doing at describing people. Sadly, tact and the preservation of life aren't things that the artificial intelligence in the Seeing AI app seems to consider when giving its opinions. Perhaps, it felt safe and snug deep inside Microsoft, out of reach of whom it studied. Upon examining that picture, my iPhone calmly informed her that she was a good couple of decades older than her actual age. She was less than thrilled with that description and jokingly warned me not to leave my iPhone unattended in her presence.
Envision AI:
A Smaller Team with a Different Approach:
    The Envision AI app tries to leverage artificial intelligence to provide a similar one-stop shop of functions to help blind people. Though similar in purpose to Seeing AI, it uses different Cloud-based artificial intelligence. This team is supported by blind and visually impaired people, rather than serving the initiatives of a larger company. They connect artificial intelligence with human intelligence to get the best results possible. Envision AI supports the use of Envision glasses, which can be worn like normal glasses. These glasses provide a more natural view since the camera is in the glasses rather than making use of the one in your iPhone. Bluetooth is used to connect the glasses with the Envision AI app on your phone. The app is constantly being improved. This app has moved from a subscription model to being free to use. For any Latin-based languages like English, you can recognize text offline using OCR and artificial intelligence in your device. While online, it can recognize up to 60 different languages. It is able to read handwriting.
    This app has an impressive array of features, including object and person detection. You can tell it what you're looking for, wave your device around and receive tactile and audible feedback giving you a sense of where the kind of object you want is. This also applies to people whose faces you have trained Envision to recognize.
    Double tapping on a button such as the Scan Barcode button activates that scanner, and you hear a short couple of rising tones indicating that it's scanning. Double tap the button again to stop looking for that particular thing. The app is very intuitive and easy to explore. In 2025, the Envision team added Ally, which includes a large language model built specifically to help blind people in daily life.
    There are many similar apps in the app store that each come at the same goal in a slightly different way.
SuperSense AI:
https://www.supersense.app
    This app is very similar to Envision AI. It uses artificial intelligence to identify objects, read barcodes, describe scenes, and more. People can subscribe monthly or annually. There is also a lifetime purchase option. There are occasional sales letting people choose the lifetime option very affordably.
    The app offers very useful audio feedback as you hunt for a barcode, focus a document in the camera, etc. Some features, such as reading short amounts of text, are available freely. However, most options in the app will only work during a free trial or once a subscription or lifetime purchase has been paid for.
    The app has the backing of many organizations related to blindness, as well as artificial intelligence.
    Simplicity of use is at the core of this app. Once opened, you'll be presented with some introductory material if it's your first time running the app. Subsequently, you'll be on the home screen in the last mode you used. There is a "read" mode for reading text, documents, bar codes, etc. Also, there is an "Explore" mode for scene description, finding objects, detecting people, etc. Other than the button which changes between modes, you'll find a start/stop button to tell the app whether it should be scanning continuously or not. Finally, there's a button at the bottom right which pops up a menu of options which are appropriate to the mode you're in. For instance, while in the "Read" mode, options for scanning documents, short text, etc will be found in the menu.
    At the top left of the main screen, while in either mode, you'll find a "menu" button. This gets you into a menu containing tutorials, a button for app settings, another to provide feedback, and more options. It is possible to request a phone call for support.
    This app provides a lot of audio feedback. While some may find this annoying, it can be disabled in the settings. Such feedback can be extremely helpful for beginners.
Ask And Be Answered:
Most of these apps have partnered with one or more of the growing list of companies which allow their artificial intelligence to analyze images and answer questions. The apps provide a bridge, removing any associated costs from being born by blind inquirers who might want to know more about the objects in the pictures they take. Be My Eyes, Envision AI, Seeing AI, and Aira have all added this capability.
    Every night, I remove my hearing aids and put them in their charger on my desk before going to sleep. Presuming they're inserted correctly and properly balanced in their slots, a green light will appear on the front of the charger below each hearing aid. The problem is that they might feel perfectly well inserted but not actually be. Tiny metal rings must be aligned with tiny contact points at the bottom of each hearing aid slot. Magnetic force helps keep the hearing aids in position but doesn't do as well at guiding them into the exact spots they need to be in. By itself, the two green lights do me no good at all. I don't have detailed enough light perception to see whether one, both, or neither light is on. They don't give off enough heat in order to feel their condition. There is no vibration or sound indication. Therefore, every night, I would need to use the Be My eyes app or FaceTime to get a sighted person to look through my camera and tell me whether the lights were on. I would then often have to spend five or more minutes of their time adjusting the hearing aids and repositioning the camera until the two green lights were showing continuously for at least five seconds or so. Now, unless the lighting conditions are very poor, I can simply take pictures of the charger and get descriptions from the artificial intelligence until I'm toll that the two green lights are on. This isn't entirely foolproof since the lights blink on and off while the hearing aids are charging. Also, it takes very little to knock a hearing aid out of position so that it isn't charging. Now, I can easily reposition the hearing aids if I find that this has happened. Charging my hearing aids is still more of a fiddly business than I'd prefer, but it isn't the annoyance requiring sighted assistance that it once was.
    The complexity of what can be asked goes well beyond whether two blinking lights are on. I can take a picture of my cluttered desk. I'll get an initial description back from Be My AI, which is a component of the Be My eyes app. It will give a reasonably detailed description of the many objects on my desk. These include a keyboard, soapstone bear, Rubik's Cube, collector's coin, charging station, iPhone and many more objects. Before very recently, that would be all you would get. If you wanted more, you'd need to get sighted help. Now, all of that has changed. I can type "What is the keyboard like?" into an edit field and get back a very detailed description focussed exclusively on the mechanical keyboard. I can then proceed to ask about other objects in the original picture without having to submit another photo.
    All is not perfect. The artificial intelligence bots behind these capabilities don't fully understand what they're seeing. They're performing pattern recognition. Occasionally, they will misinterpret what the camera sees. This is referred to as hallucinating. I got a new combination Bluetooth speaker and radio from Avantree. The BoomByte has a physical set of controls including a knob and eighteen buttons. These are in three rows of six identically shaped buttons. I needed to know which button did what. The manual, written for people who could see, wasn't at all helpful. I thought to take a picture of the controls on the device and ask Be My AI about them. It miscounted the total number of buttons and gave misleading information on the first try. I needed to correct it and inform it that there were eighteen buttons in three rows. Once I did that, it gave far more useful information and I was able to start using the BoomByte.
    If you're not in a hurry and have time and patience, this works well enough. It's a capability I didn't have before. Before this, I would have needed to enlist the assistance of a sighted volunteer or friend. When the consequences of such misinterpretation might have serious results, it is always better to seek sighted assistance. As an example of a hallucination, I once took a picture through a window at my church. I was curious about what a sighted person might see looking through it casually. It told me about a pack and water bottle on the cil below the window. It also described the trees, objects, and sky visible to the camera. This was taken in early August. However, the app reported leaves displaying bright Fall colours. A sighted person nearby heard the description and said that there weren't many leaves on the trees at all, and they weren't very colourful.
    In such a context, this imprecise description wasn't very consequential. However, such mistakes might well be important in other situations.
The Eyes Have It: Bringing Willing Sighted Help Where it's needed:
Let's face it. There are times when no amount of fancy artificial intelligence will do the trick. You need to hunt for something, complete a process, figure out where to write on a form, etc. There are problems that require an ongoing dialogue with a sighted person to be solved efficiently. With FaceTime, you must have someone in your family or circle of friends willing to help when needed. Not everyone has an iOS device. Nor are the sighted people in our lives always free or knowledgeable enough to help. There are currently several apps that seek to remove these limitations. We'll focus on two very popular apps that attempt to connect those who require sighted help with people who are willing and able to assist.
Be My Eyes:
www.bemyeyes.com
    The Be My Eyes app connects you via a video call similar to FaceTime with the first available volunteer who has made him or herself available to assist. The app shows the volunteer what the camera on the back of your device sees. The real utility in the Be My Eyes app is its ability to connect people requiring help with available volunteers who have time and are eager to offer assistance at any given moment. This is great for finding lost objects or picking out clothes that look good on you. The app also now has a section called Be My AI, which lets you ask your questions of Open AI's ChatGPT artificial intelligence, which uses data from such inquiries to improve itself.
    The app also has a section called "service directory" which lets blind people connect directly with sighted people from various companies and organizations who have created profiles and partnered with Be My eyes. A wide range, including personal health and beauty, tech support, accessibility, and other interests are available for those times when expertise is needed.
    This app won a much coveted Apple Design award in 2021. It was up against some very stiff competition in the categories in which it contended. It has also won partnerships with some businesses and is heavily used in many countries. As of early 2022, there were over five and a half million volunteers registered with Be My Eyes. The number of blind and low-vision users who ask this army of volunteers for help is approaching four hundred thousand. The volunteers collectively offer help in over a hundred and eighty languages. The community of people using Be My Eyes is spread through over a hundred and fifty countries. There's no pressure on volunteers to take calls besides what they put on themselves. If someone is too busy, another will step forward and take the call.
    Keep in mind that these are volunteers. All they have to do is complete a simple tutorial about how the app works. They aren't vetted for security and are unpaid. Don't use them for anything requiring sensitive information. While it is unlikely that people would volunteer with sinister motives, You never know. Someone could, for instance, make use of a credit card number you had the volunteer read to you. There are certainly ways in which this app and the blind people who use it might be abused by unscrupulous people. However, that cuts both ways to some extent. Blind people are certainly capable of abusing this app and, for instance, exposing a volunteer to some sort of shocking sight. There is a degree of accountability. Users as well as volunteers need to register with the app and have an account. This would provide a means of reporting bad behaviour on either side.
    Since the second edition was published, this app has partnered with the company responsible for the ChatGPT artificial intelligence. The partnership has resulted in a "be my AI" tab being added to the app. Instead of sighted volunteers, people now have the alternative of making use of the artificial intelligence which can analyze pictures, describe them, and answer questions about them. This is, for many situations, even more convenient for users of Be My eyes. I find this to be the case when charging my hearing aids. However, if I wanted an opinion on a piece of artwork or sighted help completing a more complex task, I would turn to the volunteers awaiting my call accessed from the "get support" tab of the app.
    To write this section of the guide, I wanted to test out the Be My Eyes app for myself. I found signing up to be easy. You do need to agree to the terms of use and use the app in abidance with those terms. Volunteers are never responsible for your safety. Nor can the developers of Be My Eyes be held liable for any misuse of the app. Once I had signed up, I placed a call by finding and double tapping a button called CALL First Available Volunteer. I have a collector's coin that I got after participating in a documentary called Get Lamp. It's available on YouTube and is about text adventure games. I asked the volunteer to describe each side of the coin. She did an impressive job of it and told me how to move my iPhone, so she could read me the small writing on the coin as well as describe the pictures. She had time for a brief chat and was curious about the documentary. I asked what she had to do to volunteer, and she described the simple tutorial she had completed.
    The experience was very simple and unhurried. However, one is certainly conscious of taking up a volunteer's time. Personally, I wouldn't want to use them for anything too lengthy. That call certainly gave me an idea of the ability of the camera on my iPhone 7 to focus on small images and what feels to me like tiny writing on the coin faces.
Be My Eyes App Overview:
The app has a very simple layout. There are five tabs across the bottom. These are labelled "get support", "Be My AI", "Service Directory", "Community", and "settings". When you open the app, you're placed in the "get support" tab. You'll find two buttons. The first is what you're most likely to use. It's labelled "call a volunteer". It does precisely what the label says. Simply double tap it and wait. If it's your first call, you may be asked to allow the app to use your camera, microphone, etc. The next button over is "my groups". This is where you can create and direct your call to friends, family, or other people signed up to be volunteers on Be My eyes who you feel more comfortable trusting with private information or specific situations.
    The "service directory" tab is where you can choose from a list of categories by double tapping the appropriate button. You'll also find a search field, so you can search if you know the name of a company or service who has signed up with Be My eyes to offer support to blind people through the app. An info button is also present, providing brief information on how to use this section. The available options have expanded tremendously since the second edition was published. So much so that this more specialized kind of support has its own tab.
    The "Community" tab is where you'll find easy access to stories from the community. You'll also be able to hear podcasts and read blog entries written by staff and community members of Be My Eyes. Social media links are also provided. People wanting to learn about what's possible with the app or become more involved in this community would do well to spend time exploring the contents of this tab.
    In the bottom-right corner is the "settings" tab. This has settings allowing you to manage your profile, adjust the notification settings for the app, choose your primary language and indicate other languages, and set up Siri shortcuts. All of this is pretty easy and uncomplicated. Beginners shouldn't have much trouble at all getting set up. The app will guide you through the necessary steps when you first run it, so the settings simply make it easy to change things you decided earlier.
Aira:
Competent Secure Sighted Help on Demand
    www.aira.io
    Aira, pronounced "eye ra", puts everything on a business footing. Aira hires agents who help blind people with everyday tasks. These people are vetted for security, so you can feel safer about sensitive information. Also, you, as a blind client, pay a subscription for a certain number of minutes each month. You can use them for whatever you like without feeling guilty for taking up somebody's time. The software used by Aira agents is far more sophisticated than that used by volunteers of Be My Eyes. It allows Aira agents to pull up maps or tap into your social media to recognize faces of people. Aira agents are trusted with your data due to their having been vetted for security, and this makes Aira potentially much more useful depending on your individual needs. Agents are trained extensively in how to describe things well and how to be as helpful as possible to blind people. Aira can be used in conjunction with smart glasses, giving a head-level, hands-free view more similar to eyesight to Aira agents. Imagine walking down a street and a voice in your ear telling you about a restaurant sign coming up ahead. The agent could also tell you that your friend John is approaching you from the left. That's what happens in one of the promotional videos you'll find on their website. Because these agents can access your location and other information, they can help you make travel decisions. During the setup process, Aira makes it very clear that they aren't responsible for your safety. They won't help you while you're travelling unless you are using a mobility aid like a guide dog or cane. They can, however, describe your surroundings and suggest different routes. Likewise, they could tell you about signs of businesses you're passing, where a taxi stand or bus stop is, or any number of details that might prove useful. They could help you operate an otherwise inaccessible ticket machine or read information from a restaurant's display.
    While writing this guide, Aira offered a free trial for everyone, which gave you thirty minutes that had to be used in seven days or less once your trial started. I took advantage of this to take Aira for a casual spin. Some of my thirty minutes were taken with going through the rules and answering some questions to set up my profile. This process is called "onboarding". Its purpose is to make certain people are clear on acceptable use and that Aira agents aren't responsible for your safety. The process has since been streamlined and should take less than the five minutes that it took me.
    The agent asked what she could help me with. In advertising the trial, people were encouraged to knock something off their bucket list. During the years I've lived in my apartment, I had often been told that I had a "good view" from my balcony. I decided to have the agent who took my call describe for me the view from the balcony of my apartment. I figured this would give me an idea of how wide an area could be seen from my iPhone's camera, as well as a sense of how well Aira trained its agents in the art of description. She spent a few minutes describing what she saw and answering some questions I asked. I was impressed by how much could be seen and with the detailed description I was given. She agreed to type up some descriptive text and attach it to a picture she took and shared with my iPhone. Unfortunately, the notes she quickly typed weren't at all equal to the in-depth description she gave. However, I got an idea of what it was like to stand and look out on a snowy afternoon from my balcony.
    As things currently stand, using the Aira service for calls that don't exceed five minutes once per forty-eight hours is free for guests who aren't subscribed-to a plan. Subscribers to an Aira plan can make one such call every twelve hours. We all have moments where it would be ever so useful to borrow a pair of trusted eyes for five minutes while travelling or around the home. The hope is that using the Aira service in this way will cause people to want more extensive time and pay for subscription plans. Paid subscribers or people in sponsored locations will get priority if call demand is higher than what can be dealt with. Those wanting to use the service for free will sometimes be unable to if call demand is high. They are advised to wait and call back later. The Aira Explore app also has an artificial intelligence capability which can be used at no cost, even by guests with no subscription plan. Access AI can give descriptions which are brief, detailed, in everyday language, or with more technical terms allowed. It is possible to send the generated descriptions for free verifications by Aira agents, who can clarify anything which the AI may have gotten wrong. These provisions make the Aira Explore app worth keeping on your iPhone even if you don't require a paid plan.
    A wide variety of subscription plans are available, ranging from twenty minutes per month to far more costly plans giving hours of time per month. There are other opportunities for using Aira regardless of whether you have a plan. Businesses can offer free Aira support to blind people visiting their locations. There is also a program to help people seeking jobs. Those who have paid plans also benefit from these offers and don't lose minutes if their calls meet the conditions of such offers. This further enhances the usefulness of Aira to non-paying blind people or those who opt for plans with fewer minutes per month.
    Anyone who wants to use Aira extensively should go to their website or use the Aira Explore app to learn about the various plans available. Changes and special offers may happen at any time.
    Putting things on a business footing has a more profound psychological effect than you might think. While you might hesitate to use a volunteer's time for anything lengthy or complex, the mindset changes when you're paying for a service. As fate would have it, a friend of mine posted a perfect example of this on Facebook while I was working on this section of the guide. Michelle McQuigge doesn't consider herself particularly handy with tools or good at assembling things. However, she had bought a heavy-duty laundry cart and decided to use an Aira agent's help to try assembling the cart without help from her more mechanically inclined sighted friends. The agent was able to find the assembly instructions on the Internet and then talked Michelle through the process of putting her new cart together. That just floored me. I can't count the times in life where I've sat still or stood out of the way while someone sighted has tired him or herself out putting some piece of furniture together for me. An experience common to blind people is that sense of being more than willing to do the work for oneself if a sighted person would just patiently say what needed to be done and where things were. For Michelle, Aira made that dream come true.
    The idea of attending an event and being able to get to your seat or know what's around at a festival independently is very compelling. You could tour a convention haul or have paintings in a gallery describe to you. Aira really pushes this active and engaged lifestyle in its advertising. While the introductory plan plus five minutes here and there might be useful for a few quick tasks around the home, you wouldn't want to go on a day-long expedition with that plan. Attending a convention or exploring a setting, you'd want more time available. Aira certainly hopes so and appears to be getting its wish, as enough people are subscribing to make things viable, along with fees from business and other locations where Aira is free for any visitors to use. Early 2020 saw a group of investors partner with Aira. Despite this investment, they've had to scale back what they offer free of charge. As of 2025, they're still figuring out what can be offered sustainably and have leaned more heavily into artificial intelligence. With world economics undergoing substantial change as I update this in 2025, that quest for real stability looks set to continue. Keeping a business offering such a valuable service afloat while wanting to help as many people as possible isn't an easy balance to find.
    It is possible for users of Aira to capture their experiences and stream them if they wish. There have been streams posted to YouTube and incorporated into Aira's monthly podcasts. Tours of attractions and events and other places have been given. This makes for entertaining listening and powerful advertising for the service.
Aira Explorer App Overview:
The layout of this app is similar to that of Be My Eyes. There are four tabs across the bottom. "Home" is at the far left and is where you'll default to when opening the app. In it, there is a "help" button as well as buttons for applying a free call offer, calling via your smartphone, and beginning a call with an initial message for the responding agent. That's it for the home tab.
    Next is the "Access AI" tab. This is where you can get help from an artificial intelligence which Aira has partnered with.
    Next is the "Usage" tab. This is where guests who don't have paid plans can check to see if they can make a five-minute free call. Paid subscribers can look at a breakdown of their plan and a log of minutes used. Feedback can be given on prior calls. Because I don't have a paid plan, I can't describe this tab fully here.
    The "More" tab at the far right is where you can find settings and profile management options. You'll also find access to the excellent guide and training material offered to help people get the best use possible of their minutes with Aira agents.
Camera Conclusions:
I've continued to be delighted by the many ways in which the camera in my iPhone has proved a vital part of my everyday life. As the costs of artificial intelligence, computing power, internet connectivity, and camera technology go down, the possibilities for even those of us on low incomes will continue to grow. Thankfully, ways are being found to tap willing people and the vast resources of companies to improve the lives not only of blind people, but of everyone who gains from artificial intelligence.
    The past two years of what is generally regarded as post-pandemic life have tested everyone involved with these apps, be they developers, staff, businesses, users, or volunteers. Public awareness of these apps and their capabilities has risen sharply as a direct result of the pandemic. More people needed to get help while safely distant from others. All kinds of compelling stories have been tweeted, blogged and released as YouTube videos. Moments of crisis where Aira, Be My Eyes, Seeing AI and other apps have made a tremendous difference in the lives of blind people and those who have stepped forward to help.
    A level of maturity has made itself felt in these apps. Partnerships with businesses and artificial intelligence facilities have rapidly become commonplace in this area. Behind the scenes, finding stable business models for these apps to be affordable for low-income users is still proving to be a tricky proposition. Things are moving rapidly. This section of the guide may very well be the first to become obsolete due to changes in this area. Competition is very stiff between these apps. I'm fascinated to see where both the charitable and business efforts to put the cameras on iOS devices in the service of improving the lives of blind people end up going over the next decade. Both Be My Eyes and Aira are doing all they can to increase awareness and reach of their services. To find out more, you may wish to subscribe and listen to the podcasts offered by each of these major players. Currently, in early 2022, you can hear the Aira Cast, which offers everything from news and interviews with Aira staff and clients to recorded events experienced through Aira. Meanwhile, Be My Eyes has two podcasts. The Be My Eyes podcast is similar in many respects to the Aira Cast. The latest podcast from them is called Thirteen Letters, which discusses accessibility more broadly with experts in many areas who are interviewed about their work making life more inclusive for people with disabilities.
    There's quite a lot of potential for amazing, productive ideas. What really excites me is how all of this is done through a piece of technology commonly used by all sorts of people, be they blind, sighted, disabled in other ways, or fully able-bodied. This brings large-scale economics to bear on problems that formerly relied on smaller niche markets and special charity or government economics. That in itself is a massive game changer, whose implications are still very much in their infancy.
    Sadly, I think there is some cause for worry about an increased divide between blind people who succeed in finding steady enough employment to tap into what paid services like Aira offer and those who aren't as successful. On lower income levels, you quickly hit a Catch-22 where you spend so much on the service that you have no money to go places to put it to the more spectacular use that their advertising pushes. However, I think the costs will fall over time as more businesses join as sponsors or partners. Furthermore, I'm hopeful that these services will have a trickle-down effect through changing public attitudes about the possibilities for blind participation in spheres of life.
    The fear surrounding what governments and massive corporations will do with the data we generate is still, I believe, a limiting force on what's possible. Personally, I think a lot of that fear is misplaced. People aren't really weighing up the benefits and hesitate to reach for the ready help that artificial intelligence can provide. For blind people, I see more of a danger from the one-on-one connections between them and the sighted people they connect to. It's far more likely that an unscrupulous person would take advantage of a bank account number accidentally revealed while trying to bring a package of oatmeal on a cluttered countertop into focus, or something of that nature. In such a case, though, is that very slight risk more or less dangerous than not knowing whether that package of oatmeal contains ingredients you're allergic to? Might it be worth trusting a volunteer or paid agent to help you use that otherwise inaccessible vending machine to get a snack or pay for a ticket you need in a hurry? In exchange for a bit of mindful sensible trust that help is now available through your iOS device.
    Above my discussion of each app covered in this section, you'll find a link to the website about it. There are all kinds of podcasts, videos, and other information for each app, so you can get a sense of whether it suits your particular needs. A simple Google search can yield more independent reviews and demonstrations of these apps. People tend to talk a lot about things that have positive impacts on their lives. Take advantage of that to get a good sense of what's possible and how you might use that little round camera in the corner of your iOS device.
    Remember to think out of the box. Nothing stops you as a blind person from using the camera for the same social purposes as a sighted person. From pictures posted to online dating sites to Facebook photos, blind people are getting up to all kinds of social activity. There are even blind YouTube stars who have many sighted followers. We'll cover that in greater detail in the section dealing with social media. There are lots of implications for making friends and sharing experiences with that little camera and other technology in your iOS device. New possibilities are emerging all the time, so keep an ear out for them.

Accessible Games on iOS
It's mid-February 2024 as I begin working on updating this section. Not even a full two months old, this year has already proved to be one marked by a number of big leaps forward for mobile accessible gaming. The latest arrival, Brock the Investigator, is a well regarded graphical adventure game. It attracted a lot of attention by being as accessible to everyone as possible. Having already met with enthusiastic responses on the PC and consoles, it has now been ported to the iPhone. I got wind of this mere days before it was released. Spending the ten dollars to get the full premium package with all content unlocked was a no-brainer. At over a gigabyte in size, this was one of the largest games I had bought.
    Why this game was so large quickly became obvious as the tutorial progressed. Rather than making use of Apple's accessibility tools, this game developer decided to create its own system. The game had over twenty-three thousand lines of speech recorded by actors plus narration done using high quality synthetic speech. Absolutely everything was described in detail. The audio perspective panned, and a buzzing sound indicated when the in-game camera changed positions in the environments your character was in. That environment surrounded me with fully detailed sound and music. It was like sitting in the middle of a movie scene you could interact with and move around in. My iPhone vibrated as I felt around the layout of an apartment and found objects to interact with. This included a dangerous fire, a blanket, a picture, broken furniture, a trapped lady underneath that furniture and some robots. A series of tutorial messages explained the basics of navigating, inventory management and combat as I made my way through the rather grim depicted circumstances. By the time I left that burning apartment, I had an inkling of the hours of fun and frustrations ahead of me.
    All the features one could wish for were built into the game. These included extensive hints, support for Bluetooth game controllers, the ability to skip fights or puzzles, directional audio for action sequences and combat, adaptations so all puzzles could be solved by blind players, and many more. Brock the Investigator set a high bar for inclusivity and accessibility of a kind of game blind people typically found themselves unable to experience. A clear illustration of what was possible on an iPhone if enough thoughtful effort was made.
    I've always found that the lessons which really stuck with me were learned while I was so busy having fun that I didn't notice any gain of skill or knowledge until afterwards. Games make for wonderful teachers. As a boy, I basically taught myself to type fast and accurately to find out what happened next in text adventure games playable on the Apple computer I had. Later, when it came time to take typing class, I was way ahead of everyone due to this early play. That experience has stuck with me and served me well over the years. Those same games taught me a great deal more. In text adventure games, everything is built from, described by, and controlled by words. As a result, I learned a lot about places and objects in the real world. Games of resource and risk management taught me lessons about everything from greed, probability and time management. Meanwhile, audio games taught me how to make the very most of my hearing and sharpened my reflexes. Multiplayer strategy and role-playing games taught me many lessons about trust, teamwork and how to relate to others in pursuit of goals.
    I've always encouraged beginners to obtain and play games with their new technology. It helps get past feelings of intimidation and gives them a compelling reason to use their devices. In far too many cases, people have a grudge against technology simply because they don't find ways to enjoy what they have. Blind people are particularly vulnerable to this. While technology is often portrayed as a means to fun for sighted people, it is largely touted as a means of accomplishing things independently for blind people. The sad disadvantage of this is a kind of grudge against the very things that can make meaningful change in our lives. The computer which becomes a sighted child's gateway to adventure can all too often be the equivalent of the broom which lets a blind child do his or her chores around the house. Thankfully, I had teachers at a young age who understood this. They went out of their way to supply us with accessible and enjoyable games built for entertainment rather than education. This had a tremendously positive impact on me. People who are hoping to vanquish their friend in a game or solve a murder mystery have a vested interest above and beyond mastering something that seems new, difficult, and disconnected from their everyday concerns. Good games feel neither daunting nor dull. They pull you past their interface and mechanics, right into their captivating headspace. While you're playing, figuring out how to operate your device or review the screen transforms from a dreaded chore into the means to an exciting and desirable end. This section is my attempt to pass on that legacy of fun engagement to an environment where it's most needed. Using a touchscreen is a struggle for many blind people. Finding games which you actually want to play could be the deciding force in someone choosing to keep trying to master their iPhone. The economic and social advantages of using mainstream technology used by the rest of society rather than more limited purpose-built devices made specially for blind people cannot be overstated.
    There are a great many accessible games for iOS devices. An exciting aspect of the iOS platform is that Apple's included accessibility tools make it easier for developers to design mainstream apps and games in a more inclusive way. This lets blind people play at least a small fraction of some of the same games their sighted friends and family can also enjoy. On admittedly rare occasions, you'll potentially find that a game you like as a blind player is ranked highly in the top charts of the app store. To find a prior occasion where a game enjoyed by blind people was popularly played in mainstream society, you'd need to go back to the early 1980s. Before arcade games became dominant on home computers, there were the days of text-based adventure games. Mind-bending experiences like Colossal Cave, Zork, and other commercial interactive fiction from companies like Infocom commanded top dollar. People stayed up at night, desperate to solve that next puzzle before their friends did. Presuming you can find copies of the data files, I'll be discussing an app that lets you enjoy a great many classic adventure games, including Zork and other Infocom titles, later in this section.
    Most of the time, before the advent of iOS, it usually took until after a game stopped being popular for people to figure out how to make it accessible. Thankfully, on this front, things are changing. Different economics and fundraising tools like Kickstarter are presenting blind people who have iOS devices with new gaming opportunities and unique experiences. It is now possible for us to leverage our dollars to make developing accessible entertainment more attractive and possible. It is also more economical on iOS for people to use the accessibility features built into the iOS operating system to make apps accessible right from the start, rather than years after they're released to the public.
    In this section, we'll take a tour of some different types of games that are fully accessible and therefore safe to acquire without risking the disappointment of finding that a game is inaccessible. We'll also look at opportunities for playing with other people, which apps and capabilities on your iOS device make possible. Rather than going into great detail about how to use all the apps discussed here, I'll pick out some apps that illustrate conventions and techniques found in other apps that will be more briefly discussed. You may not enjoy all the games I cover. Hopefully, you'll find at least a few games that appeal to you. Also, keep in mind that there are likely more accessible games that have gone undetected by the blind community and/or by yours truly. More than one developer has been surprised to hear from blind people who were able to at least partially play their games. Quite often, such surprises have led to full accessibility. While there may not be a game in a genre you prefer, you can at least be certain that the apps described here have been made with blind players in mind. While the number of games is growing pretty rapidly when compared to prior accessible platforms, not all genres have been made accessible. I hope you find something that suits your interests, allowing you to partake of the benefits that games can bestow on people who hope to be more comfortable and proficient users of iOS devices.
Breakthrough Behind the Scenes:
Sometimes, change arrives with such little fanfare that nobody notices right away. This was absolutely the case with Apple's accessibility plugin for the Unity app development platform. For over a decade, you could almost bank on a game made using Unity to be totally inaccessible to blind players. It didn't matter how little importance graphics or pictures played in the actual game. There was simply no easy way for developers to hook the output from the Unity engine into Apple's accessibility features like VoiceOver. This changed formally in 2022 when Apple released its accessibility plugin.
    At the time, I didn't pay this much heed, since there were no actual games which were widely known to have used this plugin. Apple would have been smarter to perhaps have a game which was made accessible thanks to this plugin, ready to recommend to VoiceOver users or to include with the operating system. Microsoft and other companies have seen the wisdom of including one or more games for people as a way of helping them get comfortable with the basic interface. Apple does include a Chess game with their Mac operating system. Such a popular, well-known game, with much more substantial tutorial help with learning VoiceOver and iOS, would go a long way to helping blind people become more proficient with iPhones.
    I first got an inkling of what a substantial breakthrough for accessibility this plugin could be towards the end of 2023. This was when a number of what are called rogue-like deck builders began being made accessible. Although played with cards, these games and the cards they use are about as far from traditional as it's possible to get. A game called CyberCards was made accessible first. Another game called Conjury also emerged having been made accessible. Both of these games were available for sighted players prior to this point and were made accessible post release. This was previously a rarity for a game having the same levels of complexity and graphics. If a game wasn't accessible by the time it was released, there was scant chance of a developer putting in the time and resources to make it accessible. Now, suddenly, the effort required to make substantially complex games accessible had been lowered.
    CyberCards is a futuristic hacking adventure where you attempt to defeat opponents while preventing them from completing missions which do extra harm to your character. Conjury has you be the chosen adventurer trying to make your way through an enchanted forest, defeating monsters using various food, equipment, and weapons found along the way. All items in these games are represented by cards. There are over two hundred and fifty unique cards in Conjury. Other games have many more. Each of these cards has artwork as well as information. This is far more information than on ordinary playing cards which might tell you that it's an ace of spades. A conjury card might inform you that it's a magic sword of the sea. This weapon has an attack of 6 and a durability of 3. It also informs you that every time you play a fish card, you increase this weapon's attack by a point. Provided that you waited long enough and played enough fish cards before using this weapon, you could defeat most enemies with a single stroke. Other cards, such as Sharpen or Reinforce, would let you maintain the durability of this weapon and further increase its attack strength. Finding such combinations or synergies between cards is a key aspect of this sort of game.
    In January 2024, another rogue-like deck building game was released. Billing itself as an "epic cardventure", Dawncaster more than lives up to that description. Taking place in a sprawling fantasy world with zones to travel through and a number of characters to interact with, it has the feel of a single player board game. Choices made in the land and in managing your character's resources are just as consequential as those made in card combat. This takes the rogue-like deck building genre to its limits with a great deal of complexity and replayability. At the time of this writing, there are at least a thousand cards in Dawncaster and five expansions to its game world. No two games of Dawncaster would come out the same even if you used the same random seed number.
    The arrival of Dawncaster accomplished something else worthy of note in the history of accessible mobile gaming. Typically, blind people would find that someone would make a simple game in a genre accessible. This would serve as a proof of concept showing that it was indeed possible to make a kind of game accessible. However, in all too many cases, nobody ever built upon that example game, and we would be left with just a taste of what could be. Pinball is a perfect example of this. We have a version of pinball done using audio, which illustrates the basic concepts beautifully. In Blindfold Pinball, the ball gets quieter as it rolls farther up the table. The noise pans left and right in the stereo field. Rising hint sound indicates when the ball is in striking range of the flippers and gives a sense of the ball rolling past the point of no return. Objects the ball collides with are in the stereo field. Great! We have audio Pinball. Sadly, nobody has taken this basic example and built anything like the more complex tables experienced by sighted players for decades. However, this time with rogue-like deck builder games, in a matter of a few months, we were graced with both ends of the spectrum. Conjury is the most approachable of these games for complete beginners. CyberCards is somewhere in the middle when it comes to complexity. Dawncaster is an example of the fully developed maximized possibilities of this kind of game. Blind people can fully access all of these games while they're still fresh enough to be discussed and played by the sighted players they were designed for.
    Had it not been for Apple's work creating the Unity accessibility plugin, this rare moment in accessible gaming would never have happened. Presuming Apple maintains and improves on this plugin, this has wonderful implications for app accessibility, which extend beyond blindness and beyond gaming. Many apps now have a substantially greater chance of being made accessible to users who have a wide range of disabilities.
Dice World:
For casual players wanting something social, friendly, and easy to start playing, Dice World tics all of these boxes nicely. Designed for sighted casual players, the developers have done a great deal to make their app wonderfully accessible to blind players. They have reached out to the blind community and are eager for any suggestions and feedback. They are also committed to making certain that future games they create are accessible to blind people. Using the Dice World app, blind players can compete on a completely equal footing with sighted friends and family. They can also socialize using messaging facilities included in the app that are accessible using VoiceOver. Little wonder then that even years after its release, Dice World remains extremely popular.
    The Dice World app currently contains six games of chance. These include Farkle, Yatzy, Balut, Pig, Threes, and 1-4-24. The rules for these games are comparatively simple, but decisions can get tricky. This is especially true for Balut, which is akin to Yatzy but played with more spots per category of roll. These games can be played against artificial or real players. You can play with friends or make new ones among the community of thousands of players around the globe. Facilities for chatting with your human opponents, either by typing messages or recording messages, are also included. It's a great app for beginners. The games are simple to play and not too time-sensitive. There is plenty of help and tutorials for beginners or people who are unfamiliar with the various dice games. Let's explore this app in detail.
    The first time you open the app after obtaining it free from the app store, you'll be taken to a dialogue that asks whether to start as a new player or log in with an already existing account. This latter option lets you have the same account on more than one device if you like. Starting out as a new player will create an account for you. You can then go into the settings found inside the app and change your account email and password. I recommend you do this, so you can better remember the information should you want to log in from another device or need to reinstall the app.
    Once you've completed the login process and your account has been created, you will be ready to play and will find yourself in the app's main screen.
    At the top of the main screen, you'll find the dashboard. This consists of a bunch of your current statistics. You'll see the number of games you've won, lost, and remain active in. You'll also see which level you've reached and the amount of progress you've made towards the next level. Make progress by winning games and tournaments that earn you bonus rolls and experience points or XP. Higher levels require more XP to complete. Reaching a new level will reward players with bonus rolls and other perks, such as unlocking fancy dice they can use.
    Past these statistics, there's a button to get to even more statistics. These cover your game play in far greater detail and are meant for more hardcore players. Another button accesses your collection of medals you've won. These are gained by achieving certain things in the game, such as beating AI opponents. When you win a medal, you will be informed. You'll also see your current number of available bonus rolls. These are used during game play to re-roll dice and perhaps obtain a better result. Past that, you'll flick to options to enter the store, join a tournament, or start a new game.
    Beyond those options, you'll find headings separating games where it's your turn, your opponent's turn, and recently played games. At the very bottom, you'll find options to open the chat centre, access settings, and earn free bonus rolls by watching advertisements. Flicking on any of these and waiting around a second will result in VoiceOver Hints being read if they are enabled.
    This app uses several conventions that apply no matter which game you might be playing. For example, while inside a game, you'll find two buttons labelled Help. Presuming you have VoiceOver Hints enabled, you'll hear that the left most help button provides access to game rules. Meanwhile, the button at the far right will provide more context-sensitive help, such as which moves are possible to make. You'll always find a sequential row of any dice used in a game. Double tap on a die with one finger to select or deselect it before initiating a roll. You will always find the button that lets you access ongoing message conversations or chats at the top left of the screen, near the Back button.
    To get a sense of how games in Dice World work, we'll play through a round of two games, namely Farkle and Yatzy. In doing so, you'll get a better sense of how two very different game screens work. That is, games with scorecards such as Yatzy versus games where each player has a score earned during a round of play, such as Farkle. Let's begin.
A Round of Farkle:
I'm in the middle of a game of Farkle with my friend Michelle. Having recently lost what low vision she had, she also faces learning challenges. The design of this app made it a suitable candidate for her. The chat system built into the app is simple enough to manage using common conventions familiar to her. Also, the games are easy to play and can be enjoyed even if you don't fully grasp probabilities. She first mastered the game of Pig, where you need to roll a total of one hundred points before your adversary. Farkle is a bit more complex. You have to be the first to reach ten thousand points. During each round, you roll from an initial pool of six dice. This pool shrinks by one or more dice each roll, since at least one die must be locked. With each roll of the remaining dice, the danger grows that none of them will be useable. This is called a "farkle" and ends your turn during this round of play, forfeiting any points scored previously during the round. To be useful, a die must come up either as a one, a five, or be part of a set of three or more dice showing any other number.
    It's currently my turn in our sixth round of play. At the top of the screen, there's the Back button. I then see the game title, Farkle Bonus. The "bonus" indicates that Michelle and I can each use a bonus roll during each round if we wish. Waiting after reading the title allows the VoiceOver Hints system to inform me that I will get the final roll of the game. Flicking right, I find our current score, a chat button should I wish to communicate, and my opponent's current overall level in Dice World. I then come to information regarding the last five rounds of play.
    Below this information, I reach my pool of dice. Rather than flicking, I can simply touch where the dice are on the screen, getting to them much more quickly. Since I have yet to roll, they are in their default positions, sequentially from one to six. Flicking past these, I come to the Actions heading. Using the rotor, I could turn it to headings and simply flick down to reach actions. Flicking right past this heading, I find my game options. The Bonus Roll button is present, since I have yet to use my bonus roll this round. I flick right and double tap on the Roll button. I roll 2, 4, 4, 4, 3, and 6. If it weren't for those three fours, I would have farkled out and had to use my bonus roll or forfeit the round. Flicking right past the now inactive Roll button, I double tap on the Select All button. This is a shortcut to select and lock all possible dice. I now have three remaining dice free to roll again. Since I have a good supply of thousands of bonus rolls and still have my bonus roll to use during this round, there's no reason not to do this. I get 3, 6, and 3, which results in a farkle. I find the Use Bonus Roll button and double tap this. In a massive stroke of luck, I get 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, and 6. A full set of six dice is worth fifteen hundred points. What's more, I can roll all of these dice again. You can farkle on a roll of six dice, but the risk is small. I double tap the Roll Again button, yielding two 5s, a 1, and three 6s. Luck is certainly with me. I double tap the Select All button and can once again roll all six dice. I now have 2,700 points this round. I get matching sets of 5, 1, and 2, meaning that once again, I can select all the dice. This brings my total for the round to 3,450. I roll once again ... and my luck runs out as I sadly farkle on a six-dice roll. I would have attained a substantial lead had I not been so greedy, but as I say, the chance of a six-dice farkle is relatively small. I forfeit all 3,450 points, and the game passes to Michelle, who must take her turn.
    As you can appreciate, the real dilemmas come when you find yourself with say 3,500 points that you could bank but still have four dice free to roll. Farkle is full of choices like that and never seems to get old. There's enough skill involved that good play matters, but enough chance that anybody can come from behind and win. It's a great way to learn about risk management.
A Turn of Yatzy:
The Yatzy screen is a full one due to the scorecards of both players being present. All the options common to all games are present. This includes a Hint button at the bottom right that gives you a list of possible moves. I currently have no games of Yatzy in progress, so I select New Game and then choose the Computer Player option. Selecting from the artificial players, I then select yatzy as my game. Since I'm playing against an artificial intelligence, I can't use my bonus rolls as I could in my game of Farkle against Michelle.
    Turning the rotor to Headings, I flick down to reach the Action's heading and flick right to Roll 1. I get 4, 5, 6, 6, and 6. Not a bad first roll. Since I have VoiceOver Hints enabled, my possible moves are read out to me. It's a nice long list. I could score 27 in the 3-of-a-Kind and Chance categories. Alternatively, I could settle for 18 in the Sixes category. Choosing to go for more 6s, I flick past the Roll button to the Select All button. Flicking down, I set it to "Sixes" and double tap that. This results in all three 6s being held, as VoiceOver informs me. Next, I flick to the Roll 2 button and double tap it, taking my second roll. The two free dice come up 5 and 2. Not what I hoped for.
    I could take my third and final roll or score 25 in 3-of-a-Kind or Chance categories as my best options. I decide to take that final roll with the two free dice. The 6s remain held, and if you flick over them with VoiceOver, it will say "selected" before reading the value of the die. I double tap the Roll button, which indicates that this is my third roll. Sadly, I end up with the two free dice, showing 4 and 2. In retrospect, I should have stuck with my original 27 points rather than the 24 points I have ended up with. I never like using my Chance slot so early in a game, which leaves the 3-of-a-Kind category as my best option here.
    There are a couple of ways to indicate where you want to put the score. You can feel or flick through the scorecard and double tap on the correct button. Alternatively, to the right of the available actions, you'll find a list of choices containing your valid moves. I double tap on the 3-of-a-Kind button and am immediately routed to the Play button. Double tapping this will submit my score and end my turn. I could reconsider and change my mind at this point, but choose not to. I double tap Play and end this round. It comes as some consolation that the artificial player I'm contending with ended up with three 1s being its best option.
    In games with human opponents, you have various ways of interacting beyond simply taking your turn. You can chat using a messaging system, exchanging typed messages with the person you're playing against. You'll see notifications of new messages as you take your turn in the game the two of you are playing together. You can also use the chat centre, which has all of your ongoing chats available. You can also nudge or remind players to take their turn. Games left unplayed for four days will be forfeited. Look around for even more options and styles of play, including tournaments. Full exploration of the Dice World app will prove rewarding.
Interactive Fiction Games:
In earlier times, these games were once called text adventures. They've been around since 1976 when Colossal Cave made its first appearance on a room-sized mainframe computer on a university campus. In this classic adventure game, you type in simple two-word commands to explore a vast cave system and find various treasures. The genre has expanded over the years. There are now many forms of interactive fiction. The unifying characteristics are that the games allow their players to advance a story by making choices.
    For the most part, these games weren't designed to be accessible to blind players. Indeed, some puzzles in various text adventures would require a working knowledge of colours to solve. However, because they were based on text and used simple interface elements, they proved to be accessible to screen readers. I grew up playing and learning a great deal from these games. Fortunately, the iOS platform has proved to be fertile ground for such entertainment. They have a special place in my life.
    Made by numerous developers, these games are based on stories where players must make choices affecting the outcome. These choices may involve solving puzzles and managing an inventory of items. They might involve simply choosing between alternatives regarding what happens next. There is a broad variety of style in this class of game. You'll also find an expansive range of story genres. Everything from adventure, to romance, to mystery, to horror, to science fiction. The unifying idea is that a work of interactive fiction requires players to somehow be able to alter or progress through the story through their own choices or actions.
    Easy examples for beginners would be Time-crest, Delight Games, Choice Of Games, and Hosted Games, which are all collections of games in the choose your own adventure style. In all these games, you can flick left or right to read text and choices, double tapping on the choice you want. There are also often tabs across the bottom giving you access to different areas of the game like a screen with inventory or statistics on your progress. This easy-to-handle format has proved popular among sighted players wanting a change from the arcade or picture-heavy experience. The developers of games made in this style typically respond eagerly to suggestions and feedback, and deeply value their growing good reputation among blind players. Another big advantage for beginners is that the need for typing is kept to a minimum.
    Over time, what were once a deluge of separate apps each being a single story have been collected into library apps of stories that use the same overall system. For instance, all the Choice of games can be gotten from within the Choice of Games app. You then purchase any titles you wish as in-app purchases. Alternatively, many of these libraries offer the option of paying a subscription or a one-time fee for access to all current and future titles. Each story game can provide hours of fun without any time pressure or the need for fast reflexes. Everything waits until you actually make a choice.
    I've often thought that games such as these would be very helpful for people who are learning Braille. You can certainly play them with a Braille display, reading the story much like a regular book and making choices using commands from the Braille keyboard or simply via the touchscreen. Similar games once graced book and game stores everywhere in the world of sighted fun seekers. Called gamebooks, they weren't read cover to cover. Instead, a paragraph or two would be read before the player needed to make a choice and turn to a page elsewhere in the book. Many of these were quite complex, requiring the use of dice, pencil, and paper to keep track of statistics. At last, this same experience is available to us with the added bonus of your iOS device doing the work of keeping track of things for you. Pages and numbered paragraphs are replaced by simple links that you double tap on to make choices.
Choice Of Games:
The Choice Of Games library is a collection of interactive story games that all make use of the same underlying system. Some stories are available free of charge. Others must be bought. Regardless, the same process of making an in-app purchase is used to unlock the stories and add them to your library. Choice Of Games LLC are the developers of the game system and use the "Choice Of" brand for games in this app. The games included are consistently of good quality. Often, they command fairly high prices compared to other games of a similar type. The developers license their system to third-party authors through an off-brand app called Hosted Games. These games all use the same core system, but the games found in Hosted Games vary widely in terms of quality and style. For the purposes of this guide, we'll examine a game from the Choice Of Games library. I will presume that you have read about the app store and feel comfortable making purchases.
The Superlatives: Aetherfall:
This is a highly rated game in the collection. Many of these games cross genre lines. This one would fall into the "steampunk" category, where history is altered by advanced gadgets powered by steam are commonplace. In this case, the power source is called "aether". The superhero genre is also invoked. You play the newest member of a society sworn to protect Britain and Earth from various threats. The game begins with a few paragraphs introducing you to the world. Your choices start immediately, as you need to decide how you've spent the night prior to the story. From the choices presented in the form of radio buttons, I select that I went on patrol with the police. After double tapping the radio button, I flick right and find the Next button. I double tap this to advance the story. I then select that I am a gentleman of superlative ability before flicking right and double tapping the Next button. I then select Spark as my nickname. Next, I pick Ingenious Inventions when deciding what my specialty is. I am rewarded with text describing my earliest invention, as well as the aether-powered wings I use to fly to the society headquarters. I double tap the Hurry Onward button to proceed into the story proper.
    The game proceeds in this manner, with each choice I make advancing the story. These games sometimes have some random elements, combat, and inventory management. However, the basic mechanics of making choices remains the same. I never have to worry about how long I take to decide something. Nothing happens until I make a choice. At any time, I can find a Show Stats button in the top left, just past the Back button. This will let me examine any statistics I have in the game and may also provide access to inventory or other things.
    There are four tabs across the bottom of the app. These are Store, Search, My Library, and Settings. The names are pretty self-explanatory. Take the time to explore each of these tabs. Some games in the store will be free or on sale. If you like this sort of game, it's a good idea to check in the store every so often. You can also receive notifications when new titles are added, which happens fairly frequently.
Frotz:
For people wanting a stiffer gaming challenge including more of a need to use VoiceOver's review capabilities, typing, or dictation practice, there's Frotz. This interpreter lets you download and play stories like the old Infocom adventure games such as Zork. There are hundreds of free games you can get from the interactive fiction database. Should you have copies of Infocom game files, you can actually transfer those to the Frotz app and play them. The app fully supports VoiceOver, which means you can play text games using a Braille display if you have one. Also, you can dictate your commands using the Dictate button found near the spacebar on the virtual keyboard. Double tap on the Input Command found at the bottom of the story text. The virtual keyboard should appear with the Dictate button. Try typing "help" if you're stuck. After typing or dictating a command, find and use the Return key. You may also use a Bluetooth keyboard to type in commands that way.
    There are literally hundreds of games you can play with the Frotz app. In 1999, I compiled a collection called Rising From Time's Ashes. It included games that I and others thought were the best interactive fiction available at the time. To give newcomers somewhere to start, I have included some descriptions of games that you can find and play from within the app. This is just the tip of a giant iceberg. You should be able to play any games written in either the Inform or TADS languages. Use the "browse the IF Archive" button and search for games to try in the TADS and Inform sections of the games portion of the archive. If you get stuck in a game, the archive also has many complete solutions to games. Also, there might be hints built into the games themselves which give you a nudge towards the way past puzzles you find difficult.
    Jigsaw: An Interactive History
    In Jigsaw, you start out at the dawn of the twenty-first century. It is New Year's Eve, 1999. You have been invited to the party at Century Park. There, you are attracted to a stranger, who vanishes into the crowds. He/she leaves behind a piece to a jigsaw puzzle. This turns out to be the doorway to a key moment in the past. The stranger, named Black, is trying to alter history to better our future. To save history as you know it, you must travel through time and solve a jigsaw puzzle, where each piece is a doorway to a key historical event in the twentieth century. Your journey will take you to the start of the first world war, the sinking of the Titanic, the first powered flight, and many more key events in the twentieth century. Can you save history as you know it? Is it right that you do so?
    Graham Nelson's second major work of interactive fiction is an absolute masterpiece. As well as offering its players vivid portraits of history with breathtaking attention to details, Jigsaw invites us to explore several moral issues. It is also the only game I've come across that goes out of its way to be completely gender-neutral. This game requires some knowledge of historical events, but its puzzles are logical and fair for the most part. The built-in help and documentation are quite extensive and well written. However, no hints are provided for stuck players. For those interested, footnotes are provided to each segment of the game that give historical information about the different events. They make for fascinating reading. Note that you must access these from within the Help menu. Players with some degree of experience with interactive fiction should be able to win this game without unreasonable frustration.
    To this day, Jigsaw remains one of my most treasured experiences with interactive fiction games. It took me around two years to finally win the game. I must confess to needing to resort to a step-by-step game walkthrough in a few places. More often, the help of friends proved sufficient to allow me past a puzzle requiring more knowledge of an event than I had. I enjoyed almost every minute of playing it. Also, I can honestly say that the game deepened my understanding and appreciation of history in a fundamental way.
    The Haunted Theatre: An Interactive Night of Horror
    In Theatre, you are a real estate agent trying to sell an old theatre. During your previous visit, you accidentally left your pager in the basement. You retrieve your pager and start to leave, only to discover that your car has been stolen, and a vicious thug blocks your exit. Your only course of action is to travel through the theatre and uncover its dark past while surviving its supernatural dangers and other obstacles. The past is made clear in the pages of the journal of a young architect who worked on the theatre and fell in love with the witch you must ultimately destroy.
    This game is especially good for beginners. Progressive hints for puzzles are available. It also comes with instructions and even a short story. Brendon Wyber has done an excellent job of designing this puzzle-filled game. Even experienced players should find this game entertaining, if not especially challenging. For older beginners, I usually recommend this game as a starting point unless they object to horror.
    Appearing while I attended university, I nonetheless found myself utterly absorbed and compelled to win the game. Over around two weeks, I played incessantly enough to have doubtless lost marks in my classes. Winning proved very satisfying indeed.
    A Bear's Night Out: An Interactive Children's Story:
    In A Bear's Night Out, you play the role of a cute and cuddly teddy bear who finds himself awake and aware. You must bravely explore the house that David, your owner, lives in. During your travels, you discover that a teddy bear picnic is going to take place. Can you find a way to get David to take you there?
    This game has been specifically written for young children, but people of all ages can appreciate the excellent writing and careful attention to details that has gone into it. Answers to many of the puzzles are not immediately obvious, but all puzzles are fair and logical, and hints are available in the help menu. With a small bit of help from kind folks who are older and hopefully wiser, children should thoroughly enjoy this warm and friendly game. I recommend this game for novices to intermediate players. Experts will still doubtless appreciate the craftsmanship this game exhibits, but may be disappointed with the mostly easy puzzles.
    Anchorhead: An Interactive Gothic:
    Having only recently married, you suddenly find yourself leaving behind everything you have known to move to your husband's family property in Anchorhead. This coastal town is a fairly gloomy place, and you quickly discover that sinister forces are at work in your husband's life. Your husband is quickly being drawn into something, and your very life depends on unravelling the mystery surrounding his family.
    This game won the 1998 XYZZY Award for best setting and was nominated for several others. Michael Gentry has produced a masterpiece of horror, which is apparently quite faithful to Lovecraft's writings. Reviews of Anchorhead described it as a masterpiece of horror. The writing was very well done and avoided many of the pitfalls commonly found in such games. Timing and pacing were excellent, and the game's player-friendly nature also drew favourable comment. The vividly horrific and perverse circumstances the game goes into make it absolutely unsuitable for younger players. The game deals with such subjects as rape, incest, and cruelty to children. In defence of the game, it does this with the intention of staying true to Lovecraft's style and subject matter. Clearly, the author does not condone these perversions.
    Christminster Abbey: An Interactive Conspiracy:
    Your brother's urgent telegram has brought you to the town of Christminster Abbey, where things are not as they should be. A conspiracy is afoot inside the halls of Biblioll College, and it turns out that your brother is somehow involved. Is he in danger? You must gain entry to the college and unravel the conspiracy to aid your brother. The town and university are full of interesting characters, and places are richly described. This is one of a growing number of games in which the player character is distinctly female. The documentation is excellent, and hints are available for desperate players. The characters are quite well crafted. I recommend this game for intermediate to expert players.
    So Far: An Interactive Catharsis:
    In So Far, you start in a theatre observing a play. This play mirrors your life in some respects, as it deals with a lover's betrayal. It seems your wife is having an affair. A strange breeze eventually lures you into the heart of a shadow buried inside an abandoned room within the theatre. You must journey to four strange worlds, and beyond them, in a quest to solve their mysteries and return home to find and possibly forgive your wife. Shadows become doorways, taking you to increasingly bizarre places.
    This game has often been compared to the popular graphical game called Myst. The worlds you will travel through various shadows to reach range in nature from the ancient to the bizarrely modern. The plot seems barely held together by various performances that must be seen. Many of the puzzles are fairly tricky. This game is for the expert player and rewards thinking outside the box.
    The Zork Trilogy:
    These three famous games were the first to be released by Infocom. They were the first to have the ability to understand sentences instead of merely two-word commands. Descriptions of all three games can be found below:
    Zork I: The Great Underground Empire: You are a bold adventurer who must gain entrance into the ruins of an ancient civilization and discover its treasures. A simple house in the woods hides the entrance within its walls, and also serves as a depository for any treasures you might be clever enough to find. From this deceptively mundane beginning, players journey into a world of rocky canyons, an underground river, a room from Atlantis, the land of Hades, into a forgotten temple, and across a solidified rainbow, and so much more. Your opponent in this first game is a cunning thief. He may appear at any time to snatch a treasure or two, some of which are needed to solve other puzzles in the game. Until most of the game is solved, you must try to keep your distance, avoiding confrontation. Then, long after he has driven you insane, and after you have made use of his talents, the tables are turned. You must hunt him down in his lair deep within a maze. There, you will enter into a duel to the death.
    When playing, keep in mind that all the puzzles in this game have logical solutions, even the seemingly random fights with the troll and the thief. The other fantastic monsters, including the vampire and the Cyclops, also have logical solutions to defeating them.
    Zork II: The Wizard of Frobozz: This begins where its prequel left off. You start in the barrow with the familiar sword and lantern resting by you. Taking up these adventurer's tools, you enter a second part of the underground empire. During your stay, you will visit caverns, a garden, a bank, and a land right out of "Alice In Wonderland". You will command a robot, open a seemingly impossibly fortified door, rescue a princess, fly into the heart of an ancient volcano, and much more. Your rival in this game is the wizard of Frobozz. Although prone to the occasional fumble, this meddlesome mage has some truly diabolical spells. The effects of some spells are quite amusing, if frustrating.
    While I played the game, I felt that almost anything was possible. The sense of being beyond reality is incredible. This time, logic doesn't have as firm a grip on things. My advice in most games is to stick to logic. Only when all else fails should you try anything out of the ordinary. In this game, however, this approach won't work. Try anything at all, no matter how ridiculous it seems. Anything is better than being reduced to the shame of looking at the solution, except, of course, being stuck at a hopeless point for all eternity. You may notice that this game seems to flow a bit smoother than the first one. Things seem less rugged, at least to me. The world seems a bit smaller, if not more understandable. Unless you are really good at creative thinking, you may find Zork II exceedingly hard. Despite this, you should still enjoy the scenery. It is even better described than the scenery of the first game. For information concerning documentation and hints, see the description for Zork I: The Great Underground Empire. Due to the more intuitive rather than logical nature of the game, I must rate this game at an intermediate level of difficulty. I would still urge novices to explore the masterfully crafted environment. You can prevail with a bit of patience.
    Zork III: The Dungeon Master: The last part of the journey through Zork is the smoothest, best written of the three. While there are none of those bothersome mazes to worry about, there is something even worse. It is called the royal puzzle, and it lives up to its name. It is very hard to fix things if you make a mistake. It took me days to solve that thing. Each wall you push will affect others. The object is to get the ladder under the hole. I strongly recommend saving the game before starting this puzzle.
    Aside from the royal puzzle, I found the rest of the game to be spectacular. The descriptions and plot are marvellous, as is the conclusion. Once again, Infocom presents a game that seems to take the player to the ends of the universe. From the bottom of the endless stairs, you travel to an underground lake, across an aqueduct, through a royal museum, and through time itself. All the while, the dungeon master tests you in his many guises. You meet face-to-face after trials of all sorts near a fiery inferno.
    Besides having the greatest scope, this game seems to be the most logically laid out. For the most part, navigation is fairly easy. The only possible exception to this is the Land of Shadows. That place can get a bit confusing. Perhaps, this logical organization is what makes the game seem smaller than it is. Like the other two games in the Zork trilogy, I found it difficult to rate this game. I'll put it to you this way: If you can handle the other two Zork games, you should be able to manage the final chapter in this saga. Intermediate to expert players should find this game quite challenging.
    Although the Zork trilogy is still given its due as historically important, it has suffered from neglect and comparison to what has come after it. Essentially, a collection of puzzles and treasure-hunts, Zork is now considered a fun sort of rite of passage for players. I very much enjoyed all three of these games and will doubtless revisit them in the future many times.
Inspired Work:
I lack the programmer's ability necessary to actually create the kind of text adventure game that I'd want to. However, during my days studying English literature in university, I took a creative writing class. During that time, I came up with the following poem inspired by interactive fiction. I got a high mark plus praise from fellow students. In 2007, Zork had its thirtieth anniversary. I sent this poem to a popular site for interactive fiction fans which wanted written submissions. The response from people who read it was quite favourable. I offer it here as a kind of Easter egg for my loyal readers:
    Within An Old White House
    by Michael Feir
    I sat before my great machine, and gave a woeful sigh,
    Countless icons filled the screen, but none would catch my eye.
    Each icon ran a game I owned, from Doom to Daggerfall,
    But none of these could rescue me, for I had won them all.
    My case was grave and serious, since I could not afford,
    To purchase any other games and keep from being bored.
    My bank account was empty and my credit cards all maxed,
    Any game worth paying for would be so steeply taxed.
    Desperately, I donned my helmet, and got upon my bike,
    And aimlessly, I rode along the paths where others hike.
    Within the woods, I lost my way, far from the beaten trail,
    Darkness neared, then stars appeared! My legs began to fail.
    Fearful of the woods at night, I slowly peddled on,
    Searching for a sheltered site where I could rest till dawn.
    I came upon a small white house, its entrance boarded closed,
    With all my might, I could not pass the obstacle they posed.
    To have safe haven near at hand with access thusly blocked,
    Was very hard for me to stand, With helpless rage, I rocked.
    I paced in fury around the house, and hadn't gone too far,
    When all at once, fate smiled on me, A window swung ajar.
    With ebbing strength I forced it wide enough to clamber through.
    A kitchen lay around me with its table set for two.
    Physically exhausted, I collapsed into a chair,
    An older man walked in and took the other that was there.
    "I don't get many visits," Said the hermit with a chortle,
    "Eccentricity compelled me to board up their standard portal."
    "Rest here, my weary traveller, Feel free to help yourself."
    He motioned to a bunch of tasty food upon a shelf.
    We ate and talked of many games, our claims to private glory,
    Of reality's far too frequent stings, and of my tragic story,
    He conversed with great intelligence, in a diction quaint and kind,
    His thoughtfulness would always be engraved into my mind.
    At length he rose up from his place, and headed off to bed,
    First showing me a couch where I could lay my weary head,
    I rested well that starlit night, but had some freakish dreams,
    Of darkened realms deep underground, explored by lantern beams.
    My brass lamp shone on wonders, an many terrors too,
    My ears took in a dragon's roar, and the gurgles of a grue!
    I walked across a rainbow, above a waterfall,
    And ballooned up a volcano's core, behind an icy wall.
    Waking from my dreams, I was quite startled through and through,
    To discover that a part of them seemed absolutely true!
    I looked around the living room, and as the hermit snored,
    I saw a trophy case, a rug, a lantern and strange sword!
    And as the morning sun came up, bestowing warmth and light,
    The hermit came with rueful cheer and asked about my night.
    I told him all that I had dreamed, and requested he explain,
    This world that I had visited, so full of joy and pain.
    He moved aside the oriental rug upon the floor,
    I gaped in disbelief when this revealed a closed trapdoor.
    I helped him heave it open, since the effort made him frown,
    He took the lantern from its place, and with me ventured down.
    The cellar in which we found ourselves brimmed with forgotten junk,
    Amid the mess, the man possessed a rusty iron trunk,
    I helped him hoist the tarnished box into the living room,
    He opened it with care and took its contents from their tomb.
    The old computer he unveiled was piteous to behold,
    I would have laughed had he not shown it reverence due to gold,
    He plugged it in and turned it on, Its screen was black and white,
    Its ancient disks could not hold more than half a megabyte.
    "The tale I have to tell you happened in the recent past,"
    "There was a firm whose every game was intricate and vast,"
    "For years they were successful, and proceeded with aplomb,"
    "But I doubt you've ever heard of them, for they were Infocom."
    "Zork was where you were last night, They made that universe,"
    "It inspired many gleeful shouts, and many a-vengeful curse."
    "Just give me half a moment, and I'll show you what I mean,"
    "These days what you will shortly view is all too rarely seen."
    He put a disk into the drive, and entered a command,
    And while the system worked he placed a book into my hand.
    My fascination grew quite strong as I began to find,
    Details of the fantastic place which occupied my mind.
    I closed the book and found that I was thoroughly ignored,
    The world could end, but he'd still bend before that old keyboard,
    My anger quickly cooled and gave me cause for private shame,
    Our ages were quite different, but our passions were the same.
    Despite my small deduction, I still felt rather vexed,
    When I looked to see my dreamscape and discovered only text!
    "Take the very best in modern sound and animation,"
    "And what is there will not compare with your imagination."
    Doubtfully, I played his game, My choice was quickly made,
    I had to find more of these games so rare and seldom played,
    I almost asked the hermit why this company had died,
    But the answer cut me to the bone before I even tried.
    These pioneers were swept aside by new technology,
    Graphic games won market shares for their simplicity,
    Time turned its page upon this age of thought-provoking fun,
    And Pac-man's maze became the craze obsessing everyone.
    "The look upon your face tells me you've understood my story,"
    "You comprehend what caused the end of Infocom's brief glory."
    "But don't despair, Just be aware they've left a legacy,"
    "Their games have been preserved upon the Masterpiece CD!"
    "And if you can't afford to buy a copy of it yet,"
    "Loyal fans have made new games and placed them on the Net!"
    "And though their works are gratis, they are to a large degree,"
    "Free from major glitches, and quite high in quality."
    "Return now to your youthful life with my earnest benediction,"
    "And do be sure you search the web for interactive fiction."
Word and Puzzle Games:
As one would expect, games about words tend to be very popular among blind players. The games about words typically don't need a lot of adaptation to make them accessible. They also tend to be popular with sighted players wanting something which doesn't demand lightning reflexes. So are various puzzles. These games tend to have a lasting appeal. Another advantage is that they often aren't as complex to program and can remain viable even without constant maintenance updates from their creators. In this subsection, we'll briefly cover a number of these kinds of games. Simply search for the name of a game you're interested in using the app store. Keep in mind that despite less technical effort being typically required to keep these games viable, some of them may still reach a point where developers decide to pull them from the app store rather than continue to support them.
7 Little Words:
Almost from the start, this particular game has been a continuous favourite and has remained fully accessible using VoiceOver. The object is to order a set of tiles correctly to form seven words that are somehow related to each other. Each tile contains one or more lettres. Each of the seven words has its own clue, but all words are made from the same collection of tiles. A tile can only be used once in a puzzle. There are fresh free puzzles available each day. Additionally, there are puzzle packs available for purchase, offering themed puzzles as well as puzzles designed to be easy, moderate, hard, or "impossible". At this point in the game's unusually long life, there is enough content to keep any wordsmith happy and busy for ages. New puzzle packs are introduced regularly. Every so often, new economic models are introduced, such as one that gives unlimited access to all puzzles on a monthly basis. Hardcore players may find this a better option than purchasing puzzle packs individually. On the other end of the spectrum, many players are thrilled just playing the freely available daily puzzles. There's never any nagging or pressure to purchase puzzle packs. The game is updated very frequently, with bugs fixed and new puzzles added. You'll never run out of word challenges.
Ordet:
In this game from La Nausé, each level features a group of words that use the same seven letters. Finding longer words yields more points. You submit words via the keyboard found at the bottom of the screen. Double tapping the letters on the letter bar near the top will remove them from your current guess and return them to the keyboard. Find all the words in a level to proceed to a new one.
    This game has stood the test of time very well. It's far from the only word game on the block, but it remains popular among blind players and provides a good challenge. It is easy to control and should be suitable for all ages. There is an Ordet Lite version that you can try before purchasing the full Ordet app.
Four Down:
This app brings over forty crossword puzzles to your iOS device. The puzzles are fully accessible to blind players. As you flick right across the grid, you will hear the clue for the word you're on. Double tap on the text field to enter a guess. Despite not being updated in over five years, this app still works, bringing a total of forty-eight puzzles to blind enthusiasts.
Black Ink:
For people who want endless crossword puzzle solving fun, an app released in early 2024 might just set you up for life. The Black Ink app rose to fame on the Mac. However, Red Sweater, the developer, has released an iOS version and made it exquisitely accessible for blind users as well as people with other disabilities. Rather than being a collection of puzzles, this app is a crossword puzzle solving interface which can accept puzzles in the "Acrossright" format. There are numerous paid and free sources of these puzzles on the Internet. This includes the New York Times, which remains the gold standard of American crossword puzzles. The app can be used for free. However, paying for the pro subscription unlocks features including being able to check your answers for correctness in "most" puzzles. The app comes with a small library of puzzles which don't require a login to access. There are also links to popular American paid sources of puzzles. Provided you have accounts with these services, you'll be able to easily obtain puzzles for solving with Black Ink. You'll have to do the work of chasing down additional free or paid sources of crosswords in the Acrossright format yourself.
Black Box:
This clever game is available free in the app store, but has some optional in-app purchases. It won numerous awards, including for its accessibility for blind players. Basically, Black Box turns your iOS device into a series of puzzles. Most of these don't actually involve manipulating items on the touchscreen. The clues appear on the screen, but the puzzles involve different aspects and capabilities of your iOS device. If you get stuck, there are hints available in addition to the initial clues given for the puzzles.
    I hesitate to give anything away here and spoil a puzzle. However, perhaps, a simple one will serve as an example. Skip to the next third-level heading now if you want to avoid having a puzzle spoiled. Get the game and just start playing. Still here? Alright then. You've been warned.
    When you begin this puzzle, you hear the noise of numerous balls being dropped. You are also given the number of balls present. This changes slowly over time. Additional Balls might appear or balls might be taken away. The solution to this mysterious collection of balls is that they represent the power contained in the battery inside your device. Plug your device in so that it charges fully. That solves the puzzle. Think outside the box to solve the many puzzles in this unique puzzle game.
Diced:
In this free casual puzzle game from Agile Tortoise, you play on a five-by-five board. You must place dice in these squares in such a way that you create combinations of dice. For instance, you could have five matching dice in a row. Alternatively, you could have dice with the numbers from 2 through 6 or 1 through 5 in a row. When a combination is created, the dice disappear, scoring you points. If you take too many moves to create a combination, a block is placed on the board, making things even harder. Other than the value of the die you currently hold, you are given the value of the next die that you'll hold after the current one is placed.
    There are several things that sweeten this basic design. Wild dice can be worth any value. You start with three bombs that can be used to destroy dice around where they are placed, freeing space on the board. Three different game modes are available to suit different styles of play. All of this adds up to a marvellously flexible and replayable puzzle game. You'll also want to check out other apps by Agile Tortoise. This developer really cares about accessibility.
Super Tile Smash:
Get ready for a fun puzzle game rich in audio. In this game, you need to destroy matching tiles on a grid by tapping on a tile with matching ones connected to it. In each level of the game, you have to destroy a higher number of tiles to move on. There are special tiles such as rockets, sidewinders, stars, and falling blocks to spice things up.
    While the core principle is simple, this game can become very challenging. It also features different modes of play to keep things interesting. Designed for players of any level of sight, this is a game you can enjoy along with sighted friends and family. There are many tile themes that alter the sounds used, as well as tile pictures. Sighted gamers have enjoyed casual puzzle games like this for years, so I'm glad to see them made available for blind players on iOS.
Phia Demsma:
If you're seeking fun ways to teach young kids how to do VoiceOver gestures, this app developer has created several educational games. These make use of a common set of friendly characters from Ballyland to take children on stories which involve using VoiceOver gestures to make progress. One of the latest offerings from this source is Bally Land Magic Plus. A big magic show is to take place in Ballyland, and it's up to the players of the game to make certain that everything turns out well. Kids will learn how to make one or two finger taps and three finger swipes, among other gestures.
    Other apps created by this developer focus on different skills. I was pleased to find that one of the games, Ballyland Rotor, is totally focused on teaching children how to make those gestures. In the game, the rotor must be used to control the outcome of a copter flight through Ballyland. Kids will learn how to turn the rotor as well as select options. Other games created by this developer focus more on teaching about outer space and other things in addition to VoiceOver gestures. Educators and parents of blind children may want to look through the various games Phia Demsma has created. Some of them are now at least four years old. I would advise people to check to see when the last update to these apps was released. Anything updated within the last couple of years is most likely still working splendidly. However, older games may not perform as well.
Voice Controlled Games:
The advent of smart speakers and personal assistants which can listen for and respond to our commands has led to the increasing popularity of voice controlled games. Making these available on tablets and smartphones has begun to happen. These games would be easy for beginners to play since they don't even require VoiceOver to be used. Once they're running, and you've dealt with any registration or permissions needed for the app to work, you won't need to use VoiceOver at all. Voice controlled apps will certainly need permission to use your microphone. Depending on the game complexity and other advancements, they may need other permissions. This area of entertainment is still in its pioneering days, and there's lots of room for clever ideas.
    Wanderword is a pioneer in this space. It has created several very ambitious games designed to be played entirely by listening to your voice and returning audio feedback. This makes their games fully accessible to blind players who can hear. These games feature clever puzzles, statistics, random chance and branching stories with multiple endings. They also have sound effects and music. One interesting decision they've taken is to use various synthetic voices rather than voice actors. This drastically reduces production costs and gives game creators inexpensive flexibility if changes to scrips are necessary. Most of their games are available on Google and Amazon smart speakers.
    Recently, they have released a tool called Fabella. This is designed to allow people to create complex interactive audio experiences for use on smart speakers, tablets, and smartphones including iOS and Android devices. As a test and demonstration of this system's capabilities, they have released The Bard's Tale: Warlocks of Largefearn on iOS and Android. The apps themselves are free to download, but unlocking the full game is done through an in-app purchase costing $6.99 Canadian as of March 2022. A starter pack of gold coins and healing potions is also available. This pack makes the first part of the adventure somewhat easier. It certainly made the difference between successfully completing the first quest on my first attempt and ignominious defeat at the hands of goblins. To be brutally honest, my character was actually unconscious when my badly injured companion struck a victorious blow. Yours truly is not the best player of games like this, despite deep enjoyment of them.
    The game is totally playable by voice. However, on tablets and smartphones, there are buttons which provide an alternative method of issuing commands. This is fortunate since there are occasions when the microphone stops listening, and you must use a button to start that happening again. I recommend the "look around" command since it doesn't cost you an action in the game. When you're dealing with voice commands, misunderstandings do occur. My command to "attack" was somehow misconstrued as a command to "move back" at one particularly critical point during combat.
    The sound and music do a lot to draw you into the story. From the creaking of a ship to the dripping water in an underground cave, if feels like you're the lead character in an audio drama. The music is also well-chosen. For people with sight, there is a lot of hand-drawn art in the game depicting characters, locations, and combat. Objects in various places can be interacted with far more than in other voice - controlled story-driven games. The combat system is also a cut above what one might expect. Position is a basic but important factor. So is your choice of companion, since only one may join in combat with you.
    One bane of existence for audio games of all stripes is economic viability. Sadly, we've seen a number of superb audio games designed for everyone to play pulled from the app store by their developers when maintaining them proved too costly. Wanderword's choice to tap into the growing number of high quality synthetic voices rather than using actors might just tip the scales and give staying power to games like Bard's Tale: Warlocks of Largefearn. It gives me great pleasure to see a time-honoured franchise like The Bard's Tale be brought to life in such an accessible way for blind players. I've very hopeful that more game will be forthcoming from Wanderword. The Fabella creation tool they've made available to anyone wanting to create audiobooks and games might also be accessible to blind creators. To learn more, visit:

Trivia Games:
You'd think there would be plenty of accessible trivia games around. Strangely enough, there aren't. A very popular one called Trivia Crack was very successful for years. Popular among blind and sighted players, the developers went to some lengths to make the game accessible for blind players. However, its time on the app store seems to have come to an end. Nothing has come along to replace it which is known to be accessible.
    As of early 2024, the only trivia game that I'm aware of is called Brave Brain. It is made for sighted people as well as blind players. It is free to play, but there are in-app purchases you can spend money on. None of these are at all necessary.
    The world forms the game board for Brave Brain. Players spend coins to go on expeditions to different countries. Each country has three locations where there may be quizzes to be taken. You spend coins to take quizzes and will win coins based on your correct answers and speed. There are also stars to be earned for completing expeditions to countries. These can unlock character portraits.
    The quizzes rely totally on VoiceOver rather than being read out by a human voice. You need to flick right to read the questions and reach the answers. Double tap on an answer to select it.
    You play the game as a single player experience. However, there are leaderboards, so people can compare how they do against other players. This game was built to be supported by ads. You can earn coins by listening to ads. It makes for a fun trivia game which need not drain your bank account to do well in.
    Until someone creates more trivia games which make use of more of your iPhone's resources, your best bet for finding more trivia enjoyment would be to go online and look for web-based trivia sites and forums. This is certainly an underserved area of popular entertainment.
Blindfold and Ears Games:
Type "kid friendly software" or even just the word "Blindfold" into the app store search field, and you'll come across Blindfold Games. These games are programmed by Marty Schultz, who took a keen interest in developing games for blind people using iOS. Working with feedback from blind students and other interested parties, he has come up with a unique gesture-based menu system and control scheme that can be found in all of his games. This greatly reduces the learning curve, leaving the user free to master whatever the actual game that has been chosen rather than its interface.
    Over time, Marty is rebranding the games to "Ears" rather than "Blindfold". He is also branching out into a more educational game direction with his Objective Ed software for use with schools teaching students with disabilities.
    There are over fifty titles in the Blindfold Games and Ears brand games so far. The games all use similar gestures and feature-spoken help and instructions. They are easy for beginners to pick up and start playing. Titles include Pinball, Wild Card, Breakout, Travel Cards, Racing, and many more. Games tend to be simple overall and are either card/puzzle games, games relying on ball physics like Pool and Pinball, or other simple matching or word-guessing games. The developer, Marty Schultz, is quite eager for any feedback or suggestions. His games are free to try, but you can purchase upgrades, including unlimited play, if you find a game you especially like or want to support future efforts. So far, these games have held up well despite the changes to iOS. However, Marty's attentions are now spread across more apps and his greatest priority is the educational side of his efforts. If issues crop up in his older games, he may not be able to address them as quickly as he once could.
    Beginners will especially benefit from this wide and varied range of relatively simple, family-friendly games. They are good for developing hearing, hand coordination, and memory skills, among many other skills. More veteran gamers may find them to be rather tame and simplistic. They shouldn't go in expecting games comparable to what their sighted friends are engaged in using the latest consoles. Blindfold games don't typically demand arcade level reflexes or rapid complex thinking. They're good, clean, simple fun.
    Marty is one of the most prolific but controversial developers of accessible games you'll find in the app store today. He has made a serious attempt to actually earn a living creating games and discovered how brutally hard that is, especially when developing for a niche market. When Apple revamped the app store and encouraged developers to consolidate their similar apps into one app, Marty resisted doing this. At the time, he had well over sixty apps in the app store, many of them similar, such as card games. Consolidating them would have been a monumental chore for one person and wouldn't have offered any economic return for all the effort. Also, Marty was worried that new games added to these consolidated apps wouldn't be discovered as readily. Many in the blind community felt that Marty shouldn't have been given an exemption to the new policy. This would have resulted in his shutting down and the loss of all of his titles from the app store. Personally, I'm rather glad he got that pass. His games and the standard system of gestures he has developed are easy for beginners who are just starting to use their iOS devices. Only a few of his titles hold any lasting interest for me. I favour more complex games for the most part, and have often wished that Marty would take things further than he ultimately does. A prime example of this is the Blindfold Pinball game I discuss below in the next subsection. It's a wonderful basic game and proof of concept. However, for Marty, the effort he puts in has to be economically worth doing. He has a lot on his plate, and I can appreciate how thinly stretched his time and energy are.
Audio Games:
With the computing power in your iOS device, it is possible to create quite sophisticated games that use sound as their chief method of output. Players can control the action with their voice, through a set of gestures, or by holding, tapping, and tilting their devices, etc. We've seen some of the best audio games ever created disappear from the app store due to the inability to justify the cost of keeping them updated to work as the iOS operating system changes how it handles sound. These games were well advertised, perhaps too low-priced, and had famous actors doing voice work. Despite all those advantages, they simply didn't sell enough. Keeping them working on successive versions of iOS would cost too much for too little return on investment. They have sadly disappeared from the app store. I'll never forget standing in the basement of a burning house in the game Papa Sangre II. The sound design was incredible. As you physically turned your body while holding your device, your perspective on the surroundings changed as it would in real life. Tapping the bottom corners let you move forward, trying to follow a scared house-cat to the exit, thereby escaping the fire. Wooden beams would come smashing down right behind you or crush you if you didn't move fast enough to avoid them. It was glorious auditory fun, the like of which we may never see again.
    Rather than tease you with wonders from the past, I'll cover some audio games below that have so far stood the test of time and grim app store economics. The market for audio games is, unfortunately, a small one, so I included the example above to encourage you to enjoy what you buy, lest it disappears before you can do so. The more complicated an audio game is, the more vulnerable it is to being broken by changes in iOS having to do with how audio is handled.
Ryft: A Timely Manner:
This game puts you in a strange house which seems to be outside of time. It is essentially an interactive fiction adventure game which uses artificial intelligence to understand your commands. You can either speak your commands or type them. The game responds by informing you what happens as a result. There are no time limits. A human narrator speaks the story to you and acts out the parts of various characters in the game.
    This game is especially good for beginners. Instructions are provided. Also, there are extensive hints. This is the first part of what will hopefully be an ongoing series. Players have so far enjoyed this game, but some have thought it too short. Also, once the puzzles have been solved, there is no replay value. Donations are accepted, but the game is free to download and play. The game was created by Justin and Alex Lerman and is their first release.
Blind Drive:
This game nearly won an Apple Design Award in 2021. It is a black comedy meant for mature ears. You play Donnie, an ordinary guy trying to make a fast buck by participating in a scientific experiment before joining his grandma for dinner. Sadly, it seems like everyone else has different, far more sinister plans. Using your ears and your hopefully quick reflexes, you must drive blind to survive. You're blindfolded and handcuffed to the wheel of a car, which keeps accelerating as you desperately try to steer past other cars and achieve other objectives. Getting through the game's multiple levels involves escaping police, contending with gangsters, and much more. Even dolphins are involved. The story is told through fully voice acted cut scenes in between and sometimes during levels of play.
    The controls are elementary. You can tilt your device left or right to turn the car. Alternatively, you can tap on the left or right side of your device held lengthwise between your hands. Double tap in the upper-left corner to pause the game and get to a menu of options. Double tap on the upper-right side to skip cut scenes and dialogue you've heard before. That's all there is to it. Easy to play but hard to master given the excellent sound design.
Evidence 111:
This is an interactive audio thriller where you play as a female British police officer who is being blackmailed due to a mistake made in her past. She must bring an evidence file to a hotel on an island to avoid unpleasant consequences. This game stars Zoe Robins, Rosamund Pike, and other actors. You make choices using a simple series of swipes on your iPhone. The game was made to be accessible for blind players and features very high-quality surround sound. As of February 2024, the game hasn't been updated in the past ten months. It is unclear whether any further updates are planned. However, a single payment is required, and the quality is exceptional. There are a number of different possible endings to the story depending on the choices you make so there is a degree of replay value.
Ears Pinball:
The ball bounced off the top bumper causing an electronic beeping in the centre of the stereo field projecting through my EarPods, scoring many points. It initially angled left but struck a bumper along the left side, changing direction, and sped across the centre of the table. I got ready to activate the right flipper. The fast countdown from three to one began, indicating the ball was in range of my flipper but also in increasing danger of falling down the hole and out of play. I tapped the bottom-right corner of my iPhone as the countdown reached one. That was a very close call, but my flipper was fully powered and struck hard, sending the ball upward and left to strike and bounce around bumpers before zooming through a side tunnel on the left. I had to act quickly to catch it with my left flipper, or it would fall out of play.
    And so, the action continues in one of Marty Schultz's masterpieces, Blindfold Pinball. This uses the touchscreen and audio capabilities of your iOS device to bring simplified but fun pinball action to blind players everywhere. While you won't find the same level of complexity that would be present in modern ordinary pinball tables, the basics of pinball action are wonderfully realized. As a veteran, more hardcore gamer, I find myself wishing Marty had taken things further regarding complex objectives and missions. However, for the purposes of an introductory audio game experience, Blindfold Pinball squarely hits the sweet spot of challenging but easily comprehensible fun. You can become used to tapping quickly and in time to score points. There is ample documentation and help provided, as well as a wide variety of available sound packs.
Sonar Islands:
For their second foray into accessible gaming, Mental Home EU had combined resource management with casual arcade action. In the future, wealth is contained on virtual islands. These are of different kinds, including jungles, temples, fairgrounds, machine shops, and others. Sonar Islands puts players in charge of an island. As the game progresses, players unlock new and different islands. The basic idea is to build up your own islands while attempting to steal from other players. As players build up their islands and unlock new ones, they gain experience, which increases their level. This in turn lets them upgrade their islands even more. Players can teleport to islands of other players and attack them. Once this happens, players need to quickly explore and retrieve the treasure on the enemy island and escape through the exit before time expires.
    Mental Home EU, the developers of Sonar Islands, have spent two years working on this title. Receiving some initial funding to help produce the game, they found that no organizations would offer any financial help to finance further development and the costs of running a multiplayer game like this. It therefore falls on hopefully happy players to make this viable over the longer term. How well this works will determine whether we see more games from this developer. They view blind people and audio enthusiasts as a special audience and have learned from other audio games which have been pulled from the app store due to unsustainable financing. The paid subscription they charge for full continued game access should hopefully pay the costs to run the multiplayer server and develop more different islands to expand the game over time. It is their attempt to be as fair about it as possible. Players can pay a monthly or annual subscription as they choose.
    In addition to the subscription, there are other in-app purchases available. You can spend real money on virtual diamonds. These aren't necessary to play the game. However, they can be used to start upgrades you don't have enough gold coins for or make upgrades finish rather than wait for the time upgrades take. Patient players can just keep gathering gold coins and never need to buy diamonds. However, doing so will also help support the game and encourage the developers to put effort into improving it or developing additional titles.
    Basically, islands have obstacles and treasure chests. Let's take a temple as an example. The obstacles in a temple are snakes and collapsing ceilings. Players will face these obstacles when they attack your temple. You can make things harder by upgrading these obstacles, increasing their levels. Each time you upgrade the snakes in your temple, another snake is added, which players must avoid. This makes it harder for players to steal the treasure chests and escape before running out of time. You can upgrade the treasure chests on your island so that they produce gold coins faster and can hold more coins for you to collect. You need to regularly visit your islands and empty the treasure chests of gold to add it to your overall wealth. Thankfully, you don't need to worry about the obstacles when collecting treasure from your chests.
    To upgrade your island, you interact with a menu to implement decisions on what to upgrade. This is also true when it comes to collecting gold from your treasure chests. Menus are easy to navigate. Flick left or right through options and double tap on what you want. This either opens a new menu with choices, or simply causes what you want to happen. There's always a "close"option in a submenu if you would like to get back out without selecting a choice. You're never trapped anywhere.
    There are a couple of ways to attack another player's island. The first is to double tap on the item with the number of attacks you have available. You can only have up to five at a time, and you gain back an attack every half hour. If you've been attacked by another player, you are allowed one revenge attack. If you choose to do this, you'll be given an opportunity to attack one of the player's islands, but can't choose which one. Your only options are to go through attacking the island presented or go back to the main menu, forfeiting your revenge opportunity. The other way to start an attack is to double tap on the "attack an island" option. You must pay some gold coins for a searching fee. An island owned by a player who isn't online or being attacked will be found and displayed. You'll get a briefing on the island. This includes what type of island it is, which player owns it, the level of obstacles on the island, and how much treasure is present in the number of treasure chests on the island. You can either attack this island or conduct another search, spending more gold coins hoping for a better target. You can't decide to attack a certain player other than by searching until he or she comes up randomly, so it's impossible to continue attacking the same player.
    Once you've decided to attack, you're teleported to the island. You'll hear the soundscape of whatever kind of island it is. You have around four minutes to move through the environment, retrieve the treasure by stepping on treasure chests, and escape with your treasure by reaching the exit. You can turn around and move forward by tapping the screen to move a step in the direction you're facing. There are a few different methods to choose from in the game settings regarding how to turn. I like the rotor method, but you can swipe or tilt your device if you prefer. The sounds of obstacles and treasure chests which make a tinkling sound will rotate around as you turn. You definitely need your EarPods or some kind of headphones to play the game. To deal with one kind of obstacle, you can swipe up the screen to perform a special move like raising your shield to protect against the falling pieces of ceiling in the temple. Other obstacles must simply be avoided, but might be able to make that harder by attacking you. Time keeps ticking down as you proceed around the area, trying to get the treasures and escape. You are given warnings when two minutes, one minute, and fifteen seconds remain.
    If you fall prey to a snake or trap, you will lose precious seconds and then reappear somewhere on the island with whatever time remains. It's always possible to avoid this if you're careful and quick to react. Some fates take up more time than others.
    If you escape the island by reaching the exit before time expires, you gain an amount up to ten percent of the player's gold coins. It depends on how many treasure chests you recover. You also gain lights. These lights are a measure of your playing skill. You gain them through successful attacks or from other players failing to succeed when they attack your island. You lose light when other players succeed in attacking your island or if you fail to complete an attack. When time runs out, you're returned to your islands with or without treasure and lights.
    There's a lot of help. Inside the app, there's a help and information option which gives advice and instructions. Also, there's a tutorial which new players need to complete before going to their islands. There's a training camp which lets you get the hang of moving around and collecting treasure. It also has information and descriptions of each kind of island. Players can visit www.mentalhome.eu and will find a series of videos from Newdeath Gaming which take you through aspects of the game. This is a great way of getting a sense of Sonar Islands and whether it's the kind of game you'd like.
    This game is family-friendly and doesn't provide opportunities to directly harass each other. You can't communicate with other players and only face the obstacles on their islands. There's a nice combination of complexity and ease of play. You never get bogged down in details, and the choices you make are meaningful ones. There's some real depth of strategy in how you choose to build up your islands and when to unlock new ones. Also, the arcade portion when you're attacking islands is easy to learn but hard to master. Things can get really intense as the clock ticks down, and you need to decide whether to try for that last treasure chest or play it safe and head for the exit. I also like how the environments are kept simple. You don't have to worry about getting lost in a maze or memorizing where things are. However, there are enough sound changes to give a sense of where you are. The game is well suited to casual play during short periods of spare time. Attacks only take four minutes, whether you win or lose. Also, you can pop in and make decisions about what to upgrade on your islands during a short break, and then get on with your day. This isn't one of those games which require long hours of play to get anywhere.
Audio Wizards:
This game is terrific casual arcade action fun. You are an apprentice wizard who must help defend your enchanted land from elemental demons. Use simple swipes to select and cast spells at your enemies. Some enemies require multiple hits to defeat them. Play well enough, and you'll gain a super spell that hits any attacker for a limited time. Otherwise, you must select the correct elemental spell to damage opponents. If a demon reaches you before you can destroy it, you will lose a life.
    There is a Story mode featuring a voice actor playing the part of your master wizard. This mode takes you from learning how to select and cast spells through a large adventure with numerous levels to complete. You will also find an Endless mode awaiting your pleasure. This is good for practicing your skills, so you're ready to conquer more difficult levels. Also, it's different every time, making the game replayable even after you've gone through the whole story. The game fully supports VoiceOver, which is used for starting play and making mode selections. It is suitable for all ages, and the gestures needed are simple ones. Winning the game isn't so simple, since things get faster the farther you get.
A Blind Legend:
Here's a game that is far grander in scope and offers more complex audio challenges. A game developer teamed up with Radio France to produce this fully accessible audio adventure game. It's still being updated occasionally and is free from the app store. You don't need to use VoiceOver to play the game. It requires headphones or earbuds and uses stereo sound. You play Lord Blake, a blind knight whose wife has been kidnaped by an evil king. You are led through the land on a quest to rescue her from the evil King Thork by the voice of Louise, the brave young daughter of Lord Blake. She provides you directions past obstacles. You can move around through using swipes and gestures on your device. Timing is often critical. You also need to fight enemies with your sword. You'll hear their taunts and attacks come from ahead, behind, the left, and the right. EarPods, AirPods or other headphones are essential to play this game.
    The developer of this game is eager for feedback. It has survived longer than I thought possible in the app store, for which I'm very thankful. It's such a good illustration of what's possible in terms of audio gaming. While you don't need to pay anything to fully enjoy this game, it is possible to purchase lives, so you don't have to wait for them to gradually recharge. That's one way to support this developer.
Knight Commander:
This second offering from Woodside Apps, the developer of Super Tile Smash, is a totally different strategy game, putting you in charge of a village where you must build defences and complete quests. You issue commands to the people in your tribe, either individually or as a team or teams. You must keep track of their health and energy while othering them to complete tasks. This can include everything from doing battle with enemies to constructing buildings to hunting and gathering resources. The game will announce happenings or else indicate them via sound. You control the game using simple gestures to interface with menus.
    Like other audio games, the clock is ticking as events unfold regardless of whether you make choices. You need to act quickly at times to prevent disaster from striking your village. Characters grow older and eventually die. I've gotten quite caught up in the life of the village as I've struggled to achieve more in the game.
Feer:
This game is what they call an "endless runner". Your character runs at an ever-increasing pace through a hostile world, trying to survive as long as possible. There is no ultimate victory. Just a continuing series of challenges. You hear the hazards and power-ups appear ahead, to the left, or to the right of you and must act fast. Duck ravens, jump over hands reaching up from graves, and dodge zombies. This is a very well-built game that is also enjoyed by sighted people, as there are some graphics.
    The game doesn't cost any money beyond the initial purchase price. However, it offers the chance to earn and spend "fairy lights", a kind of in-game currency, on upgrades to make your next journey easier. These upgrades might cause your power-ups to last longer, for example. You can also spend fairy lights on resurrecting if you are killed in the game. This is useful for completing more arduous quests.
Alt-Frequencies:
This is a science fiction thriller. You can listen into radio stations on what should be just another ordinary day in England. Britain is considering implementing a new technology that would cause time to loop small amounts into the past. This would allow for mistakes to be corrected, disasters to be averted, etc. However, there was supposed to be an election to decide whether to flip the switch or not. It appears that the time loop technology may have been activated without public consent.
    You can listen to a number of different stations. To move forward through the story and solve the mystery of what's happening, you can record media from one station and send it to another broadcaster's show. Doing this can change what happens as people react to the items you broadcast. The trick is to cause enough memorable attention to be drawn to what's happening prior to the time loop being encountered so that you can move farther along in the story.
    Use simple gestures to switch between stations. When you hear something useful, swipe down to record questions or other samples from what you're hearing. Next, switch to another station and swipe up at the right time to interject your sample or question into the current show. This will cause reactions among the broadcasters and listeners, leading to new consequences. The sound work in this game is superb, and the mechanics are straightforward. Finding the correct path through the story is something else entirely.
    The sound and voice acting in this game are splendid. The mechanics are fairly simple even for beginners, making this an excellent game to start with. There are some intense scenes and the odd bit of bad language, so I'd recommend this game for teens and above. As with most audio games, I recommend you wear headphones during play.
Audio Game Hub:
This small collection of games in a single app is another development worth checking out. You get eight audio games in the app, and they've just done a Kickstarter to fund games now being worked on for PC, Mac, and iOS. The first appearance after this Kickstarter was a game simulating Cricket as played by blind people called Blind Cricket.
    Unfortunately, it is unclear at this juncture whether anything is in development with Audio Hub. I haven't seen any news since at least a year before the first edition of this book was published in 2020. In all likelihood, this joint initiative has long since run its course.
Board and Card Games:
A flat tablet obviously lends itself well to digitized versions of board and card games. Of these, a small but slowly growing number are being made accessible to VoiceOver users. Players can feel the board on their touchscreen and hear what lies beneath their fingers. Double tapping on a piece in Chess or another board game involving pieces would indicate one's intent to move the piece. The player would then find and double tap on the area where the piece should be moved to affect this. Similar processes allow for the flicking through and playing of cards in one's hand.
    A nice aspect of most board and card games is that they allow for play between people either in the same location passing the device back and forth, or over the Internet between devices each having the app installed. These games are also typically widely familiar to people, even if they haven't played computer games before. Many innovative approaches are used by developers. In Backgammon with Buddies, the app can be used with the Messages app in iOS. Your moves are sent to your opponent as messages that then tie into the app. At that point, players would use the app to examine the board and make their next move, which is sent as another message. All very clever indeed.
    There are three settings in VoiceOver that are profoundly useful while playing board and card games. The first is having VoiceOver Hints enabled. In most contexts, these are short instructions such as "double tap to open" and other such sentences that help you know that is possible. Often, games will use this hint system to reveal information that you would otherwise have to more actively seek. You might hear cards similar to the card you're hovering on that are in your hand or that have been played. You might hear the status of a piece you're on or what the face of a die is showing. A lot of timely and useful information can be imparted through the VoiceOver Hints system. As an experienced user, I often disable the hints while I'm working. However, I always enable them while playing games. They accelerate the process, especially when app developers take the time to use them to their best potential.
    The other critically important setting to know about is Vertical Navigation. This is a setting you must point the rotor to. Rather than moving horizontally by character, word, or line at a time through a document or text on the screen, Vertical Navigation lets you move directly up or down without moving the column you're in. This lets you examine the column in a table, or lets you flick up and down to reach elements of an app's interface that are directly above or below each other. This makes it possible to examine a game board and move pieces. You can explore by flicking in all four directions, quickly getting a sense of where everything is.
    On the subject of the rotor, remember that many developers are using the ability to add custom rotor menus that become part of the main rotor while you're in a particular app. These can greatly facilitate making moves and quickly examining the board or state of play.
    Finally, there's the Direct Touch setting. This can be enabled in your rotor or in quick settings. Essentially, this setting gets VoiceOver out of the way, allowing you to control games which use their own accessibility gestures. While this can eliminate the need to turn off VoiceOver, some games with their own independently crafted accessibility may work better with VoiceOver turned off during play.
    The Unity accessibility plugin is already having a tremendous effect, as a game like Dawncaster, discussed above, amply demonstrates. I anticipate many more complex games, particularly if they are turn-based, being made accessible. This standardizes the gestures needed to explore the screen and interact with controls.
Wordvoyance:
If you're hankering for an accessible game like Scrabble, this is as close as you'll come to it on iOS. There's a board with squares very similar to a Scrabble board but somewhat smaller. Each player gets a collection of tiles and draws more to replace what's used each time their turn begins. The app developer, Themis Games, has gone to great lengths to make this game accessible to everyone. It is also cross-platform so you can play against people who use computers rather than iPhones to access the game. There's a tutorial, a manual, and other resources for beginners to help them get started and learn to control the game. It is also possible to play against an artificial computer opponent, so you can learn the basics and try out the game. If you want to play more than one game at a time, you can pay a subscription fee to unlock this capability and help support ongoing maintenance and development.
Chess:
There are a good number of accessible Chess apps. Many of them have stood the test of time well as iOS has upgraded over the years. Chess-wize, Pulsar Chess, and Shredder Chess are three notable examples in the app store. My geospatial skills aren't well suited at all for the advanced move planning needed to be a good player of the game. I will therefore leave it to wiser heads than mine to point people to "the best" of these apps.
    Shredder Chess:
    Shredder Chess has been in the app store for years and was recently updated in April 2020. It allows for online play against opponents or play against the Shredder Chess engine. It costs 5.49 Canadian in the app store. This app will serve as our example board game. Other Chess apps are operated in similar fashion, but may boast a different set of features.
    Once you launch Shredder Chess, you'll find the top of the screen taken up with the game board. If you're playing white, you'll find the squares from A8 through H8 right below the status bar. The white piece will be at the bottom. Below the board, you'll find information on the status of the game. This will include captured pieces, whose move it is, and other information. You will also find hint, Redo Move, Move, Disc, and Action buttons. At the very bottom, you'll find a series of five tabs. These are Play, which you start in, Puzzle, Rating, Info, and Settings. Other Chess apps will display a similar board and have other features in separate tabs. Having a full board displayed requires apps to have two or more tabs to deal with other features important to players.
    Once I've hit the Actions button and selected New Game, I can make my first move. Setting my rotor to Vertical Navigation, I touch near the bottom of the board on the screen, which is over halfway down. I end up on C1. Wanting to move my pawn at E2, I flick up once to reach row B and then flick right to reach the pawn at E2. I double tap on this pawn and then flick up twice to square E4. Double tapping on this square completes my opening move. The computer then makes its move, and this is announced by VoiceOver. You can then examine the board at your leisure as well as the information beneath it that will also contain the last move made.
    While the engine at the core of this game has been outperformed since its creation, it should be more than sufficient for beginners through to experts. You can set its level of competence along with a great deal else in the Settings tab at the far right. Those wishing to play different variants of Chess, such as Atomic chess or Crazy House, might prefer a more recent app called Pulsar Chess. This seems more geared towards play between human players, but also has a long-established Chess engine for play against your device. Both apps should be very suitable for beginner players to learn the game. Shredder Chess does have somewhat more available in terms of help.
Jiangfen Wu:
If you've ever wanted to play a strategy game with a large map and units to move around, there's a new developer who is going to great lengths to include blind players. I only just became aware of the games released by this developer in March 2022. So far, I've found a game which is a clone of Heroes of Might and Magic, a Civilization clone and one of Sim City. These are games I used to play with the help of sighted friends and family while I was growing up. They had to control everything, describe everything, and give me a chance to think my way through what I couldn't examine for myself. Now, with the efforts of this developer, it is possible to play versions of these games independently using VoiceOver. One can examine the map, select and move units, and choose options. Sound and music are optional. People who attempt these games should be skilled at using VoiceOver and expect some rough spots. Work is ongoing with these games, including improvements to VoiceOver support.
    I learned about this game via Applevis. My impression is that this developer has only very recently attracted the attention of blind people hungry for larger strategy games. Wu could be the next rising star of accessible games if enough people develop the skill with VoiceOver needed to enjoy these masterpieces.
Lost Cities:
This very special card game was designed by Reiner Knizia, a famous board game author. Compared to a two-player game of Solitaire, Lost Cities has a visual theme of going to ancient mythical places. While blind people largely miss out on the eye candy present on the playing cards, the game itself is wonderfully accessible. It includes a human narrated tutorial plus well-written rules to help people get started. There's no time pressure as the game waits patiently for your next move. Wait, long enough, and you can hear the music that people who don't use VoiceOver hear as they play the game. You can play against computer or human opponents.
    There are no tabs to worry about in this app. You start in the main menu of Lost Cities. Flick left and right through the options and double tap on what you want. First time players will want to look at the rules. For this example, we'll play a game against Ms. Lindenbrock. She's an artificial intelligence player, complete with simulated emotions and play style. I've won and more often lost a number of games against her. As a first move, she plays a "coin" in the white lane. There are five lanes in which cards are placed. There are five colours or suits of cards, and the "coin" cards are special, taking the place of number one. Each suit has cards from coin up to ten as the highest card. You need to play the cards in sequence from lowest to highest in their lane. You are allowed to discard a card rather than playing one during your turn. Each lane starts with a value of 0 points, but 20 points are deducted the moment you play a card. You therefore have to play enough cards to make up those 20 points for it to be worthwhile playing a lane. Coins are special. They must be used before any other cards are played in a given lane. Each coin multiplies the total points in a lane, so Ms. Lindenbrock now has a score of minus 40 points.
    I touch near the bottom of the screen below the lanes and discard piles. Flicking right through my current cards, I find that I have a red coin plus the 2 and 5 red cards. Playing the red coin seems like my best first move, since I can then play the 2 and hope for useful cards to be drawn in each of those turns. I double tap on the red coin, which selects it. I am then automatically moved to the Play button. I could still change my mind, opting for another card, but I'm certain of my move, so I double tap the button. I am then moved to the draw stack and can draw a new card. It turns out to be one of the yellow coins, which wasn't what I had hoped for. Ms. Lindenbrock then plays the yellow 4 card. The game continues in this fashion. There are sounds for cards being played and selected. You can feel the board at any time, discovering what cards are in which lanes. Also, thanks to the VoiceOver Hints system, you'll receive all the information you most often need during play simply by flicking through your cards. Lost Cities was developed by TheCodingMonkeys and costs $2.99 in the app store.
BitLife:
Very popular among blind and sighted players, this style of game attempts to simulate the decision-making aspect of life. Starting out as a child, you choose from a growing number of options and areas to focus on as your character ages through childhood into adulthood. Although you play as a single player, you can nevertheless take part in community challenges and ongoing discussions among players.
    There are a growing number of these games in the app store. Although they weren't originally designed to be accessible, developers have been quite responsive to blind players who found the largely text-based games to be somewhat accessible. Popular titles in this space include Life Simulation and a classic from the 1980s called Alter Ego, which is fully accessible to VoiceOver. By far, the most extensive, accessible, and continually popular of these games is called BitLife. It was created by Candywriter LLC and continues to be expanded and updated regularly. Although subsequent apps by this developer are graphical and not accessible, the developer has been very responsive to blind players and has made certain that BitLife remains accessible to VoiceOver users.
    Starting a new game, you can either let factors be random or flick right through various choices. The game uses standard form controls including pickers, buttons, etc. One thing to be aware of is that there are many popup windows. When you double tap on an area such as Activities, a window pops open that overlays other parts of the game. Before you can do something like go to another area of focus or reach the main menu, you need to close any such open windows by making a choice in them or finding the Close button that makes them disappear. This is a good app for learning how to use form controls and deal with something that wasn't originally designed to be accessible to blind players. Note your statistics near the bottom of the screen. These will change according to the choices you make. The thing that sets these games apart from roleplaying games is that there's no grand quest to solve. Games like BitLife are all about living through a simulated life and making of it what you wish to. To be successful in a job interview, you can help your prospects by improving your smarts stat as well as possibly your looks stat. To survive a violent encounter, your health, and strength scores come into play. Just like in life, how you spend your time matters. Relationships matter. The choices you make interacting with simulated people in your virtual life will have consequences over time.
Accessible Roleplaying Games:
There are many of these games available now. Interest in this genre is pretty reliable. Combining story with combat, character building and resource management, these games appeal to the adventurer waiting in all of us. There are a couple of well established long-running series. Namely, the Eldron series and the Adventure To Fate series. Both of these now include numerous titles. Each series has won at least one award for its games. They cast the player in the role of a central character in a branching story. Games from both series have sound and music to pull you into their stories. The differences show themselves in how you navigate their worlds, the mechanics they use for combat and other things, and how important puzzles and thorough exploration are to ultimate victory.
    More developers are wanting to include blind players in increasingly ambitious games designed for people with sight. As a result, those who want to create and control a party of characters in a quest to save the world are now in luck. A new series is emerging called Endor is emergin. Tfhere are now two titles: Depths of Endor, and Endor Awakens. Both are supported by ads but offer in-app purchases to get rid of them and gain other benefits. How entycing these games are to blind payers remains to be seen as they have emerged quite recently in 2025. The developer is eager for feedback to continue to improve accessibility.
    There are also a growing number of standalone games made by other developers. A game called Forgotten tells a sprawling story with relatively simple mechanics. meanwhile, another more recent game called Bardcard uses a Concentration style card matching game to turn its dungeon exploration into a memory exercise. Much easier than a map for some of us blind people to handle.. People wanting more should definitely visit the Applevis website and look in the games section of the iOS app directory. The Hosted Games app, discussed earlier, features a number of titles which are more rpg-like than simple choice-based stories.
A Dark Room:
This is a unique creation. Elements of the experience are timed. It is a text game with statistics, resource management, a map, and other complexities, but the author has made certain that it's all fully accessible through VoiceOver. After being made aware of interest from blind players, he has become a strong advocate for making games accessible where it's possible to do so. He built an alternative ending section of his game, so blind people could complete it.
    In addition to making good use of VoiceOver's Hint system, this game also contains bonus material recorded by the author that only blind players will find. If you enjoy A Dark Room, you may also like the prequel game called The Ensign that has a similar style.
Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind:
The Tandora clan wasn't off to the best of good starts. Having settled in a valley on the right bank of the Eel River, they were slowly building up their lands and defences. An attempt was made to finish building everyone's houses. Sadly, it ended in failure as cooperation broke down among clan families. A subsequent raid by trolls had exacted a stiff price from the clan, despite aid from another in the area in fighting them off. As the second year of settlement began, an effort to clear sufficient pastureland while everyone was still healthy seemed reasonable. To increase cooperation, the appropriate blessing was asked of the earth goddess Nyalda, and a shrine was built in her honour. This seemed to work as the attempt succeeded and the shortage of pastureland was seen to properly with minimal injury. Perhaps, with the shrine providing a permanent boost to cooperation, an attempt to finish building homes would succeed in the following year. Meanwhile, more warriors needed to be recruited, and a watchtower was built to aid in the defence of this still-fragile settlement. In this world thrown into disarray by an ongoing struggle among the gods, could the Tandora clan hope to thrive? Only time would tell.
    This was how a game of Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind began for me. In this game, you must make decisions on behalf of a clan of horse riders who have been forced to flee their city due to climate change caused by a war among the gods. Players must become familiar with the ways and highly developed mythology of Glorantha, the Bronze Age fantasy world in which the game takes place. Chance, learning the mythology, and risk management skills all play a part in this grand combination of a choose-your-own adventure gamebook and strategy simulation.
    Certainty is very fleeting as even poor choices can sometimes succeed, and even the best choices come with a chance of failure. Make choices for the characters who make up your clan and get to know their personalities as they grow older, more skillful, and wiser. The better you know your people and the cultural narratives and forces at work in their lives, the better you will do as a player.
    In addition to lessons in leadership and managing the consequences of one's choices, Six Ages is a stunning example of the kind of accessibility that is possible when developers think about it from day one and use the tools Apple has built into the operating system. The app developer has made extensive use of the VoiceOver Hint system, reducing the need to go looking for information. The exploration and map system has been simplified, so blind people won't struggle with that aspect of the game. All the decisions regarding exploration must still be made. The only change is that a system has been devised, so there's no need for blind people to deal directly with the map during the game. The map was a large hinderance to blind players attempting to play A Sharp's first game, King of Dragon Pass. This game is also accessible and worth checking out. However, Six Ages is a much easier game for beginners to dive into. This holds true for a new sequel game released after the second edition was published. Lights Going Out takes place as conditions are dire an it seems that the end of the world is at hand. You must guide your clan through the end times and perhaps, through some means, survive the coming end. Figuring out what values make sense at such a point in history is no small exercise in clan leadership.
    Besides easing aspects of map exploration, Six Ages features many other improvements, such as a deeper, more complex combat system. Nothing happens until the player makes a decision, so there's never any rush. Another welcome surprise was the inclusion of descriptive text specially written for blind players. This text is found after all the options and other text, but only appears to VoiceOver users. Different scenes and other works of art found in the game are described for blind players. Adding in these descriptions is an ongoing process, and more are found after each update. Six Ages: Ride Like The Wind and Six Ages: Lights Going Out are the first games in a planned six-game set that will allow players to see how their clan fairs over different periods of history in the world of Glorantha.
    The game can teach many lessons about leadership, consequences, risk management, and relationships. It also reinforces all kinds of skills, including swiping, double tapping, careful screen exploration, and other basic skills. It turns these activities into steps in an epic journey so full of other interesting aspects that you won't even realize you're mastering screen reader basics.
Accessible Online Games
There have been browser-based online games as well as multiuser dungeons for decades. Nothing at all stops blind people from playing these using their web browser or specially designed apps like MUDRammer. There are lots of these games around. Playing them is certainly a great way to become practiced at typing, reviewing the screen, and using form controls on websites.
    I'll leave it to you to find these games and learn to play them on your own. However, as starting examples, I would recommend checking out two browser-based games that have stood the test of time. The first is the oldest. It's called Sryth. Think of the gamebook style apps like Choice of Games, which I discussed above. Sryth is a lot like that, only it keeps track of everything. You just have to make decisions for your character. Sryth has continued to expand over the past seventeen years and is now absolutely massive. You play as a single player, but there are community contests and tournaments you can enter. The developer has done a great deal to make certain Sryth remains accessible to blind players, including using alt tags to describe pictures and maps. Find it at:
    www.sryth.com.
    You won't regret signing up for an account and joining the adventurer's guild. While the game can be played free of charge, it is possible to purchase resources to improve your character's fortunes and capabilities.
    Another excellent browser-based game for people more into science fiction than fantasy is called Tau Station. The developers of this adventure in the far-flung future were keen to have their game be accessible to blind users. This is what is known as a massively multiplayer online game, or MMO. Thanks to the accessibility work done on the game, blind players are on an equal footing with sighted players in the gigantic universe of choices and adventures. You can find it at:
    www.taustation.space
Storium:
Game available at:
    www.storium.com
    Free to play with limitations
    Pay what you want monthly or annually for membership
    What would inspire people to voluntarily write over two hundred and thirty million words worth of stories in four years? Storium is the answer. You pay what you want to play this unique game of shared creative writing.
    I was new to Kickstarter in 2014 and hunting for something interesting to try backing. I wanted something which wasn't physical that I might enjoy and which would potentially help other people in some way. I stumbled on Storium during one of my first searches and knew I had found something worth supporting. As things turned out, it was the first Kickstarter I backed which succeeded in reaching its funding goal. It was one thousand and five percent successful.
    Stories, writing, and wordplay have always been fascinating to me. The idea of turning creative writing into a cooperative game seemed like something which ought to exist. I could picture it helping people to truly enjoy reading and writing. Especially teens and young adults. If people can cooperate to tell better stories, they might better be able to extend that enhanced communication skill to other areas of life. It seemed like such a far out idea that I just had to back it and see if it ended up taking off.
    Storium combines creative writing with cards for a very unique experience. Basically, the playing cards aren't like a normal deck. There are different decks of cards which form worlds where stories can take place. Instead of suits and numbers, each card is an element of a character or story which fits the rest of the world deck and serves as an inspiration for creativity. Each character has a nature card which has a description of the character. There are also strength and weakness cards, asset cards, subplot, and goal cards among other kinds. Players write parts of the story on these cards when they are used during scenes in the game. At the end of a scene, players refresh their hand of cards, receiving new ones to replace what they used.
    There are three different roles for participants in Storium. Like other story-driven games, one player is called the narrator. Much like a game master in a roleplaying game, the narrator is in charge of the story. He or she plays different cards. These include place, character, asset, obstacle and other cards which facilitate creating scenes. These scenes are stocked with challenges and possibly rewards for other players. The role of narrator isn't carved in stone. It might rotate between players or be passed to a player by the host.
    Hosts don't get any special cards. They are responsible for inviting people to the game, settling disputes, and potentially passing the role of narrator to another player. They are in charge of keeping things convivial for all involved. Often, the narrator is also the host. Otherwise, the host is one of the character players.
    Other than the narrator, each player will control a character in the story. They will receive cards which help the character overcome challenges and progress through the story. Characters receive a hand of strength, weakness, and other cards which they can play against challenges set by the narrator within the current scene. Once a scene has been completed, players refresh their hands of cards before the next scene begins.
    Several decks are available free for players regardless of whether they have a paid membership. These are created by Storium staff and are designed to support any kind of traditional generic story. For example, there are decks for basic fantasy, science fiction, mystery, romance, etc. A major perk of paid membership is access to more richly detailed worlds. These special worlds were each crafted by professional authors and game designers for maximum storytelling fun. The cards in these worlds have more fancy artwork and feature characters, challenges, places and other things unique to those particular worlds. A lot of the money raised in the Kickstarter campaign went towards the creation of these worlds.
    Here's how a typical scene might play out. Let's say we're in the middle of an adventure story. Investigating a cave, we find an ancient artifact near the back of it. However, there's a chasm in the middle of the floor which needs to be crossed. A loud roar informs the group of players that a wild bear is also present in the cave and unhappy with your group's activities. The back of the cave where the artifact is happens to be very dark. The narrator sets out three challenge cards. The darkness, the bear, and the chasm to be crossed. Players would then decide which of their cards to play against each of the challenges. Each challenge has a number representing the difficulty of overcoming it. Each card played on a challenge reduces this number by one point. Strength cards push the resolution of a challenge towards a strong outcome which is advantageous to the players. Weakness cards push the challenge towards a weak outcome which still resolves the challenge but with outcomes less favourable to the players, possibly introducing new complications. Perhaps, a player decides to play a weakness card of being afraid of the dark. This would send the challenge towards a weak outcome. However, other players can play strength cards to tend towards a strong outcome for a challenge. Subplot cards can also be played which are neutral in terms of strength or weakness but still count as a point against the challenge total of cards needed. You need to play all of your strength and weakness cards before you refresh and get new ones, so finding places to use weakness cards is an important strategy. Players have to choose up to two cards to play in a move and then write what happens as they play their cards to support their narrative. For instance, they might play a "carries a lantern" strength card against the darkness challenge, reducing it by a point. If more strength cards are played against the darkness than weakness cards, a strong outcome is achieved. Perhaps, all the light will reveal more hidden treasure. When all challenges are overcome, the scene comes to an end.
    This game remains very accessible. The developers took the trouble to make their game accessible and encourage people to write descriptions for any art they use in their story cards. The website is easy to use and should work with any browser.
Other Opportunities for Fun:
But wait! There's more! Lots more! So far, I've been telling you about fully programmed games. However, there are opportunities for solitary and social play beyond these that still take advantage of the capabilities of your iOS device. We'll briefly touch on some of these possibilities below.
    Let's start with books. Amazon makes several gamebooks from various authors available as Kindle books. Rather than having people scroll through the book looking for the correct paragraph to turn to when making a choice, Kindle books have active links that take you instantly to the right spot when you activate them using VoiceOver. Just turn your rotor to links and flick up or down to go through and find the correct link. At that point, double tap on it. Usually, these books aren't merely just a set of such choices. There are dice and statistics involved. That's not a problem though. You could easily use apps like the Notes app to keep track of statistics and other important information. As for dice, have no fear. There are a number of simple and accessible dice rolling apps. One popular choice here is an older app called Natural 20. The author took the time to make the app fully accessible with VoiceOver. It is very powerful and easy to customize to whatever your particular gaming needs might be. This includes creating special dice or cards. This app has stood the test of time very well and remains popular among blind and sighted players.
    I doubt that I have discovered every Kindle gamebook out there. However, here are some that I've found. The Critical If series of gamebooks includes Down Among the Dead Men, Heart of Ice, Once Upon a Time in Arabia, Necklace of Skulls, and possibly others. Another popular and fully playable series of gamebooks is called Destiny Quest. These are written by Michael Ward. The series starts with The Legion of Shadows. The story continues in The Heart of Fire, The Eye of Winter's Fury, and Raiders of the Dune Sea.
    Beyond these single-player gamebooks, you can also obtain other books related to games. There are many excellent books related to game design that could help you create your own games. Also, there are core rulebooks, sourcebooks, and campaign or adventure books for various roleplaying game systems. In a roleplaying game or RPG, you and other players basically collaborate to tell a story together. Most of the players play the main characters in the story, making decisions and dealing with the consequences. Usually, one player is the game master and controls the situations and other characters encountered by the players. There are rules governing what happens so that it's an actual game and not just a shared storytelling. Dice and statistics are often used so that neither the game master nor the players are in full control of how events unfold. Many of these are available as Kindle books. However, I have gotten most such books as PDF or ePUB books directly from the publishers of the various games and RPG systems. Also, many of these books are included in bundles sold at places like www.drivethroughrpg.com and www.bundleofholding.com and a personal favourite, www.storybundle.com.
    I would use an app like Voice Dream Reader to read such titles. It makes navigating ebooks simple. However, the Books app which is already present on your iPhone can handle books written in PDF and EPUB formats quite well also. Most of these ebooks are sold without any digital rights management complicating things. I keep copies of any such books I purchase in iCloud as well as in the app I'm reading the books in. They are then always at hand, ready for use.
    A lot of the material for the latest edition of Dungeons & Dragons can be obtained in an app called D&D Beyond. The various books can be purchased from within the app and may also be read quite accessibly in the app. Tables and charts may require sighted assistance for ease of understanding. However, the rules themselves are certainly fully accessible.
    There are other publishers who have gone out of their way to make their RPG system materials accessible to blind users. These include:
    Chaosium Inc.: www.chaosium.com - This long-established company is responsible for the highly regarded Call of Cthulhu and RuneQuest game systems, among other excellent offerings. All the rules and adventures and such are offered electronically, and it's all very accessible for blind readers.
    Monte Cook Games: www.montecookgames.com - This well-established game developer is widely praised for the Cypher system that can be used to tell any kind of story. They also have the more mysterious Sci-Fi-based Numenera system that focusses heavily on exploration and discovery rather than combat. Their family-friendly No Thank You, Evil! The RPG system is suitable for all ages. All of the book and campaign materials are available as very accessible ebooks. Monte is eager to include everyone and has been making his ebook material accessible to screen readers for quite some years now. More recently, Monte Cook Games used Kickstarter to fund the launching of a line of books to aid in improving the RPG experience. These include Your Best Game Ever, Stay Alive, and other titles.
    Some people skilled in the use of spreadsheets have put their capabilities to use in the service of fun. They have created complex character sheets for efficiently keeping track of statistics. Also, I've heard of people using spreadsheets as a way to set up accessible game boards using cells as spots. You need to be willing to do all the moving of pieces and updating of conditions or cards in play manually. However, people have successfully done this while apparently having fun.
    There are many apps built specifically for aiding in the play of tabletop roleplaying games. This includes the Roll20 app and web service. Apparently, much of the app and website are accessible to blind players.
    A couple of well established groups are dedicated to making this kind of gaming as accessible to blind players as possible. One such group is called Knights Of The Braille. Check out their activities at:
    https://knightsofthebraille.com
    While the Knights of the Braille group is focussed on playing rpgs using the web, another group is striving to make the books and equipment for the hobby more accessible. The DotsRPG project has worked with game publishers and others to achieve this objective. Find out more about its activities at:
    https://www.dotsrpg.org
    Keep in mind that there are also physical accessible gaming accessories designed to be used via touch. Decks of standard Braille cards are widely available. There are also actual Braille dice to roll. The six sided variety have been available for decades now. A pair of these more standard dice are what most game books will require that their players have on hand. These don't actually use Braille numbers but feature raised bumps in arrangements which make quickly determining the results of rolls straightforward.
    More recently, Thanks to the Dots RPG Project partnering with Die Hard Dice, there are now very durable, well-made mass-produced polyhedral dice used including those use in more complex 
    A company called 64 OZ Games produces accessibility kits for many modern board and card games. Using 3D-printed pieces, Brailled sleeves, QR codes and other techniques, they provide what is needed for blind people to play on equal terms with others. Your iPhone can help you read any QR codes which typically take you to web addresses with card text, rules, or other information. You could use the Notes app or other apps to help keep score or keep track of other information which might change throughout the game. If interested, go to:

Where Blind People Stand in iOS Gaming:
Things have certainly gotten better for those of us seeking accessible fun to be had on our iPhones since I wrote the first draft of this section. In a little over five years, there have been many exciting new game titles made accessible to blind players. Many different factors have led to this. Changes in app store economic options have given developers more ways to make money for their efforts. Subscriptions and in-app purchases are far more common than they used to be.
    By far, the introduction of a plugin to make it easier for games made using the Unity development platform was the most unexpected and welcome advancement. It will have a tremendously beneficial wide-ranging impact going forward. Now that there's a standard and affordable way to add accessibility, the odds have increase substantially that developers approached to make their games accessible will say yes rather than no. This, when combined with a thankfully spreading awareness of blind iPhone users, should result in many more games becoming accessible even after they're released. This benefit will also hold true outside of games and should increase the number of accessible apps in other categories such as productivity.
    VoiceOver has gained the ability to describe images and read any text which might be present on them. This too will have implications for playful possibilities. While Apple intelligence has yet to reveal its potential in this regard, one could certainly use the visual intelligence feature to quickly obtain descriptions of physical game elements.
    Games have long been a driving force for technological improvements.
    Over the past few decades, games have become an increasingly important part of our culture. People have realized the potential of games to help us connect with and learn from each other. Games aren't just wastes of time because the act of play isn't a waste of time. Play is crucial to a healthy mind. It helps us form deeper connections in the brain and lets us learn deeply. Games can help us to better understand our world, technology, and each other. Whenever I've gotten some new and different accessible technology, one of the first things I do is look for opportunities for play. I might grudgingly spend an hour trying to figure out how to use the screen review capabilities of my screen reader. This sort of effort is necessary at times to grasp the basics. On the other hand, I'll cheerfully spend a whole weekend attempting to win an adventure or master a game I can play with other people. When Monday rolls around, and it's work time, last weekend's fun has given me skills that make the work I need to do much easier. I hope this section of the guide has pointed you to something you can thoroughly enjoy.
    It's critical that we go into this area with realistic and reasonable expectations. None of the developers making accessible games are making large sums of money for their troubles. The pressure to move onto the next game rather than add accessibility or other improvements is always there. Awareness is slowly spreading among sighted developers about blind iPhone users and their hunger for accessible games. There isn't very good advertising which developers are likely to know about necessarily. I've often been asked what magazine, radio show, website, etc to place advertisements which would let blind people know about accessible games. There are a growing list of answers, including and beyond Applevis, but it's hard to achieve the same kind of penetration that can be achieved advertising to sighted gamers where information channels are far more established an better funded. Apple has nominated several accessible games for its yearly Apple Design Award. However, these games must compete with apps that have often achieved great good. Blind Drive was nominated but lost out to Be My Eyes not so very long ago.
    The Applevis site now features a "best game" category and also allows games to be voted for which weren't in the initial list of apps. This is a good step in the right direction and may give more games a chance for an unexpected win. However, there aren't any other awards for accessible games which I'm aware of. Nothing which would recognize achievements such as best accessible sound design, best user interface, etc. There really ought to be something which dives more deeply into categories of accomplishment in accessible game creation. Efforts to spread awareness of the Applevis community among game developers would potentially do a lot of good. So would mechanisms in the app store which advertised accessible apps and games to VoiceOver users.
    Sad as it might be, not all games can be made accessible to blind people. Many games simply require sight to play. Any attempt to make them accessible would so fundamentally alter the game experience as to constitute a completely different game. Ian Hamilton, based in Australia, is a strong advocate for accessible games. He points out that all games involve some sort of challenges, and that this essentially means that standards for accessibility must differ from other industries. Games often simply can't include everybody and remain true to themselves. For instance, some games can induce seizures in epileptic people. Others demand a level of visual perception. Games reliant on audio are splendid for blind people, but exclude those who cannot hear or who have poor hearing. My own hearing loss has rendered games based heavily on echolocation somewhat less attractive to me than they once were.
    Bearing this in mind, we're in a paradoxical position as blind consumers of iOS games. On one hand, we still face the classic situation where around 95% of games are inaccessible to completely blind players. It would be foolish to presume that a game picked at random from the app store was accessible. At least one blind person thought to try Super Mario Run from Nintendo when it was released in late 2016. Quickly, an entry appeared on AppleVis which chronicled the disappointment possible when expectations exceed the reality of where we stand. Thankfully, the game was free to try. It takes a special effort and careful, well-considered use of sound to make arcade-style games accessible. There's a big difference between using sound as ear candy and a minor source of information and using sound as the only source of critical information. Don't expect even large companies like Nintendo to put in that level of extra effort without substantial legal or financial incentives. I believe it would be quite possible to make a similar audio arcade game fully accessible to blind people. However, it would take expertly considered audio design and extensive testing by blind gamers. It's more than simply adding sounds and spoken textual information. The small number of blind people who would be at all interested in a given specific title makes it hard to justify the costs involved.
    The odds are far better with smaller app developers. Especially if accessibility is brought to their attention early while they're working on their app. It is much easier and less costly to plan accessibility from day one than to add it in later. The same goes for instilling the kind of thinking that leads to a real desire to put in the effort to make games as inclusive as possible.
    The iOS platform greatly lowers the resources and effort required to make many kinds of games accessible. At the same time, the economic environment set up by Apple is a favourable one for smaller developers or even single individuals skilled in programming. There has never been a situation where the economics and potential for being included in less complex, time-sensitive games has been better. The audio capabilities of an iPhone would certainly be sufficient for spectacularly fun purely audio games. However, don't imagine that making even a text-based game accessible to VoiceOver is always as simple as flipping a switch.
    There are, sadly, many instances where games that could quite feasibly be made accessible simply aren't. This is due to a lack of awareness on the part of app developers as well as higher up the chain. Platforms like Unity that are used to develop apps don't always make it easy for developers to add accessibility using Apple's built-in tools like VoiceOver. The accessibility plugin developed for Unity has resulted in a small wave of unusually deep and complex games being made accessible after being released. I am personally very hopeful that some examples sighted in this section will prove inspiration to more developers to get on board the accessibility bandwagon.
    We aren't being excluded out of malice. I hope people keep this in mind when contacting developers whose games are inaccessible to blind players. Rather, it is due to a lack of awareness and lack of economic incentive. Blind people make up a small percent of users of iOS devices, despite how widely they have been adopted by the blind community. This results in developers having to make choices favouring ease of construction over others that might allow for better accessibility but be more costly and difficult to work with. Therefore, you run into games that sound from their descriptions like they should be fully playable. They may be described as text-based games not even requiring typing, and yet be utterly useless to blind people. Efforts are underway to change this sort of problem, but change is slow in coming. Economics are a big part of that.
    More developers seem to be getting the message. Especially smaller independent developers. There are now a number of new accessible games which I have felt compelled to add to this guide. Thanks, largely to changes in the app store, I haven't needed to remove any titles from the section. Given the relatively small number of accessible games compared to inaccessible ones, this is a very positive thing. Due to Apple's commitment to accessibility, we've never been in a better position. A lot of potential for different game experiences begs for exploration. Board games that provide audio and tactile feedback are possible. Audio experiences taking advantage of sensors built into iOS devices have been created already. There are many areas of games I believe could be made accessibly on iOS devices that simply haven't been yet. For instance, it should be very possible to make a Mario style platformer game. More complex modern board and card games should also be feasible. It's a matter of skill, resources, economics, and time. Economics are such that independent game developers can create more inclusive games and experiment with new ideas. Awareness of what's happening and polite, timely communication are the keys to greater inclusion. This is an area where being an active, informed consumer can really pay off. If you hear about a game you're interested in, find out as much as you can about it. Have an idea how an inaccessible game might be made accessible when you approach its developer. They often don't know where to begin with accessibility. People are still discovering the possibilities of iOS, and there's a willingness to experiment. It's important that we be aware of what we're asking for, and that economics can be very tight for smaller developers. They may not have the money to spend on the time and effort needed to make games accessible.
    I've long felt that organizations of and for blind people could be a lot more supportive in this space than they have been. Games are not just frivolous wastes of time and money. They're tools that can teach, unify, and reach people far beyond the classroom. They're also the dominant art form, pulling in more revenue than movies and music combined. Innovations like 3D Touch combined with vibration and oral feedback could help make it possible to play board, card, and strategy games. Back in the 1980s, a series of adventure gamebooks called Fighting Fantasy won awards for encouraging children to read. Teens who didn't enjoy reading were drawn into the worlds of these books that were as much games as story. Blind people completely missed out on this and many other phenomena, since it would have been very costly to transcribe these books into Braille. The books would have spanned multiple thick volumes, even if they didn't include tactile pictures. Finding the correct next paragraph to read would have been somewhat more cumbersome than it was for sighted readers who had all the text in a single paperback volume. Technology has now reached the point where much of the cost and bulk could be removed entirely. Text-based games combined with iOS devices and affordable Braille displays like the Orbit Reader 20 could make a tremendous difference for Braille literacy, particularly among blind youth. Paragraphs can be linked. Portability is no longer a factor when thousands of full-length books can be carried easily on even a cheap smartphone. For me, Braille was simply never exciting or fun. In hindsight, the advantages of learning and reading Braille seem obvious. However, unless the story was interesting to me, the motivation to practice just wasn't there. In Braille, I read what I was forced to. On the computer and through tapes and CDs in those days, I listened to what I actually wanted to in far more portable forms. Organizations like CNIB, RNIB, AFB and others could support game development economically. They could provide advertising space in their publications, so blind people know what's out there. They could also put time and resources into making game developers aware of the potential of the blind audience and of the tools and techniques required to make games accessible when possible.
    Before obtaining a game from the app store, do a bit of research to avoid disappointment. Check on the AppleVis site to make certain games that interest you are, in fact, accessible and suitable for your level of skill. Go to www.AppleVis.com. The app directories are full of descriptions and reviews of games that have turned out to be either inaccessible or accessible. The deck is stacked in favour of accessible games. People tend to want to share positive experiences, leading others to them. However, there are thankfully some people brave enough to try apps and report back to the community when they face the disappointment of discovering that an app is inaccessible. Don't presume that just because a game has an entry on AppleVis that it is accessible. Take the time to actually read the entry. Do the homework, and you won't spend money on apps you can't use.

Physical and Mental Health:
Having a portable, powerful computer like an iPHONE which is carried everywhere by its owner presents some wonderful opportunities when it comes to tracking and caring for mental and physical health. Furthermore, there are opportunities for research based on informed consent. All manner of people, from health professionals to concerned individuals have come forward with a flurry of apps to take advantage of this data gold mine and of ways to help all of us live better, healthier lives.
    One innovative example is an app called ZRX. It combines a workout training app with audio drama and game elements in an attempt to motivate people to exercise. Using motion sensors in your iPhone or Apple Watch, this app tracks your runs on a treadmill, on the spot, or through the real world via GPS tracking.
    Still very popular in 2024, the app originally known as Zombies Run has rebranded and is called ZRX. While the original content and story of defending Able Township from a zombie filled land is still present and substantially expanded, many additional audio adventures have been added. These include adventures based on heroes in the Marvel universe.
    In this section, we will explore the many ways your iOS device can help you understand where you are in terms of mental and physical health. We'll also look at apps and other resources designed to help you take the steps necessary to improve and protect it. This is a relatively new territory for me. I live a largely sedentary life and have only sporadically taken much interest in fitness and overall physical health. My interest in mental health is more robust. Even so, the apps dealing with mental wellness are ones which I only began to seriously explore due to the isolation the Covid-19 pandemic forced upon all of us. I hope that the discoveries of accessible apps and options which I discuss below will be of some help.
    In a nutshell, the HealthKit is Apple's attempt to serve customers interested in improving their health. It is a repository for all kinds of data that comes mainly from third-party apps and wearable devices like Apple Watch or other third-party fitness trackers. There are also many apps that let you track the calories you burn while exercising. There are apps that take your health data into account and help you keep track of the water you drink during the day. Examples include the ZRX app I mentioned earlier. Those who love snark will perhaps find the CARROT Fit app to be a pleasantly sadistic workout coach. These apps can track data and interface with the Health app on your iOS device. Diet apps such as MyFitnessPal can help you keep track of and determine how many calories you're consuming. Other apps help you keep hydrated, taking account of the water you drink.
    All of this adds to the data stored in the Health app. This is your main interface with the HealthKit component of iOS. This data can, in turn, be used to motivate and advise you in matters of exercise and health. It is also used to store medical data. Apps developed by health researchers allow that data to be collected anonymously and used for large-scale studies. This is proving tremendously helpful to health science as it tries to tackle everything from heart health to cancer.
    If you have an iPhone or iPad, it will have an accelerometer allowing it to sense motion. This allows for counting steps taken as you walk or run. However, to really get the most out of HealthKit's abilities requires an Apple Watch or other somewhat cheaper fitness tracker accessory. There are some kinds of exercise equipment that can interface with your iOS device, allowing you to control them in an accessible manner. Data generated by these machines is integrated into HealthKit.
    When it comes to health and personal medical data, things can get complicated. Just because something is possible, that doesn't always mean that you'll be able to take advantage of it. Medical regulations in various countries can result in features being blocked and unavailable unless they are approved. A recent example of this is the hearing aid capability added to second generation AirPods Pro earbuds. Apple gave them the ability to function like over the counter hearing aids. This was approved rapidly in the US. However, Canada lacks a category for devices which aren't prescription hearing aids. Apple is likely to find a way to gain approval for this in Canada, but as of this writing, this hasn't happened yet. I totally understand that the goal of this legal blockage is to try and make certain that people who think they need help with hearing loss actually see an audiologist and don't skip that opportunity to get professional help. Properly adjusted proscription hearing aids would absolutely be a better solution in most cases. Despite this, Ifind the continued blocking of this feature from being activated for people in Canada deeply frustrating for me. It would have been very helpful to have them as a backup for when my actual hearing aids break down. They're rather expensive for anybody who wasn't quite wealthy to keep an extra set handy for such occasions. I would have been very thankful for this feature during the pandemic when I had to go months with one working hearing aid.
    Another example is the ability for the Apple Watch to perform ECG tests, which appeared in series 5 watches. Initially, this ability to perform an ECG was present in the watch hardware and software, but blocked for users in Canada. It only later became useable once medical approval had been obtained. Similarly, the ability to participate in medical research programs that collect data via HealthKit will also be specific to various countries. Before investing in health related hardware, it is wise to check that the features you are interested in will be available in your country.
The Health App:
This is your interface to all the information stored and collected in HealthKit. You are also able to input data into the Health app. At the top left of the screen, you'll find a Profile button. This lets you input medical information and also lets you access settings to control which apps have access to this data. You can also inform HealthKit that you use a wheelchair, which changes how motion is counted during workouts.
    The Health app is the main place where you can interact with all data related to your health. It has three tabs on the bottom. The first tab is called Summary. It is meant to be a kind of dashboard where you can keep track of the health data that is most important to you. At the top of the tab, you'll find an Edit button. Double tapping this will take you to an area where you can turn on or off different aspects of health data, thereby adding or removing them from the contents of the summary. You can read any data in the summary and double tap on any Show All buttons to expand what is there.
    At the bottom of the Summary tab, you'll find a heading called Get More From Health. Underneath this heading, you'll find articles and apps related to health that may be of interest. I read one having to do with hearing loss, as I actually have moderate hearing loss and use hearing aids. Keep in mind that the recommended apps and articles may be older and out of date.
    The "Sharing" tab is where any matters concerning the sharing of your health data are managed. Apps will record or check data in order to help you directly or to aid in research you've agreed to participate in. For instance, many apps such as Headspace can check or add to your mindful minutes statistic. Mindful minutes are those spent meditating or engaged in other activities which encourage mindfulness and good mental health. The meditations or activities I do in Headspace take time which is recorded in my health data as mindful minutes. Apps will need to have your permission to read or record mindful minutes as you use them.
    In addition to apps needing your permission to adjust information stored in Healthkit, they will also need your permission to share that data. You will be able to control which apps or individuals you share your health data with. You might, for example, share your workout data with a family member or close friend. Perhaps, you might share your heart rate with someone who was monitoring you during an experiment or while you attempted an arduous task.
    The Browse tab contains all the health data organized into health categories. There's a search field at the top, so you can find what you need without having to drill down. Otherwise, each category of information has a button. Double tap it to go into that category. Any information will be available. Furthermore, you'll find a button to add data. Most often, data will be added via apps or equipment like an Apple Watch. However, you'll find options inside categories letting you log data directly, find out more about the area of interest, pin or unpin the category from the summary tab, and other options like scheduling reminders to take action.
    When you first run the Health app, you will be asked to enter information to complete a health profile. You will also be given an opportunity to create a medical ID that can contain information important for first responders or other health professionals who might need to treat you. This information is made available to first responders in a manner accessible from the Emergency SOS Dialer without needing to know your passcode. If you choose not to set this up right away, you can always do so from the Settings app in the Health section. There, you will also find settings that let you manage which apps and devices can access your health data.
    Apple takes your privacy very seriously, and you can always change your mind about letting an app or exercise equipment access your health data. Should you wish to share the information with medical professionals like your doctor, it is possible to export the information.
Bedtime:
In the summary, you can have a section called "Sleep". This lets you schedule a reminder to go to bed plus a wakeup time. You can select from a number of attractive wakeup sounds as a gentler approach to wakefulness than the alarm clock. Moreover, you can set things, so you're not woken up on weekends. It's pretty flexible. It analyzes your usage of your device to help determine when you're actually sleeping or when you might perhaps have gotten up early. Data is recorded and placed in the Health app, where it may be used with other information or third-party apps. There are numerous apps designed to track and analyze your sleep to improve your health.
    While in sleep mode, you can decide whether to have your Apple Watch or iPHONE show the time and date. Other than that, the sleep mode will automatically do things like turn on "do not disturb" so you won't be roused by notifications or calls. The iPHONE or iPAD alone can only track basic stuff, like when you're clearly awake and using it. For more detailed sleep tracking, the sensors on the Apple Watch or other compatible sleep tracking aids can yield more detailed results. For instance, I can receive information on how long I've spent in different states of sleep.
Thoughts on the Apple Watch:
My wife Sara and I have each invested in an Apple Watch. Having taken the plunge far earlier than your somewhat sedentary author, she has gotten plenty of use out of hers over the years that it has lasted.
    Wearable devices like an Apple Watch contain more capabilities, such as the ability to measure your heart rate via optical or electrical sensors against your wrist. These additional sensors can let the Health app know about more precise information. More capabilities are constantly emerging. A recent addition lets your watch measure the audio levels in your environment and warn you if there's a dangerous level of noise. More advanced Apple Watches can also measure your blood oxygen level. This can be useful for fitness tracking and also for sleep tracking. You can receive notifications if sensors detect problems like low blood oxygen level or irregular heart rhythm.
    Your watch can also display information such as upcoming events, news, etc. Many iPhone apps can partner with apps on your watch, which can come in handy. Perhaps, you want to know the weather but don't want to lose your place in an app you're using. The watch can make that sort of thing possible.
State of Mind and Mood Tracking:
The Health app now also contains a mental wellbeing category. You can choose whether it is displayed in the "Summary" tab. In that area of the Health app, you will find options letting you take mental health questionnaires. These will measure your risk for anxiety and depression. You will also find a mood logging facility letting you indicate your current mood. It will also let you record the causes of the mood you're in. For example, friends, family, work, etc. Over time, this can help you figure out what to focus on in order to feel better. You can have your iPhone remind you to do these mood logs during the day if this would be helpful.
    In the mental wellbeing section of the Health app, you will also find an option to take a general anxiety and depression questionnaire. The results of this will help you understand your risk of encountering these difficulties. This doesn't replace what professionals in the area of mental health can do. Rather, it may help to alert you if you are possibly in need of such professional help. You may also be able to take other steps to improve your mental health short of such professional help.
    These tools plus the mindful minutes statistic form the core of the resources Apple makes available to stay apprized of your mental state. For ways to better take care of your mental health, their apps should be investigated. This includes the Fitness app, which has a suite of mental health resources.
The Fitness App:
Apple has introduced a Fitness app and Fitness Plus service to its offerings. Professional coaches and famous people give workouts for the body and meditations for the mind. New workouts and material is added constantly. For blind people, the workouts are largely difficult to use. This was a big disappointment to many blind people. Apple hasn't provided any written descriptions of moves for workouts, which can be heard or read ahead of doing them. However, they're interested in improving the usefulness of the Fitness Plus service to blind users. Very recently, in early 2022, Apple took the first big step forward. There are now some audio hints offered for VoiceOver users which attempt to describe what trainers don't. These are short bits of explanation read in between or during what trainers are saying. Hints are read out loud by VoiceOver. The only way to get an idea of how moves go would be to listen to a workout with the audio hints before actually doing it. There's no way to look over complete descriptions of posture and movements outside of a workout at a slow step by step pace. Coaches go at a fast pace which presumes that people can see the movements and don't need them described extensively.
    Now that workouts can be shared via the SharePlay feature, it would be possible for a sighted person to go through the various moves along with a blind person. The sighted person could give the description required for the blind person to know he or she understands a given move and is doing it right. Apple seems willing to add accessibility. I'm hopeful that the audio hints are a step on the journey. If this was the big idea that Apple hoped would placate the blind community, letting them count Fitness Plus as accessible, it falls short.
    There are some parts of the app which lend themselves to easier use by blind enthusiasts. Guided meditations and podcasts meant to be enjoyed during a walk are two elements which are easy for blind people to make use of. The walking podcasts are done by famous people who offer interesting talks while one goes for a walk. Meditations typically give good instructions and are easy to follow.
    The app has a pretty simple layout with three tabs. The "Summary" tab gives you a basic look at how you're doing in terms of activity. It can be edited to include more information and categories of particular importance to you. Think of it as your dashboard. It will always contain a button which will let you examine your activity rings. If you have an iPhone, it can track your steps presuming you're carrying it when you make them. If you're wearing an Apple Watch, more information will be tracked including movement, breathing, standing. You'll also find buttons letting you examine any workout trends, awards you've earned or might work towards, and trainer tips.
    The central tab is "Fitness Plus" which is where you can access all the workouts and offerings of the services presuming you've subscribed to it.
    Finally, the "Sharing" tab at the right lets you participate with friends and others in shared activities. These may be competitions happening when people have time individually. Alternatively, they may be at agreed upon times when people can participate in a workout together. This may prove a useful way of having workouts described by a patient family member or friend with time to pause, go back, and explain movements. The blind person might take notes or record this as it happens so that he or she can practice the movements at their own leisure and then be able to participate in the workouts at full speed.
    Apple seems open to doing more to make this service more accessible to the blind if they can figure out a way to do this which fits their style of inclusivity. Hopefully, this will eventually result in a service blind people can really enjoy fully and independently with minimal effort apart from that demanded by workouts. Meanwhile, I would suggest making use of other apps and resources described below:
Some Accessible Tools for Physical Health:
There are thousands of apps that take advantage of your iOS device's data storage and computational capabilities to attempt to help you keep fit and healthy. Unfortunately, most of these are not designed with the accessibility needs of blind and other disabled users in mind. This is one area where you should do as much as possible to check if an app is accessible with VoiceOver before you make a purchase or subscribe. Look on the Applevis site or your preferred blindness related sites to find out if anyone has successfully used the app you're interested in. With third-party apps, even when they're made by the same people, you take a chance that you'll end up with something completely inaccessible for VoiceOver users. This is even the case with the other apps made by developers of the superbly accessible ZRX! On the other hand, CARROT Fit and CARROT Hunger are both perfectly accessible.
The Carrot Apps:
There are several apps made under the Carrot monicker. Carrot Fit and Carrot Hunger are the two most useful for health and wellness. Carrot Fit gives you short workouts comprised of different moves. It does so in a fun way, playing the role of an evil artificial intelligence full of nerdy references and snark. Instructions are spoken out as the workout progresses. The app integrates with Healthkit and you can keep track of calories burned. You are also rewarded in various ways for doing your workouts each day.
    Carrot Hunger is a calorie tracker. Whenever you eat something, you are encouraged to add it to your daily intake in the app. With snark, encouragement and some discipline on your part, this app can be a helpful addition to your toolbox.
ReVision Fitness Production:
This app is designed to be accessible for blind and sighted people interested in getting fit. Workouts are designed to be easy to follow for blind people. Pre-workout cessions containing descriptions of all movements made during the actual workout are provided so that it's easier to familiarize yourself as a blind person with new exercises. There's also a "classroom" tab where you can go through materials about various exercises.
    This app has five tabs across the bottom. The Dashboard, at the far left, is where you can read news about new additions to the app. You can also comment or like particular items of interest. This is still a relatively new app and I expect more will be added here.
    The next tab to the right is called Classroom. It is where you can find several lessons about foundational movements, postures, and exercises. The lessons found here will help you master the various workout exercises more quickly and safely. New lessons are added frequently. You can either read the lessons in text or hear them read out loud by a human instructor.
    Next over is the "Fitness Studio" tab. It's in the centre of the bottom of the screen. This is where you'll come to find all the workouts on offer. You can search, favourite and activate the various workouts. You'll be coached through them by a human trainer. Controls are present to play, pause and go back or forward within a workout.
    The "Fitness Plan" tab is next. It contains various plans to help you do things like lose weight, gain muscle, etc. The plans are designed to be done over a period of days or weeks. Currently, no notifications or reminders are given. It's totally up to the user to follow these plans and do the workouts as the plan suggests.
    The More tab on the far right has options to sign in or out, manage your subscription, read the legal waver you agree to by using the app, and learn about the app. You'll also find contact options to get in touch and offer feedback. The app requites you to subscribe one a fourteen-day trial is complete. As of April 2022, the costs are around $5. US for a monthly subscription or $59 for a yearly plan.
    This app will be very useful to people who want full descriptions of exercise moves. The developer has put hours into making the app as easy to use for VoiceOver users as possible, and to giving good descriptions for the various moves. Hopefully, enough people will subscribe to make this approach economically sustainable. People should be aware that this app doesn't integrate with the Apple healthkit in any way. It just offers workouts and instructions in an accessible form. People can get wearable fitness trackers, such as an Apple Watch, to fill in this gap nicely. The Apple Watch is very accessible and can track things like motion, heart rate, etc.
Eyes Free Fitness:
Beyond apps, you can find plenty of workout videos on the web. One especially useful collection of audio workouts can be found in a channel called Eyes-free Fitness. These are available as YouTube videos that you can play on YouTube. You may also still be able to find some or all of the workouts as MP3 files which you could load into an app such as Voice Dream Reader and play the workout following the instructions. There are methods to convert the sound of YouTube videos into MP3 files. This goes beyond the scope of the guide, so you'll need to track down a suitable method to do this yourself. Even the first level cardio workout can tucker me out. I dread trying the Bootcamp workout. Full audio and text descriptions of the exercises were also included. Unfortunately, the business that produced these workouts was ultimately unsustainable. The workouts were, therefore, made free for anybody to download. At the time of this edition's publication in 2022, the website which hosted these materials has sadly expired. The YouTube channel above is the only remaining source for the workouts which I'm aware of.
Aaptiv:
This is an app and service which produces audio workouts you can use on your iOS device. You can pay for a subscription, giving you access to all the workouts. For Audible members, some material from Aaptiv has also been made available on that service. This would be a good way to see if their style of encouragement would be suitable for you.
Mental Health Apps:
At present, the Healthkit in iOS can keep statistics of your state of mind, mood, mindful minutes, and sleep quality. Your time spent sleeping is tracked as much as possible. This is either done based on your bedtime schedule and whether you're using your iOS device or not. Alternatively, there are accessories like an Apple Watch, which provides Healthkit more information to go on when determining the timing and quality of your sleep. The latest high-end Apple Watch has sensors to monitor your heart rate and blood oxygen level. These will change as you sleep.
    The other measurement is called "mindful minutes". Many apps have been developed which help people take the time to care for their own mental health. Such apps track how long people spend engaged in the meditation and other practices they offer, and use this facility in Healthkit as a common metric.
    Beyond this, there are a wide and fast-growing range of apps which take advantage of the artificial intelligence, connectedness, and portability of your iOs device to help you take care of your own mental health. Some apps help you meditate and offer other mental coaching to instil positive, calm thinking. Others offer soundscapes, videos, and other facilities to help in various ways. There are a growing number of journaling apps designed to help you derive maximum benefit from writing down your thoughts about aspects of your life. Many of these apps are paired with communities of people who use them which form on social media platforms and are typically managed by company staff to keep them as safe for their customers as possible.
    Aside from all this, there are all kinds of other resources which apps on your iPHONE can allow you to make use of. One recent example is an increasing number of mental health offerings on Netflix. Subscribers to that service can watch the Headspace Guide to Meditation and the Headspace Guide to Sleep. There are also many other documentaries about the brain and mental health. Most streaming services, including Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video, will have documentaries and other shows geared towards mental health. YouTube is an endless fountain of videos on this. Audible has a massive, an ever-increasing selection of free offerings about mental and physical health and wellbeing. And then, there are all the books on mental health to be found in Kindle, Apple Books, digital libraries like CELA, etc. Many podcasts deal with mental health as well.
    When it comes to mental health, it's very much up to you to take it seriously and put effort into using the advice, resources, or techniques available. It is perfectly possible to be in a heated argument while your iPHONE app thinks you're meditating and credits you with mindful minutes. Some apps may use sensors in the iPhone or in accessories like an Apple Watch to try to tell empirically to some degree whether you're focused. However, when it comes to mental health, it's really all on the honour system far more than physically measurable workouts and such. You'll get better results if you're self-motivated and accountable enough to follow advice provided by apps or other mental health media.
Overall mental Wellness Apps:
Combining expertly crafted meditation and mental wellness tools with the portable convenience of an iPHONE or iPAD has proved to be a very popular and successful line of thought. Much as a gymnasium offers exercise equipment for the body, the basic idea is to offer something similar for the mind. Resources and coaching to help people develop good mental habits which lead to increased resilience and overall happiness are offered through these apps to millions of users. Meditation is a big part of this, but there's more to it. There's also guided self reflection, habits of positive thinking, compassion for yourself and others, mental awareness, and relaxation. Typically, there are communities or forums for constructive discussion, which the people behind these apps will host. The apps also help with tracking your mental health through journaling and keeping statistics. Apple's health kit takes and shares data with these apps to help build a better picture of your overall health. You can then look over your mental wellness and get a sense of how you're doing over time. You pay for ongoing access to the courses, coaching services and other resources these apps provide, just like you'd pay a membership fee for a gym.
    For the vast majority of people, one of these overall mental wellness apps I discuss here in this subsection should be sufficient to meet your needs. All of them allow you to try out what they offer before committing to pay for a subscription. Back in January 2021, I paid for an annual subscription to two very differently focussed, notable apps in this category. Namely, Headspace and Shine. I continued to use and explore both apps and note any updates and new offerings they introduced over that time. Headspace is one of the more traditional, well established heavyweights in this space. They're based in the US and UK. They were founded by an English meditation enthusiast who became an ordained Buddhist monk who met a stressed advertising executive. Furthermore, they want to bring the benefits of mindfulness and meditation to as many people as possible. They're very aware of their blind audience and have put sustained effort into making their app accessible. Meanwhile, the now unavailable Shine app gained attention from Apple, being placed in the best apps of 2020. They were founded by American women of Black and Asian heritage who feel that the mental wellness industry is pricy, privileged and essentially ignores their past traumas and experiences. They met as co-workers and formed the Shine community to support everyone who felt similarly passed over by the more established mental wellness community. Its staff is 80% BIPOC. I was curious to see if they actually brought a substantially different vibe or tools and ideas to the offerings. Paying for annual subscriptions has given me unhurried access to each app's full kit of resources. I've taken time to dip into each of their libraries of music, videos, meditations on different topics, etc. Moreover, I've tried to get into the daily habits and routines which each app encourages its users to do. This deep exploration of Headspace and Shine is further supplemented by less costly and thorough trials of some other notable apps in this category, such as Calm and Ten Percent Happier.
    The company behind the Headspace app acquired the staf and assets of Shine some time after my subscription to that app expired. People can find the Shine collection in the headspace app and continue to benefit from the expertise and unique viewpoints of its diverse mental wellness coaches.
    I've learned a little about meditation over the years in school and various Summer camps. However, I never approached it in an earnest, sustained way like these apps help you to do. I've largely found other different helpful habits to support my mainly positive attitude. Things like taking time to sit and listen to music, using soundscape apps like Nature Space, and lots of reading. Meditation just never got explored seriously before. Even as the pandemic took hold in 2020, I felt like I was already ahead of the game. I had plenty of audio entertainment, thousands of books, good Internet connectivity, and extensive familiarity with what was available online to help my wife and I stay safe, positive and well supplied. Being used to spending a lot of time in my apartment, especially during Winter months, I felt as well-equipped as anybody. What I slowly discovered as lockdown measures and viral danger continued was that choice really makes all the difference. Missed visits with family and friends, cancelled excursions and activities, began to make me feel more confined and empty. Each trip out for appointments and essentials seemed like a slightly dangerous proposition and not to be undertaken lightly. Even as my family and friends continued to be safe and well, there was that constant low-grade fear that chance or carelessness would catch up eventually and someone I knew would be in danger. Not seeing friends and family over the 2020 holiday season pushed me to what is commonly said to be a mental pandemic wall. I felt inexplicably irritable, down and lacking in motivation. There was clearly a need for more tools in my kit. I decided to give these mental wellness apps a serious go.
    Both of the apps I chose have some free content available. To unlock the rest of their resources beyond this content, they ask people to pay a monthly or annual subscription. Typically, this unlocks premium features, coaching and other benefits. This money keeps them profitable, letting them continue to improve the app. It also makes them able to keep producing new content for their users. This is a very competitive space, so these improvements and extras are important. For anywhere near the same amount of in-person life coaching, you would pay much more than a year's subscription. These apps can't replace such professional coaching. However, for people who have the desire and discipline to help themselves, they offer tools and techniques which can make a big difference.
    Commitment and self-discipline are vital. I can't stress that enough. You'll be paying somewhere in the neighbourhood of $60 to well over $100 Canadian per year in some cases depending on the app you choose to subscribe to. If you're putting that much money into a service, please take it seriously and put in the time to make use of it. That money gives you access to a lot of well produced content. So much content, in fact, that I don't see any reason why you'd want to subscribe to more than one of these apps at a time. It may be worthwhile to subscribe for a month to a mental wellness app which interests you so that you have a good amount of time to get a proper sense of it and whether it suits you. A month's subscription will typically cost around $20 Canadian, give or take. Once you find an app which is most suitable to you, subscribe to that one annually to get the best possible bang for your buck.
    While competing in the same pond and offering similar kinds of help, these apps try to stand out from each other in many ways. They may focus on helping different groups of people. Furthermore, they usually put a lot of focus on a set of key ideas. These ideas may only differ a little. However, where emphasis is placed can make the mental journey seem very different. For instance, Shine really focussed strongly on people who feel disadvantaged or discounted. There's a lot of self affirmation and what I think of a self-esteem building stuff. Moreover, there is a major focus on self reflection and journaling habits. They provide edit boxes for such writing, typically after you have listened to a meditation. There are other opportunities in the app for such journaling. This helps people to stop and really take the time to think about how they feel and what might be happening in their lives. On the other hand, Headspace is more about helping you reach a state of awareness and calm through various meditation techniques. The approach feels more laid back, with almost no emphasis on writing down one's thoughts. The same core services and resources are offered by both apps. However, because of where focus is placed, the journeys feel very different. There are guided meditations about a whole range of issues and desires. Everything from getting better sleep to being more creative to conquering jealousy. If you have a mental issue you want a little guidance with, chances are that you'd find something applicable in any of these mental wellness apps. How much content you find which suits your particular needs will likely differ quite a bit between apps. It's important to really check at least a few of them out and get a feel for their overall style. I think that's going to be your best way to maximize what will be available to you when you really need it.
    Unique personalities are another key difference between these apps. If you've ever watched the movie called You've Got Mail, you'll remember that each of the competing book stores had their own staff of people keeping things running how the owner of the business wanted it. In similar fashion, each app has its special crew of regularly featured experts and coaches, bringing you the daily cessions and fresh advice. Headspace has Andy Puddicombe. His calm, friendly teaching style and tremendous knowledge gained through years of travel and study adds to the overall atmosphere of Headspace. The same held true for the largely female teaching coaches behind Shine.
    There is also the special content produced by famous people they manage to bring onboard. Headspace recently announced that Kevin Hart, the comedian, was doing a meditation series on Headspace. Another accessible mental wellness app called Calm has a bedtime story read by Matthew McConaughey. People who subscribe to the app will get access to this celebrity produced content and hear many well-liked and famous voices helping them on their mental journey. Special content may go beyond meditation cessions and stories. Apps often contain videos featuring experts in all manner of subjects deemed helpful to mental wellness. I've heard scientists talk about particle accelerators, astronomers, plant experts, and animal documentaries extolling the techniques and habits of various creatures.
    In 2022, the Shine app and community were acquired by Headspace Health. People who are interested in the sense of diversity and self advocacy which the Shine brand was known for should check out the Shine collection in Headspace and keep an ear out for familiar names and voices on the Headspace app.
Headspace:

    Available free with limited access from the app store. Subscription unlocks all features.
    Monthly subscription: $17.99
    Yearly subscription: $89
    This-app advertises itself as a mindfulness and meditation solution for any mood, any mind and any goal. It has gone out of its way to support VoiceOver users and make its website accessible. Headspace is at the top level of apps in this category. The only other app with as wide an awareness that I've ever come across is one called Calm. At this level, there's enough money and resources to extend way beyond the app itself. Celebrities are paid to record some meditations. There are YouTube ads and a Headspace YouTube channel. For subscribers to Netflix, there's the Headspace Guide to Meditation and another guide about sleep, which they can avail themselves of. There are a number of podcasts which are free to follow. These include Headspace Radio, Dear Headspace, and The Long-Time Academy among others. This is good advertising for the more extensive coaching and mental health resources made available in the Headspace app. However, don't think that this in any way diminishes the quality of what is offered in the guides and podcasts. Both offer a lot of useful information and are good introductions to the idea of meditation and good mental habits. They are both provided with audio description, available for blind users. They also have a very extensive and well-built website with accessibility features.
    I had been attracted to Headspace by hearing a Ted Talk and advertisements on YouTube presented by one of the app's founders. Andy Puddicombe. I very much liked his calm friendly voice, insights and speaking style. That liking increased when I read about his background and experience. He has gone to great lengths and travelled widely to learn about meditation and mindfulness. He has even become an ordained Buddhist monk. It sounded to me like this man had well and truly earned his following and expertise. Having previously heard that other blind people had found the app to be accessible, I figured I'd be in pretty good hands.
    Rapidly, it became obvious that care had been taken to support VoiceOver right from when I first opened the app. Controls, buttons, tabs and such were all properly labelled. Also, if you have VoiceOver hints enabled, you'll hear brief guiding phrases which explain what given buttons and controls do. For instance, if you pause over the "settings" button in the player, you are told that this lets you customize the length of the cession you're listening to where this makes sense. If you hear a sleepcast story, you can move a slider, which alters the balance between the vocal and ambience. There are many touches like that all through the app. Also, the app makes use of standard headings and buttons, which make it easy to get at what you want.
    Headspace uses basic interface elements very well. There are five tabs. From left to right, these are "today", "meditation", "Sleep", "Move", and "Focus". The contents in each of the tabs is pretty extensive. The "Today" tab is where you start upon opening the app. Right near the top of that tab, you can use a slider to switch what the top section shows. You can choose between showing material you've recently engaged with, or else show recommended material given what you've done with the app so far. Below this section, you'll find three other sections which don't change. They are beneath headings which you can use the rotor to navigate through. Once you flick to a heading, flick right to go through whatever contents are beneath it. You'll find a Featured Collection heading which will present different collections which change over time. Below this, you'll find a heading called Mindful Moment. Flick to the right to find a mindful moment of the day. Double tap on it to enter. Below this, you'll find a heading called Community Story. This displays a testimonial from someone who was helped by the Headspace app and wanted to share. Double tap on the title of the story to go into it. You'll also find an option below the story where you can share your story. The last things at the bottom of all tabs are two buttons. Double tap the Profile button to get into an area where you can manage settings and account information. There's also a button called Explore. Double tap this, and you can search the complete resources of Headspace for what you might want.
    Each of the other tabs takes you into a place where you can explore resources relevant to the tab's name. All of them work essentially the same way. At the top, you'll find one recommended resource. Past that, you'll find a top section, which you can choose whether it displays your most recently used resources or some recommended resources. Below that, you'll find sections divided by handy headings which have resources relevant to the tab names. For instance, in the "Sleep" tab, you'll find a heading called "explore sleep". Flick right past that heading, and you find a series of buttons. These take you to collections of that kind of resource. For example, the button called sleep casts takes you to a collection of stories with a soothing ambience which change slightly each time they're heard. I think the ambience changes rather than the stories. There are other resources such as meditations to prepare you for sleep. Another button is called "sleep SOS" and it gets you to a collection of tools to help if you wake up from sleep and need more. The other tabs are similarly stuffed with resources. Everything from short meditations to mindful workouts and videos. There are hundreds of items available.
    There aren't many trouble spots in terms of accessibility. One thing I've noticed is that the back button to get out of a particular meditation or cession you're playing is beside the Play button, rather than at the top left. There's always a Back button somewhere on the screen but for some reason, they don't stick to the convention of having it at the top left of screens. That might throw off beginners a bit. Also, there's no way to independently adjust the volume of the available soundscapes. They're of excellent quality but tend to overpower VoiceOver volume, so it's difficult to hear what you're doing while listening to them. If you just want to bask in a soundscape, they're great for that. Using audio ducking solves this problem nicely once you've found a good ducking amount. Furthermore, the help and support is buried in the "profile" "settings" area of the app. It could have been more prominently placed. People searching for help would do better to go to the Headspace website:

Journaling:
Therapists and psychologists have long advocated for people to take up writing journals to help with mental health. One very popular type of journal is a gratitude journal. People take the time each day to stop and think about what they're grateful for and write those things down. This can be used later as a reminder of the good things in your life. This in itself can be of great help. There is also a more immediate and important effect. The very act of thinking about and writing these thoughts down brings what you're grateful for more firmly into your mind. This can help tremendously if you're facing a challenging day. It can help you keep a more positive perspective on life.
    Writing down your thoughts can also help you to stop and question any negative ones. It gives a moment's pause, granting the time and space to examine them before letting them pile up or perhaps acting on them in the heat of the moment.
    You will find extensive coverage of Apple's Journal app introduced in iOs 17 in a dedicated section earlier in this guide. However, I thought it was important to leave some brief remarks about the mental health benefits of journaling here in this section as well. If the Journal app doesn't meet your needs, here are some alternative suggestions:
How We Feel:
This is a free app designed by therapists, engineers and others wanting to help people understand their mental health. Packed with all kinds of features, the app makes it easier to track your mood, describe emotions, track relationships, and other factors important to mental wellbeing. It won an Apple award and, based on a brief examination, seems to be accessible to VoiceOver users.
    Understanding emotions is at the ore of this app. A lot of work has gone into making it easier to figure out what youfel and track factors using Healthkit which might contribute. Some early reviews of this app noted concerns about privacy. Before making extensive use of this app, take the time to read the current policy regarding your information.
Personal Diary:
Developed by Eng Tat Lim
    https://www.wernjie.com/personal-diary/
    Price: free in the app store
    Sometimes, you just want a simple free diary app which does what you need. Back in 2015, a teenaged app developer decided to create that. Even better, he made certain that his app worked well with VoiceOver. He has kept updating that app to this day. New features are added as experimental, so people who are interested in them can act as testers. Once a feature has been properly polished, it is then added to the standard features offered to everyone in the app.
    Keep in mind that this is a free app by a younger developer, learning as he goes. Nothing but personal pride, delight in creation, and a sense of responsibility to his largely happy users keeps him going. That's certainly good enough for me. The basic features are well established and working. However, if you choose to use the experimental ones like multiple journals, they're still being worked on and might not be as stable.
    It's another one of these apps with no tabs across the bottom. Everything is right on the main screen and different features will pop up when you double tap on the right button. There's an "edit button at the very top. A flick to the right of this is a heading called "timeline". To the right of this, you'll find a button called "settings". Next to this is the "add" button, which lets you add entries. The next thing is a search field, letting you look for entries in different ways. Past that, you'll find a heading which changes and asks questions like "how are you?" Or "What's new?" Past that, you can find and flick through all the entries you've made previously. It's cleverly simple to find your way around. Each entry title is a heading, so you can use the rotor to flick up or down between them.
    The capabilities here are very well laid out. Double tap the Add button, and you can then flick left or right to find the elements you want. There's actually a button called "editing help". You'll find the text field where you can type your entry. Also, you'll find a button for weather, mood, etc. This lets you choose the weather and your mood. Alternatively, you can have the app select those for you automatically using artificial intelligence. You will find pickers to change all of those aspects after double tapping that button. Once you're done writing the entry, simply double tap the "done" button. Everything works quite well with VoiceOver.
    There are options in the settings which are purely visual, such as the theme or size of text. These should be helpful to low vision users. Also, there are options such as whether you want entry preview text to show up in your timeline. You can choose to hide previews if you prefer. You can also choose whether the mood and weather can be chosen automatically. There are security settings to protect your diary. The spectrum of settings is excellent, even before you go into the experimental features settings. There's a help and support button as well as a tip jar if you want to support the developer financially.
    As far as free apps go, this one offers a splendid range of features while keeping things simple. It offers many things for free that other apps demand payment for. If you just want a simple diary app, this certainly delivers the goods. It even comes with a watch app which you can synch with and use the Flicktype keyboard to more easily type entries on the watch. Be certain to look in the experimental features section and provide feedback to the developer, so they can be worked on. Over time, more of the features become fully developed and leave the experimental section.
Day One Journal:
Developed by Bloom Built Inc.
    Www.dayoneapp.com
    ? Free to download with $5.49 or $46.99 monthly/annual pro subscription.
    This app has really stood the test of time well. It's been around since 2011 and has proved very popular among serious sighted journalers. Once they caught the accessibility bug, they have consistently kept everything accessible using VoiceOver. If you use VoiceOver hints, you'll hear short explanations as you flick over buttons and other elements in the app.
    Day One tries to be all things to all people. It has maintained its position at the top of its category by offering all sorts of premium features while keeping the subscription price affordable. People wanting to keep a diary and store moments or memories securely will find everything they might want. The basic free offer is more than good enough for people wishing to keep everything in one simple journal. You can make use of templates and daily prompts. Entries can have one photo added. Weather, location, activity and other things can be added to each entry. You can easily post entries to social media if you like.
    The layout is simple enough that you can get to everything by flicking left or right and double tapping on what you want. There are no ads or anything to get in your way. Everything is kept on a secure private server and only the device you've started a journal on can be used to add to or access it. You can, of course, upgrade to a new device and have that new device be the one with access.
    For people wanting more than what is freely offered, the pro subscription delivers all sorts of perks. You can keep unlimited journals. These can have unlimited photos and audio, as well as documents attached. The pro subscription gets you unlimited secure storage for your journals and anything attached to entries. That includes audio and video files, as well as documents. You can have PDF documents which can be scanned in. Audio entries are transcribed so they're searchable. The watch app lets you dictate entries right on your wrist. You get unlimited synching among your devices. There are other perks like bonus colours for your journals.
    You can find help and support at the Day One website:
    Www.dayoneapp.com
    There's a support section with many helpful articles. You can also learn about the app and the people who use it through the Day One podcast. There's also a thriving community of enthusiasts on Facebook. The pro subscription entitles you to customer support on a 24-hour basis.
    There are no tabs to worry about. At the top, there are a series of buttons. The journals, search, and More buttons come first. The journals button gives you options dealing with doing things to them as a whole. For instance, exporting a journal. The search button lets you search your entries for keywords or information. The more button gives you a set of options dealing with the current journal in focus. There are journal settings to help customize that particular journal, among other things. You'll find several buttons after that which let you immediately jump into a blank new entry to add text, photo, video, etc. If you know what you want to write or record, these are the buttons for you. If not, go down to the bottom of the screen. There, you'll find buttons to make reviewing your journal easier. There's a button to bring up an entry timeline, another for a timeline of stored media, a map of locations where you recorded your entries, and another to bring up a calendar. More importantly, you'll find the new entry menu button right in the middle of the bottom. This lets you access a menu of options including the daily prompt, special templates, or different media like drawing or audio. Just flick through the options and double tap on what you want. The daily prompt is included right in the menu, with an "answer" button one flick to the right of the question. Just double tap that and answer, or flick further right to find a button letting you start a blank text entry.
    The entry screens are easy to work with. You'll find text fields or whatever else you might need easily. There are buttons to let you control what additional information is saved along with entries you make if you want to control things on an individual basis. It has all been very well-thought-out to make journaling as easy a habit to get into as possible.
    If you're serious about documenting live events and keeping more than one journal, it's absolutely worth the price. Personally, though, I just haven't journaled to the degree that you'd need to, so you really made use of all the features. I'm a writer primarily, so all the video and audio capabilities went largely unused. However, if you wanted to document events and milestones with video and audio recording often, it's a small price to pay for the secure storage and abilities. Had I discovered it earlier, I may well have done more with it and kept paying the subscription.
Soundscapes:
Despite my moderate hearing loss, I frequently find having a well constructed soundscape playing in my AirPods to be a very useful thing. When you spend as much time in one place as I have over the past few years, there's often very little variety of ambient noise. Hearing different background sounds can break up the monotony and stimulate the mind. Alternatively, there may be noise which can't be escaped from, like when construction is happening in your building. My wife and I went through long stretches of this as the balconies were replaced over the course of a year. The vibration and pounding would shake the building, and the construction sounds would feel like they were cutting into your head at times. Soundscapes provide a different background noise of your choosing, which provides more mental relief than one might expect. Even I, who had the option of turning off my hearing aids and being positively thankful for the hearing loss which I had until then regarded as an unmitigated curse, was driven to utter distraction. Soundscapes add audio decoration, much as people with sight might put art up on their wall or trinkets on their desk. There are times when you don't really want music. It's typically designed to really catch and hold your attention. Sometimes, you just need more of a background ambience, which may change slowly over time. I can have the sounds of a busy café, the shore of a lake or ocean, a forest, or perhaps something more surreal like dreamy train noises. It can be totally private coming through my AirPods, or fill the apartment if I switch it to the HomePod Minis on my desk. Having that constant background noise can actually let me enjoy music at the same time while I'm working without it distracting me so much. The music changes, but the other background noise is more stable and constant.
    There are many apps which can provide you with soundscapes. Some allow greater control over aspects of what you hear than others. Apple added a background sounds feature to iOS, which you'll find in the accessibility settings. Just be certain to set the volume of the soundscape to low so that you can slowly bring it up and not find it suddenly impossible to hear VoiceOver. I carefully had to talk a lady who found herself in that circumstance through the steps to turn off the feature. It is quite possible to enjoy the soundscapes provided by this accessibility feature with VoiceOver, provided you get the relative volume levels right. Apple put the feature in to help people with ADHD and other conditions where a constant familiar sound can prove calming and conducive to less distraction. It is designed to interact with other audio played-from your device at the same time. For instance, the background sound would lower when you are also listening to someone speaking.
Nature Space:
This app gives you access to the Nature Space catalogue of soundscapes, letting you purchase and play them on your iOS device. The app is fully accessible and designed to work well with Voiceover. Nature Space developers are very aware of their blind audience. A demo and walkthrough by Scott Davert is available on the Applevis podcast. The app is free and comes with six soundscapes. Additional ones can be gotten through in-app purchases made in the Nature Space Catalogue.
    I use this app with Voiceover's audio ducking feature disabled. It can be jarring when the volume of your soundscape drops each time you take action on your iOS device. Use the rotor, turning it to the audio ducking setting, and flick up or down to turn the feature on or off.
    These soundscapes are recorded to give a good sense of space and are actual recordings of nature rather than artificially created. They are both a form of audio decoration and useful tools for people. It can be useful to have background sound which has variety but doesn't change volume or captivate the same way as music does. Sounds of waves or wind through trees can be relaxing and stimulating. Bird sounds can be energizing. Soundscapes can also help mask other sounds like construction noise. They're the audio equivalent of wallpaper. Engaging when focussed on, but can fade into the background of awareness.
    Your installed soundscapes start at the top left of the screen after the "Scroll to playing track" button. Double-tapping the button gets you near the track being played. Useful with a large collection of soundscapes. Flick left and right or use a three-fingered swipe up or down to get through your soundscapes as your collection gets bigger. Most of the rest of the main screen is all your installed soundscapes. Below these are seven buttons in a row:
    The Console button opens the console, where you can configure the Nature Space app to best serve you. Flick left and right to get through the settings. I prefer the "Mix audio with other apps" option set to on. This way, you can customize the Nature Space soundscape volume and find a good balance with your main system volume. You can then also play music at the same time. Other useful options include an "Airplay" button letting you switch between Bluetooth speakers, headphones or other devices. You can email for tech support, and there's also a button for deleting any previews of full tracks which are on your device. To close the console, use the "done" button at the top left.
    The "Share" button lets you use social media to share what soundscape you're currently listening to.
    The "Transitions Timer" lets you set timers designed to play sounds for helping you wake up or go to sleep. You can use both timers together, or just one of them.
    Four buttons over from the bottom left is the catalogue button. This is where you purchase additional soundscapes or download ones you've already purchased. You can easily navigate this area. There are headings you can flick up and down between using the rotor. Also, buttons for specific categories are there to help navigate the collection. In particular, check out the "Suggested use" button which presents additional buttons leading to collections of sound ideal for focussing, waking, sleeping and other things. The shopping experience couldn't be much easier. As usual, you'll find a particular soundscape, double-tap on it, find and tap on the button with the price of the track, and confirm your ID. When finished purchasing sounds or exploring the catalogue, use the "done" button at the top left to close it.
    To the right of the catalogue button are three more buttons. "Display full-screen image" will do just that, showing a picture related to the selected track. The "details" button brings up an information screen about the track being played. This has a description of the track, plus any notes about how it can be best used. The "display" or "hide" folder editing controls button gives you access to a mode which lets you organize and remove tracks from your device. If the editing controls are shown, there's a "reorder" button which lets you enter the mode where you can move and delete tracks. You can also create additional folders if it suits you. Normally, these controls should be hidden to reduce clutter. Use the "done" button when finished editing a folder, and then use the "hide folder editing controls" button at the bottom right to return to normal.
    Watch your storage space with this app if you don't have much to spare. Some soundscapes are fairly large and will fill a device with lower storage capacity rapidly. Don't be afraid to use the folder editing controls to remove soundscapes you don't want at the moment. You can always download them when you want them later. I have 29 different soundscapes installed, and they take up 647 MB. I often write with audio ducking off and a soundscape running with the Nature Space volume balanced nicely with my system volume. Some favourite soundscapes are:
    Walk to the Beach, Electric Desert Sunset, Equinox, Equatorial Midnight, Each Year, and Solstice.
MyNoise:
Produced by myNoise BVBA
    Available free in the app store with in-app purchases
    My Noise is a soundscape creator which lets you build and sculpt your ideal soundscape using component sounds called generators. A key aspect of the soundscapes created is that patterns don't ever repeat. Components of sounds are changed and played randomly so that your brain doesn't catch on repeated predictable loops unless you use a generator which intentionally has them. The app also lets you calibrate many soundscapes to compensate for hearing loss or mask bothersome environmental noise. You can use each generator on its own. For example, if I wanted a café soundscape, I could start that generator playing. However, you can also combine up to five generators to create a supergenerator. For instance, I could add a crackling fireplace, random piano music, and the sound of the Irish coast to add to the café ambience.
    While the accessibility of this app isn't as intuitive as it could be, the app is fully useable if you have VoiceOver hints enabled. Just wait a second after you land on and element and VoiceOver will say "possibly", whatever it is. That's new in iOS13, having VoiceOver try figuring out unlabelled controls. There are a few unlabelled buttons which voiceOver only hazards a guess at intermittently, such as the "play/pause" button. However, it's the last button farthest to the right before you reach the "Timer" and "Multi" buttons. All the sliders are perfectly accessible, although I have had occasions where VoiceOver jumps off a slider. Due to these kinds of issues, I would say take the time to explore the screens of this app and learn what things do. Your efforts will be rewarded.
    Each generator has ten sliders which control the volume of different components of that overall soundscape. Think of it a bit like an equalizer on a stereo. In some generators, that is precisely what those sliders actually are. Increasing the value will increase the amount of bass or treble frequencies in a soundscape. However, in many generators, each slider controls the volume of an aspect of the overall soundscape. This might consist of several sounds. For instance, the far-left slider controls the volume of bass restaurant rumble. Another couple of sliders are devoted to babble and chatter, another is for kitchen noises. Yet another is for table related sounds, like cutlery or plates being put down or moved. Some are for different types of restaurant, such as café versus a cocktail party. If you give your device a shake, the positions of the sliders will randomize. This is handy for changing things up a bit without having to leave the app you're working in while myNoise runs in the background.
    Don't panic at the thought of dealing with all the sliders. If you flick to the right of all the sliders past the "menu" button, you'll find a "my noises" option. Double tap on this and a new dialogue will pop up. This has presets for those sliders. When you first flick onto a picker, you'll hear VoiceOver say "random". Flick to the right, and you'll find an "I feel lucky" option. Flick up or down on this to keep changing the sliders randomly. For more intentional different presets, flick left onto the "random" picker and flick up. You will find a number of options, which usually include one called "scene" or "mood". Once that is selected, flick right to the right picker, which said, "I feel lucky" when random was selected. The contents of this right picker change depending on what the left one is set to. You'll find that flicking that upward yields a number of different choices. For instance, the café generator has options for chatter, the table in front, patrons only, and other presets. Once you selected the one you want, flick right to find the "select" button and double tap on that. If you find the volume isn't high enough, you can always adjust the sliders to more suitable levels, keeping their settings relative to each other the same to preserve the overall scene. There are actually buttons over to the right when a generator has been selected which let you raise or lower all the sliders by ten percent to achieve a good overall volume.
    Once you have a generator sounding the way you want it to, flick right and double tap on a button called "Multi". This brings up the supergenerator creation screen. You'll find a "back" button at the top left. Flick right a couple of times to find the "add generator" button. Double tap this, and you'll be presented with the list of all the generators available to you currently. I started with the café generator we covered earlier as a foundation. Next, I wondered where I wanted this place to be and found the "Irish Coast" generator. I double tapped on this, adding it to my supergenerator. Once you do this, examine the screen again, and you'll find buttons for each generator letting you either remove or customize the sound coming from it. Double tap on the "customize" button for a generator to bring up the sliders and options for it. When done customizing, flick right to the "multi" button to return to the supergenerator creation screen. You can add up to a maximum of five generators. I added the Irish coast generator to my café. Next, I added some singing bowls to give it a mystical feel. I had to customize that one to raise the volume of the bowl hits and eliminate the harmonic sliders. Next, I found a generator called Take it Easy, which had some nice electronic musical sounds. After adjusting those sliders to my liking, I return to the supergenerator creation screen by double tapping the "multi" button. Flicking all the way over to the right of this screen, I found the "save" button, which let my name and save my creation. I called it the Inspirations Seaside Café, and it's automatically added to the "Favourites" tab.
    There are five tabs in the app. From left to right, they are "my noises", "favourites", "Calibrations", "Downloads" and "More". You should take the time to explore all of these tabs for yourself. All the stuff we've talked about in terms of using single generators or creating supergenerators happens in the "My Noises" tab. If you find and double tap the "heart" button while on a particular generator's slider panel, you'll mark it as a favourite, and it'll be added to the "Favourites" tab. Given the large number of generators, this is very helpful.
    The "Menu" button lets you save additional presets of slider settings you like. Also, you can change the name of presets or delete ones you don't want. It may do more depending on context.
    Basically, the app itself is free and comes with a number of free generators. However, there are many additional generators which you can buy. Each generator costs $1.39. There's another option of buying all available generators plus any future additions for a one-time payment of $13.99. There are currently over 150 individual generators. The app celebrated its tenth year of existence in 2022 and more updates are being developed.
Rootd:
This app has garnered awards and special attention from Apple ap store editorial staff. It is designed to help people deal with anxiety and panic attacks. It provides lessons in everything from relaxation to breathing exercises to techniques for calming the mind. With image and text recognition enabled, I've found this app to be accessible for more experienced VoiceOver users. It really tries hard to get you to agree to a paid subscription. However, you can try a lot of the app's features at no cost if you're willing to deal with tis.
Habits With Henry:
Some apps called habit trackers are designed to help you develop good mental habits. One such app is called Habits with Henry. Henry is the name of a virtual pet kitten in the app who helps teach you the psychology of good habits. The app combines habit tracking with a kind of virtual pet game. You can unlock additional pets by doing well at sticking with your habits. Unlike other apps in this space, habits with Henry doesn't require an ongoing subscription. It costs around $6 Canadian.
    The developer of the app has been made aware of interest in the app from blind users. He has moved quickly to address accessibility problems for VoiceOver users. The app makes all kins of psychology information, motivation, and other resources available to you. People on the app store seem generally quite pleased with the app. You can learn more about it by visiting:

Other Mental Wellness Resources:
Our iPhones can help us to access many resources which can be as helpful for blind people as they are for the general population regarding our mental wellbeing. These resources will be ready and waiting to offer us information, comfort, and calm wherever we bring our iPhones. For me, the best examples are books, podcasts, online communities, and music. These are things which you can access easily and often at no cost on your iPhone.
    Thanks to my iPhone and the trust put in its security by book publishers, I can easily obtain the latest books on mental health and wellness. One weekend in February 2022, I heard a show on CBC Radio called Sunday Magazine. The interviewed Johann Hari, the author of Stolen Focus. It's a book all about how to regain our lost ability to really pay deep attention to things. I was able to make a note of the book title and find it on Kindle. It's also available on Audible and likely other accessible places like CELA. A podcast clued me into another book by Julie Smith called Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before. It's a book by a clinical psychologist just published this January. In it, she lays out the basics of what we know about various things like managing grief, keeping motivated, dealing with low moods, and much more. Another CBC show had an interview with Jennifer Buchanan. She's a music therapist who wrote Wellness Well-played: The Power of a Playlist. If you need scientific proof to justify the time you spend listening to music, look no further. Thanks to my iPhone, I was able to purchase all three of these books on Kindle and even make certain before I did so that they would be fully accessible to me. When we hear about a resource like a book which interests us, chances are excellent that we will be able to get it right away when it actually might apply to our current situation.
    There are a great many podcasts which are made to give people help dealing with all sorts of mental wellness issues. Since they're entirely an auditory form of expression, blind people will face no difficulties accessing them. One of my more recent discoveries is a podcast called On Purpose with Jay Shetty. He explores all kinds of interesting aspects of the mind. There are over 300 episodes, which typically seem to be around an hour long. Everything from six mistakes we make when communicating in our close relationships to how to deal with anxiety. The Cram Podcast explores ideas and research that doesn't always get widely publicized, but could change how we live our lives. A recent episode dealt with insomnia and getting a good night's sleep. Podcasting has given space for many experts with some time to spare to share their thoughts freely on all kinds of things, including mental issues.
    Your iPhone gives you easy access to online communities and social media. Connection with others via these methods shouldn't be thought of as a perfect substitution for in person contact with other people. However, when opportunities for such in person contact are unavailable, the ability to keep in contact from a distance has largely proved to be a blessing. Certainly, a mixed one. I often advise people who are new to social media to approach it with a thick skin. Humanity at its best and worst can be found in the global village.
    This is why I believe that people seeking safe and positive connections while in any kind of mental distress might better be served by joining smaller, more moderated communities. The keys here are the size of the community and whether there's moderation or other defensive options if you find yourself being attacked. Pretty much anybody can follow you on X, Facebook or other platforms. If you're basically in a good frame of mind, I think there's a lot of value to be found in social media like Twitter. I have many followers who I genuinely respect and have had some great conversations. However, it's hard to completely avoid the trolls and really negative people on these platforms. With smaller communities, there's more connection between participants and more of an incentive to keep things civil and positive. A relatively small, safe group of people who regularly get together for conversation can do wonders for one's mood.
    Many organizations have offered virtual meetings, which people can register to attend freely. For example, the CNIB has been offering many virtual programs to teach skills and discuss various subjects over Zoom. Having that regular contact with a moderated group of people with at least one shared interest can be very helpful. I also participate in Zoom discussions offered by the CCB. I actually lead one of their discussions once a month, all about iOS apps, games, and entertainment. Over time, you get to know the people who attend such groups, and this can be very helpful in maintaining a positive outlook on life. There are also many online forums and email lists people can join. Look to be certain that there are community rules and procedures in place for when people break those rules.
    And then, there's music. Everyone has their favourite songs or artists. Music is often turned to in times of upheaval to give comfort and solis. These days, I mainly use the Music app included in iOS. I've made playlists of instrumental and pop music which I like. Even if you would rather not do that work, there are many radio stations and curated playlists available through Apple Music. Using Siri, you can ask it to play any radio station you can think of. It'll look in directories of TuneIn and iHeart Radio, among others, to try to find stations you ask for. I find it's always good to add the word "radio station" to the end of your command when you want to hear one of those. Alternatively, you can specify which app a radio station is available from. If you tell Siri to "Play my radio station", it will generate a station for you based on music that it thinks you like. If that isn't an ego boost, I don't know what is.

Internet Radio and Podcasts:
Your iPhone or iPad, with help from Bluetooth speakers or headsets, can be a tremendously portable gateway to all kinds of stimulating audio entertainment and community. Outside of audiobooks and dramas sold by companies directly to consumers, the only things it may cost you are storage space on your device and the data used to download or stream content. Presuming you are satisfied with what Apple provides on your device, you can potentially tap into Internet radio and podcasts without spending any money at all. For more hardcore enthusiasts, there are various third-party apps that offer additional features to enhance listening and let you tune into countless radio stations and subscribe to podcasts. More podcasts are being produced which require paying subscriptions to access. As a result, the terminology surrounding podcasts in particular is undergoing some change. Podcasts can be "followed" for no cost which mens that you'll get any free content they offer. Subscribing to a podcast will unlock access to additional content available to paid subscribers. This might give access via special feed to longer episodes, bonus content such as interviews with creators, or other perks.
    The Internet is the wild west of broadcasting and publishing. The costs to produce and stream content are low enough that practically anyone who is interested can participate and publish content. Enthusiasts can create Internet radio stations broadcasting exclusively via the Internet rather than via radio waves. Most actual radio stations these days will also allow you to listen via the Internet. This offers the advantage of perfect reception, provided your Internet connection is good, and you have the necessary bandwidth.
    Using email and other social media tools such as Facebook, Mastodon or X, people can go beyond merely listening and interact with each other as well as content creators. This opens up tremendous possibilities for helping to make content better, make new friends online who share your interests, and offer any talents or knowledge you might have to help others. Many blind people have decided to become involved in broadcasting on Internet radio stations or in the creation of podcasts. It is now possible to do this content creation using apps on your iOS device.
    Podcasts are shows you can follow or subscribe to. As the shows are released, you can stream or download them from the Internet to your iOS device using an app built for this purpose. There are podcasts about any subject you might imagine. This includes everything from audio storytelling and drama, to podcasts about blindness-related information, to podcasts about sports, culture, and mythology. The sheer amount of content available in podcast form is breathtaking and usually free for anybody to listen to. Using recording apps and services on the Internet, it's possible to create podcasts using only your iOS device, although accessories and the right apps can drastically improve sound and overall quality.
    In this section, I'll share some of my treasured experiences and discoveries exploring both of these mediums. I'll also cover the facilities Apple has included related to podcasts and radio listening.
    iOS 13 introduced major developments, making it possible to use Siri in conjunction with the Music app to tap into Internet radio. They also provide an app called Podcasts that allows you to subscribe to and enjoy countless podcasts available online. This makes it easy for new users of iOS devices to simply jump in and start listening. Further refinements were made in iOS 15, particularly to the Podcasts app. It now offers the ability to support and access podcasts through subscribing to them. However, there are many third-party apps that preceded Apple deciding to up its game in these areas of audio entertainment. These apps offer compelling capabilities to make exploring what's out there and listening even more pleasant. I will discuss my preferred apps for accessing this content and explain why you might want to look at other options when you could do it all free of any costs.
    Please realize that there is a mind-boggling amount of choice in this space. There are many podcast apps as well as those for listening to Internet radio on your device which can be obtained from the app store. And then, there's enough actual content to consume multiple lifetimes. Even with nothing else to do, there would be no way that I could keep up with all the podcasts and Internet radio shows that cater to my particular interests. All the apps I'll present in this section have facilities to help you seek content and learn about what's currently available.
    The station and podcast examples I'll use when describing how to use various apps have been chosen to maximize the benefits of taking the time to listen even before you know how to interact. At the end of the portion of this section devoted to Internet radio, you'll find a list of stations that are either my favourites to listen to or are stations particularly helpful to blind people. Similarly, you'll find a list of podcasts awaiting you at the end of the part of this section devoted to them. If nothing else, I hope this gives newcomers a good place to start. Things do change over time. Podcasts come and go. Also, some content is Geoblocked and may not be available in your area for that reason. Typically, this has to do with copyright and marketing restrictions. While there's no charge to listeners for this content apart from data and possible subscription costs, money is certainly needed to produce it. I live in Canada, so the resources I feature here will reflect this. As far as I know, they should be available in most places. A great many originate outside of Canada. That being said, let's dive right in.
Internet Radio:
A SocialSonic Springboard:
    The day had finally arrived. It was April 27, 2012, when I found an email awaiting me. The time had come for the Mushroom FM Weekend Virtual Birthday Cruise. It was by far their biggest, most intricate celebration event ever staged at the time. For long-time listeners like me, it was very much a cause for anticipation and excitement. I made certain my weekend was clear of any other plans, wanting to catch as much of this as possible.
    There was, of course, no need to pack for this "weekend away". The event took place online and in the cheerful minds of its participants, who were in many countries around the world. The good ship Fungus was an imaginary construct reinforced by the willing suspension of disbelief, aided by well-crafted sound effects. Our cabins were identity numbers allowing for easy tallying of correct trivia answers, votes cast, etc. The virtual rooms were hosted by the station show hosts and staff to the delight of all involved. Sitting comfortably at home or wherever we happened to be, we could, nonetheless, participate in this fifty-five hour continuous audio party.
    Only a year into my iPhone experience, I took part mainly through my desktop computer. The speakers filled my apartment with the proceedings of the virtual cruise. Well-picked music was interspersed with interludes complete with atmospheric shipboard background sound effects where the current host would update everyone on contests, ask participation and trivia questions, conduct poles, etc. Anybody at all could tune in and listen. However, registration before the event meant that you had a cabin onboard and could partake in the more interactive elements of the experience, including contests and votes. This was done via social media including Twitter, Facebook, and via email. Hashtags were used on X, which was where people had ongoing conversations and participated with the hosts most frequently. Hashtags allowed people to find messages from participants they weren't already following. Also, emails from people not on social media and updates on some of the conversation happening on X were read on the air. This event served to powerfully demonstrate the potential of the Internet to bring people together. I still converse with friends I made on X during that weekend of extended broadcasting. Many people who normally only interacted with others who listened to the same shows were exposed to different hosts and audience members they may not have otherwise encountered. The result was a stronger community of listeners and lasting online friendships.
    If the same event took place now, I would participate entirely through my iPhone. At home, I could use smart-speakers to hear the event broadcast. If I was somewhere else, I could just as easily hear the event via earbuds or pair my iPhone with Bluetooth speakers to share it with others. Social media and email apps are very accessible, so I could participate fully through my iPhone. Ideally, I'd use a physical Bluetooth keyboard for typing. For times when I was away from handy wall sockets, a power bank and charging cable would complete my desired equipment.
    Marathon Events like the virtual cruise I described above are relatively rare. They require a lot of dedicated effort to pull off. For event creators and hosts, the more game or interactive elements there are in an event, the more effort and skill are needed to bring them off satisfactorily. My wife Sara has become deeply involved in the Mushroom FM internet radio station. She hosts two regular shows, including one that happens every weekday. During the final weekend before I published the first edition of this guide, April 25th and 26th of 2020, Mushroom FM celebrated its 10th birthday. The main event of these celebrations was Mushroomstock 2020. Modelled after the legendary Woodstock festival, this twelve-hour event featured live recordings made by groups who had already passed on or else couldn't reunite and play together. I got a peek behind the scenes, or ... sounds in this case, as Sara prepared for her three-hour slot where she would host proceedings. A lot of work goes into fine-tuning the crowd noise used during portions between the music when you hear from the various show hosts and broadcasters involved. There's all the work selecting acts comprised of live recordings possibly performed at different events and making it all sound like it fits naturally into the same event held at a completely fictitious Fungus Field. Where else would Mushroom FM hold a music festival?
    For audience members participating in such events, the bar is much lower. Of course, they need whatever skills that doing well in a particular event demands. Also, they need to be familiar enough with whatever social media platform is being used to facilitate interaction to use it quickly. Some events are conducted with Zoom or other group-conferencing platforms, letting participants simply talk to the hosts and each other. Other times, recorded or typed communication is expected via email or Twitter. This lets creators have more control over what gets broadcast. It can also allow for easier private conversation to occur off-air between audience members tuned into the broadcast.
    For many blind and visually impaired people, social isolation can be a major issue. Finding people with similar interests and experiences can be tricky. One approach to hooking up with others is through Internet radio stations. Nothing can replace spending time with people who are physically present. However, many meaningful and worthwhile relationships have grown out of participation with communities of listeners that form around shows and stations accessible freely online. Neither transportation nor a lack of funds will stop you from participating and contributing meaningfully to the communities that grow around stations and shows. All you need is your iOS device, an Internet connection, and your preferred accessories for listening and typing. If you're unfamiliar with social media, please see the section in this guide titled A Truly Global Village. If you aren't quite feeling ready to plunge into that just yet, fear not. Most Internet radio stations will have email addresses that you can use to give feedback at a minimum. Many broadcasters will even check emails while a show is happening and read them to listeners along with activity from social media platforms. Interaction is a major reason for them to produce broadcasts. They are usually keen to offer assistance and encouragement to newcomers.
Apple's Approach to Internet Radio Enjoyment
If you've read the section about the Apple Music app, you'll know that Apple steers you towards its own curated group of radio stations. They currently run three flagship stations. Apple Music 1 focusses exclusively on current and brand-new music. On that station, you'll find a lineup of live and prerecorded shows hosted by professional DJs as well as big names in the music industry, including Elton John. The Apple Music Hits station concentrates on older popular music. As with Apple's other stations, it features shows produced by top-notch talent familiar with the songs and the people behind them. Finally, Apple music Country gives fans of that genre of music the same caliber of curated content and live shows. Each station streams twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Each station has a schedule of shows. If you miss a favourite show, fear not. Simply go into the schedule, double tap on the show name and find the episode you missed in the content page for that show.
    In early 2020, scrolling around the contents of tabs in the Music app wasn't as easy as it should be, thanks to issues with VoiceOver focus and stability. Things have improved substantially over the past two years. Scrolling through the contents of the tabs still isn't as intuitive as it should be. People will need to make use of the vertical bar on the right side of the screen to jump past points and then use the rotor turned to headings. I've found that VoiceOver keeps being unable to move to headings lower down in the tab until they're actually on the screen to begin with. This means that you'll have to scroll up and down or flick right over songs until that heading is present. Alternatively, you may need to get to the heading below the one you're interested in and then flick left to find content near the bottom of the heading of interest. You'd simply jump over it going the other way. Beginners should know that the struggle you're having isn't a lack of proficiency on your part.
    Presuming you can explore and use that tab normally, you will find headings such as Recently Played, Apple Music Radio, Radio by Genre, and many more.
    A lot of that tab is taken up by information and shows broadcast on the three Apple Music stations. This is one way you can find out about shows offered on the stations. To explore beyond these, you first need to get past this. Simply double tap on a show to reach its show page. There, you can read a bit about the show and double tap on an episode to start listening. Apple throws substantial resources into this content. Finding other content such as third-party terrestrial stations broadcasting music or news can be somewhat tricky. There are headings called "Local Radio", "Worldwide Radio", and others. There are also buttons which get you into various genres of station. Things could and should be a lot more intuitive, but as of iOS, 15 in 2022, it is possible to get at all of the contents in the Radio tab.
    Once you start a station or show playing, the standard playback screen pops up. With prerecorded shows, you can move around as normal. However, you can't skip things during live shows. Simply use the Dismiss button to go back to the Radio tab and hide the playback screen. With Apple's three music stations, using the "Play" buttons after the "schedule" links will start the station playing without maximizing the player. This works similarly to when you double tap on a top song from an artist under the "top songs" heading, and it just starts playing.
    The Radio tab is only one of two ways Apple has provided to bring endless wonderful radio to your ears. The other is to simply look for stations through other means, such as Google, and then simply tell Siri what you want to hear. One advantage of this is that you don't even have to leave the app you're in to start something playing or change what you're hearing to something else. Another big plus is that Siri can tap into many directories of radio station streams to find what you're hoping to hear. It then simply starts playing the station in the Music app. Wait around five to ten seconds after this happens, and the Siri dialogue window will close, leaving you wherever you were before invoking Siri. You can always use the home screen gesture or Home button, depending on your model of iOS device, to escape this window more quickly.
    For our first example, let's say you want to hear what's currently playing on AMI Audio. This audio stream is broadcast on Canadian television. This makes it easier for those unconnected to the Internet to tune in and be informed and entertained. You can learn more about the shows and content you'll hear by going to www.amiplus.ca.
    To access this stream using Siri, you first need to invoke Siri by saying "hey Siri" if you've enabled this, or by holding down the Action button on your device until you hear a short beep. Once you've heard the beep, simply say "play AMI Audio radio station". If Siri doesn't recognize your request properly, try saying the letters separately, like you'd do with an acronym like CIA. Siri will then emit a short beep to indicate that it has stopped listening and parsed your request. If all went well, you should then start hearing whatever happens to be on AMI Audio at the moment. I've found that adding the words "radio station" to a request to hear one helps avoid occasions where a song or artist have similar sounding names.
    Once you've played a station in this manner, that station is recorded in the Music app under the Recently Played heading found in both the For You and the Radio tabs. This makes it easy to tune in again by double tapping on any stations beneath that heading. This is useful when you don't wish to disturb anyone around you by speaking to Siri. The more stations you listen to, the more is added beneath that heading. Eventually, if you don't listen to a given station, it gets pushed down farther beneath the heading. Eventually, it may no longer be there at all.
Advantages of Third-Party Listening Apps
Not everyone is satisfied with Apple's approach to Internet radio. Station exploration beyond Apple's curated set of choices is harder to do. Many people won't see this as a problem, since they can just ask Siri to play whatever station they want to hear. However, actually finding out about what else is out there waiting for your discovery can't really be done with the Music app. You could certainly use Google or word of mouth to find out about new stations. However, you then need to hear these stations to get them recorded as Recently Played, or keep your own list, perhaps in a Notes app. Also, people may want to keep a stable list of their favourites that doesn't change based on how often they listen to things. They might want to search for stations within a specific city they're visiting so they can get a feel for what the locals are hearing. Third-party apps designed for Internet radio listening offer this kind of benefit and others to increase your enjoyment. Many of these are free to download but are supported by ads. Others are sold as subscription services to access all of their features. Other apps charge a one-time fee up front that entitles you to all future updates. Let's look at a few of these apps that are accessible and have been kept up to date as iOS has changed. We'll start with a well established app which has become a favourite for me thanks to a tip from a reader named Dennis Long.
The Eter App:
This app is a nice and simple option for browsing what's available publically and freely all over the world in terms of online radio. A one-time payment of around $12 Canadian unlocks all features including the ability to keep a list of favourite stations. The app can be used freely if you don't mind searching for stations each time you want to hear them. Once you've paid the price and added some favourites, you can use the multimedia keys on your keyboard or the controls on your headset or EarPods to skip betwen stations or pause playback.
    The directory of stations used by this app seems very up to date. However, another advantage of this app is that you can add stations if you know their URL. Finding out what those are can be a bit of a stretch. It's not the home page for the station you need, but the direct link to the streaming feed.
    While you may well hear advertising from stations or from the streaming companies making their broadcast available online, the Eter app doesn't use ads to support its ongoing development. Things are kept very simple. Another perk of this app is its ability to detect the name of songs playing and letyou open right to them in the Music app. You can then add the song, artist, albums, etc, to your music library on the Apple Music Plus service. Very handy indeed.
The Triode Internet Radio App:
Triode was created by the Icon Factory. These independent app developers have demonstrated their commitment to making their apps accessible to blind people. They are most widely known for the Twitterrific app. While this app has been rendered useless due to radical changes at X, it was long regarded as the best most accessible Twitter experience available. The Triode app can be downloaded and tried out free. However, a subscription is needed to unlock all of its features. Alternatively, you can pay a one-time fee of around $27 Canadian. This helps to support the continued development and maintenance of the app.
    The interface for this app is somewhat more traditional than ooTunes and makes use of tabs. Things are nicely laid out and easy to explore. So far, the directory of stations has contained everything I've thought to search for. You can maintain a list of favourites and switch between them using the multimedia buttons on your headset or keyboard. The app is very polished and definitely worth checking out.
    We'll use Mushroom FM as your example here. This station is a kind of shared hobby for its famous owner, Jonathan Mosen. It's a way to give back to the blind community. He has several people who help out with broadcasting their own shows. Jonathan has his own popular show every weekday called Mosen Explosion which features music and other items of interest. Jonathan pays much of the cost of running the station, and community members help out when needed. To tune into this station:
    First, double tap on the Triode app to get it running. Next, feel across the bottom of the screen until you find a Find a Station tab. Double tap this. Once you're in this tab, feel near the top of the screen to find a search field. Double tap this and enter "Mushroom FM" in the field. Even if you just enter "Mushroom", you should find it among the search results. Flick right through the results and then double tap on the one you want to hear. It should start playing. Be certain to examine the playing screen that pops up and add Mushroom FM to your favourites. You can learn more and check out the schedule to find shows that interest you by visiting www.mushroomfm.com.
The TuneIn Radio App
Another very popular app is TuneIn Radio. This app can be used to listen to stations for free. One can also keep a list of favourite stations. When used in free mode, listeners will hear advertising that is above and beyond that normally heard on the stations themselves. These ads are inserted by TuneIn Radio, and revenue from them helps maintain the app and extensive station directory. This directory is also used by many other services such as Google, Siri, and Amazon, allowing them to play radio stations found in the TuneIn directory.
    If listeners want to ditch the ads that clutter the screen of the app as well as one's ears, they can pay for a subscription. This will remove the ads and offer other benefits. These include tuning into sports broadcasts, reading a selection of audiobooks, and more. The app is well laid out and presents no known difficulties to blind people when it comes to accessibility.
    For people in the UK, the RNIB offers many services. One of these is a radio station available online. To listen to RNIB Connect Radio, launch the TuneIn Radio app. Next, double tap on the Search button found near the bottom right of the home screen. You'll then find a search field where you can enter "RNIB". In addition to the station itself, RNIB makes the shows available as podcasts. TuneIn Radio can be used to subscribe to and hear podcasts if desired. However, there's a heading in the results called Stations. Underneath that heading, you'll find the RNIB Connect station. Rather than feeling beneath a heading, you can simply flick right past the heading and onto the contents underneath. Double tap on the RNIB Connect station, and it will begin playing. You can add it to your favourites if you wish.
Further Notes on Listening to Internet Radio
When tuning in via the Internet, keep in mind that there are times when technical issues will make stations temporarily unavailable. Don't give up on a station just because it doesn't happen to connect. It may just be down temporarily. The fault could be with the Internet generally or with the specific carrier or server that hosts the station you want to hear. Also, these are typically small operations. The broadcasters or owners may be experiencing difficulties.
    The list of favourite stations below doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what's available. Traditional broadcasters, large corporations, and all kinds of enthusiasts make a staggeringly broad range of stations available. These can be heard using the apps covered above, or simply through your Internet browser of choice. Most of these stations have their own websites where you can learn more about them. For instance, you can find their broadcast schedules and what shows are available. Also, you will usually be able to find out about the broadcasters and other people behind the station. Most of them are run by people with their own agendas and interests. They are happy to be contacted by their listeners and will respond to inquiries or comments.
    Another excellent thing to look into is whether your local public radio service has produced apps that help you explore their offerings. For Canadians, the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) has produced a wonderfully accessible app called CBC Listen. This app lets you tune into their live radio stations from across the country. Also, it has separate tabs for exploring a range of music playlists and a growing number of podcasts. You can also hear your favourite radio shows on demand if you happen to miss them. It's a very well-built app, and they've put in the effort to make certain that users of VoiceOver have an easy and enjoyable time.
    Over in Britain, the BBC has made a similar app called BBC Sounds. They are world-famous for audio drama production as well as wonderful comedy, among a great deal else. They also deeply care about their blind audience. Any apps they produce will be accessible to VoiceOver.
    In the US, the NPR (National Public Radio), is the closest equivalent that I'm aware of to our CBC. They have also produced an app to help people enjoy their audio offerings that include some incredible podcasts. You can find the NPR app in the app store.
    If you enjoy any other terrestrial radio stations that you hear locally or while travelling elsewhere, use Siri or one of the apps discussed above to search for it. You may find that it's available as an online broadcast. I was thrilled to discover that a favourite local news source, CP24, was available as an audio stream online. I used to tune in regularly while I had a TV, and it was one of a very few channels I've ever actually missed since I stopped watching TV. Having the audio available through Siri or the iHeart Radio app, among others, was a very pleasant surprise.
    The RadioPlayer Canada app has a directory of over four hundred radio stations, which are part of a collective group that sponsored the development of this app. AMI Audio can be heard on it as well as on other Internet radio apps.
Favourite Internet Radio Stations:
Here are some other wonderful Internet radio stations you might enjoy listening to. These are not in any particular order. I've certainly appreciated them over the years and hope to continue finding more stations. Keep exploring for yourself and share what you discover with others.
    680 News Radio:
    This station is also known as "city news radio". It's a twenty-four-hour news station on the AM dial and available in much better sound quality via the web. Normally, it cycles through brief checks on headlines, weather, traffic and other categories. You never have to wait long for something you're interested in being updated about. It also breaks from this pattern to carry live events like important press conferences. A very handy way to catch up with what's happening in a hurry.
    Team FM
    www.team-fm.com
    This station is run by blind music enthusiasts who want to put a positive spin on things. They share their knowledge in-between endless good music from all eras. It's all about creating a positive, cheerful community for these folks.
    Radio Rivendell
    www.radiorivendell.com
    If you've ever wished that your life had an epic soundtrack to go along with it, this is the station for you. It plays a constant stream of instrumental music from movies and video games. It leans heavily in the fantasy adventure direction. A lot of the music is from video game and movie scores, and they also feature independent instrumental composers. I've rarely disliked more than one song in a row that they've played. This station makes for a great background while writing or playing a tabletop RPG with your friends.
    Cornucopia Radio
    www.cornucopia-radio.co.uk
    Based in England, this group goes to different local venues to record audio dramas. They employ local talent and also make use of voice actors from all over the world. The range of material streamed on this station is tremendous. It's all fun and mostly quirky.
    Mushroom FM and Mushroom Escape
    www.mushroomfm.com
    I've already discussed Mushroom FM above. However, it's so spectacular that it deserves another mention. There's no better place for that than right here where I also tell you about its companion station Mushroom Escape. This station brings you a steady stream of classic and modern audio drama and comedy. Run by enthusiasts who deeply care about audio entertainment, you'll find lots to laugh at and think about whenever you need an escape.
Podcasts: Fascinating and Portable Stimulation:
I've enjoyed podcasts for years now, just about as long as I've enjoyed Internet radio. However, while I can clearly remember the first Internet radio station I ever listened to, I can't say the same for podcasts. I strongly suspect that it would have been the Main Menu show, which was made into a podcast that I first heard on ACB Radio. This show and podcast is still being produced today, well over ten years after I first came across it.
    Unlike radio stations, podcasts aren't heard live. They are audio files of complete episodes or shows published on RSS feeds online. They're great for when you don't really want to dig into a book or can't afford to. If I'm going on a trip or might be offline for a while, I'll be certain to download a bunch, so I have lots to listen to. I've often been surprised at just how much excellent listening gets put out there and completely escapes mainstream notice.
    There's no regulation when it comes to podcasts. Absolutely anything goes. Ordinary people can just decide to record podcasts on their computer or smartphone and stick them out there through a podcast hosting company. Some popular podcasts are sponsored or produced by companies as advertising vehicles. It's a very diverse and wide world to explore. Gifted amateurs frequently end up building massive, loyal audiences just as large or larger than corporate-produced efforts. Word about exceptional listening does seem to spread.
    To listen to podcasts, you need a podcast player. Apple has provided you with one that is included in iOS. We will cover it in detail along with related settings found in the Settings app. There are many suitable alternatives in the app store. We'll look at three of these.
    A quick note of podcast terminology: Apple has begun to differentiate between "following" podcasts versus "subscribing" to them. This is an attempt to draw a helpful distinction between podcasts you "follow" and listen to freely versus those podcasts you need to pay a subscription in order to hear. There is an increasing amount of such paid content which goes well beyond that offered through Apple's Podcast Plus service. More podcast creators are asking for paid subscriptions to cover their costs, rather than relying entirely on sponsors or voluntary donations. In exchange, subscribers typically receive perks like having no advertisements interrupting the podcasts or early access to episodes. Outside of Apple's Podcast Plus service, people would typically visit the website of a podcast in order to find the means to subscribe. They would then get a link in their email to a special feed meant for subscribers only.
    You'll notice my list of podcasts at the end of this section is much larger than that of Internet radio stations. The main reason for this is that you don't need to find many stations to have more than enough interesting content. Podcasts are far easier to fit into life, and good ones really tend to stick in the brain. Even so, I subscribe to more podcasts than I could ever hope to keep up with. This way, there's always a choice of intriguing podcasts waiting for me. To get started, let's take a look at the Podcasts app that is included with iOS and already on your device.
The Podcasts App:
This is a free app made by Apple. Chances are that it's already present on your device. If not, you can simply download it from the app store. There are no ads or in-app purchases to worry about initially. It's a very stripped down, simple app, uncluttered by extra bells and whistles. The layout and controls are basic. If you're still learning VoiceOver and starting from scratch in your exploration of podcasts, you will likely find that this free app more than meets your needs. It's a great one for beginners to practice on while they learn VoiceOver.
    The introduction of iOS 11 set a new direction in design when it comes to digital media. Following in the footsteps of the Music app, the app store and Podcasts app are all now very similar in layout and operation. This makes for good consistency, which can really be helpful for beginners. Presuming they can master the app store or Apple Music, the new design is so similar that they shouldn't have any problems using the Podcasts app.
    One way in which this app 
    Stands apart is that it grants you access to podcasts which make use of Apple's Podcast Plus service. Rather than the typical model of paying one flat fee to unlock everything, this service works differently. It allows you to subscribe to individual podcasts or whole channels of podcasts. Channels are collections of podcasts which have been grouped together to form a network. Paying a subscription for a channel would grant you access to any subscriber versions of podcasts associated with that channel. In most cases, it is possible to listen to free versions of the podcasts without the benefits given to paid subscribers. This isn't always the case, though. Once you've subscribed to one or more podcasts and channels, you can manage those subscriptions in your account, accessed from the "account settings" button found in the top-left corner of the "Home" tab.
    There are four tabs across the bottom of the Podcasts app. The tabs are Home on the far left, Browse, Library, and Search on the far right. So far, so simple. Let's take a closer look at these tabs in order.
Home:
This first tab has numerous headings dividing the contents. The top heading us "up next". This is where you'll find the latest episodes of podcasts you've recently listened to. There are also headings for the top shows on any channels you might subscribe to. Other headings will be overtop of podcasts recommended by artificial intelligence or based on what people are finding appealing. The "My Channels" heading precedes a section containing all of the channels you're paying to subscribe to.
    The "account settings" button at the top of this tab provides you with access to several settings which are useful when dealing with podcasts. You'll find a button for managing your subscriptions. This takes you to the subscription management area of your account, where you can cancel or change any subscriptions you've entered into. Another button lets you access notification settings connected to the podcasts and channels you follow or subscribe to. For each podcast, you'll find a toggle to turn notifications on or off.
    Besides headings dealing with your channels, there are others which will offer suggestions for additional podcasts or channels you may find interesting. These recommendations are based on what Apple's artificial intelligence thinks you might like based on what it learns of your preferences as you listen. Below these headings near the bottom of the tab's contents, you'll find a "recently played" heading. Below this, you'll find the latest episodes from podcasts you have listened to lately.
Browse:
The Browse tab is very much like the one in the Music app. You'll find a series of buttons. There's a Browse heading at the top of the screen. You'll also find several additional headings, which will change as more podcasts appear and Apple changes what it wants to draw people's attention to. The tab is about making you aware of what others are enjoying so that you have a chance to get in on the action that might lie outside your typical interests. Flick left and right through the various buttons and double tap on what interests you.
    At the very bottom of the tab, you'll find a heading called "Podcast quick links". Beneath this heading, you'll find tools to allow for wider exploration by various categories. There are buttons called "Browse by category", and a button to access charts of top podcasts in various categories. You will also find a button letting you follow Apple Podcasts on X.
Library:
The Library tab is more complex. You can view by show or episode, look at only things that are downloaded to your iOS device, remove shows or episodes, etc. A lot of that is accessed via the Edit button near the top of the screen. Next to that are Show and Episode buttons, so you can choose which you want to focus on. Next, you'll find a handy heading labelled Recently Updated. Shows or episodes are normally in chronological order. Double tap on a show or episode to select it, just like in the Listen Now tab. Once you're down to the episode level and double tap on the episode you would like to hear, flick right, and you'll find Play and Download buttons as well as a full description and show notes. You're never stuck anywhere. A Back button is always at the top left if you're inside a show or episode. Remember to press the Play button to start an episode playing.
Search:
This tab is typical of ones bearing its name. You can decide to search all podcasts or just the ones in your library. Other than that, there's simply an edit field to type in your search terms. To the right of this is a list of current popular searches.
Episode Playback:
During playback of an episode, you can have the app in the background while doing other things, just like with the Music app. In fact, things are kept precisely similar. A player screen will pop up, hiding the four tabs. The episode will start playing, and you'll find a Dismiss Player button at the top left. There are play controls including buttons to skip forward or backward by fifteen seconds, share what you're listening to, change the playback destination to connected devices, etc. You will also find podcast show notes and a list of chapters if a podcast has these. There are buttons to skip to previous and next chapters if a podcast has these. Also, you'll find a list of chapters you can flick left and right through. Double tap on a chapter title to jump immediately to it.
Podcast Settings:
You'll find a selection of options in the Settings app that let you configure the Podcasts app in important ways. As with other apps, you can specify how notifications from this app will appear. As there may very well be many new episode notifications, it's essential to be able to control this separate from other apps. You can also choose whether the Podcasts app can refresh in the background, checking for new episodes while you go about your day. You can also select whether the app can use cellular data. If you're on a limited data plan, this is an excellent ability to have.
    If you have more than one iOS device, you can decide to have podcasts synced across any devices connected to iCloud. You could start playing on one device and switch to another, such as a HomePod speaker. Another setting lets you block downloads over cellular data. This way, you can use a minuscule amount of data checking for new episodes but not have to worry about them downloading until you're on Wi-Fi.
    The Continuous Playback option lets you select whether episodes in the Up Next queue will play automatically one after another. This can be great for long drives or stretches where you just want interesting things to hear with a minimum of fuss.
    A heading called Episode Downloads precedes these next options, which allows you to take further control of what gets downloaded when. The first option under this heading lets you specify how often new episodes are checked for. The default setting is every hour. Remember that you don't have to download podcasts to play them. You can simply stream them provided you're connected to Wi-Fi or have cellular data. If you want to stream episodes and not have them take up space on your device, simply set the Downloads toggle to "off".
    Once episodes have downloaded to your device, it's important to manage that content and clear out old episodes. You don't have a lot of control here. There's a single switch that provides an option to delete downloaded episodes twenty-four hours after they're played. All other management will need to be done from the library.
    Another group of settings lets you change how skip buttons work. These let you skip chunks of an episode you're hearing or skip to other episodes while listening. There are options for skip buttons in the app itself, as well as for how other remote controls, such as on a headset or in a car system, will behave.
    The last setting has to do with information privacy. To help providers of podcasts and Apple improve what you hear, data is collected as you use the Podcasts app. There's a nice explanation of this that can be reached by double tapping the Privacy button. Next to this button is a setting that lets you reset your unique identifier number. This number isn't connected to your Apple account and is only used to identify the data as being from a single user.
Overcast:
This app is very popular and offers more advanced features than the Podcasts app from Apple. One of the features that sets this app apart is called "voice boost". It alters the sound of podcasts in a manner that makes spoken dialogue easier to hear. This could prove especially helpful for those with hearing difficulties or while you're in noisy environments but still need to understand what is said.
    Overcast is free from the app store, but is ad supported. A premium subscription can be paid for that gives additional features and keeps the ads away. Even without paying for this, Overcast is an excellent podcast player. Just be familiar enough with navigating around using VoiceOver, so the ads don't trip you up. It's not rocket science, and you get a far more flexible, powerful podcast player for your troubles. Overcast is updated frequently and kept in good working order.
    The design of Overcast will be especially appreciated by people who don't favour having everything in separate tabs. It's all in one place. Set the VoiceOver rotor to headings and quickly navigate between playlists, podcasts with fresh content, and older material already heard. Note the Settings button at the top left of the main screen. This app offers a wide array of useful settings that you should explore and change to suit your particular style and circumstances.
    To subscribe to a podcast using the Overcast app, do the following:
1. From the Settings button, flick right three times, and you will reach the Add Podcasts button. Alternatively, presuming your rotor is set to headings, flick down to the Playlists heading and then flick left once to reach the Add Podcasts button. Double tap this button.
2. From the top left, flick right until you come to an edit field labelled Search Directory. Double tap on this edit field and then type in what you want to search for. Example: "Kelly and Company". Double tap the Search button that appears on the bottom right to perform your search.
3. You will then be taken to a list of results your search term has found. Flick left or right to navigate this list, and double tap the show you want. This takes you into a show entry page. Flick right to find the Subscribe button and double tap this. You will now be subscribed to the show.
4. Make your way back by using the Back button found at the top left of the screen and, when possible, the Cancel button to move out of your search and back to the rest of the app.
Once you've subscribed to some podcasts, you'll want to play them. To do this:
1. If you want to hear the latest episodes, flick right until you get to the Episodes playlist. This is the first playlist under the Playlists heading and is easy to find even without using the rotor. Double tap on All Episodes. Should you wish to hear older played episodes, Flick down to the Podcasts heading and flick right until you come to the podcast you want. Double tap on this and then flick right to scroll through episodes.
2. You can then navigate the list of episodes by flicking right or left using a finger. Double tap on the episode you want to hear, and you will be presented with a range of options. The second option is the Play button. Double tap this and the episode will begin playing.
3. During playback, a special screen will appear with controls to help you enjoy and share what you're listening to. This includes a button for the "voice boost" feature, as well as other facilities like a sleep timer.
4. When done listening, double tap the Back button in the top-left corner. This returns you to the playlist or list of episodes you were in. This won't stop playback. You can explore, subscribe to podcasts, and do other things while still listening to an episode. Double tapping anywhere on the screen with two fingers allows easy pausing and resuming of playback, even while in other apps.
Downcast:
Until early 2020, Downcast was my absolute favourite podcast app. It costs $3.99 in the app store. You get everything for that low one-time fee. It is possible to make use of a tip jar in the app to voluntarily pay the developer, which encourages further development of the app. No ads to worry about. A rich set of features, including the ability to import podcast lists. Look in the More tab, and you'll find settings, tools, all sorts of help, and other options. You can import audio or video files and have them treated like a podcast. This can work well for audiobooks in MP3 format and other audio files. Go to the Add tab to search for and add podcasts. For the most part, I find things are explained quite well in context. Learning what options are available is straightforward.
    This app is a highly regarded podcast app fully accessible with VoiceOver that can be purchased from the app store. Downcast has remained a popular podcast app due to its robust set of features and avoidance of being supported by ads. Look in the More tab in the bottom-right corner of the screen. That tab contains settings and tools to enhance your enjoyment of podcasts. Take the time to explore.
    To subscribe to podcasts, do the following:
1. There are five tabs across the bottom of the screen. The Add tab is in the centre of the row. Double tap on it.
2. From the top left, flick right until you reach the Search for Podcasts button. It is immediately to the right of the Add Podcasts Manually button and above the Top Podcasts heading. Double tap the Search for Podcast button.
3. You will be placed in an edit field found at the top left of the screen. Type in the name of a show you want to subscribe to. For instance, "AMI Audio Live". Find the Search button that appears in the bottom-right corner.
4. You will then be placed in a list of results found by your search. Flick left or right to navigate these results. Double tap on the show you want.
5. This takes you to the show entry page. Near the top left of the screen, right after the show name, you'll find a Subscribe button. Double tap this to subscribe to the podcast. Once this has been done, double tap the Back button found in the top-left corner to move back out of the show entry and search results. This reveals the other tabs in the app, allowing you to subscribe to another show using the steps above or go to your list of subscribed podcasts.
Once you've added one or more podcasts, playing them is easy.
1. Upon first opening the app, you will be in the Podcasts tab. If you're elsewhere, the tab can be found in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Double tap this tab.
2. Note the Refresh button at the top left. Use it to make certain you have the latest episodes ready to stream or download.
3. Flick right through the list, which starts with podcasts containing unplayed episodes at the top. Flick left or right to navigate the list, and double tap on the podcast you want to hear.
4. You will now be in the list of available episodes, starting with the most recent. Flick left or right to navigate this list, and double tap on the episode you would like to hear. It will begin playing.
5. During playback, you will be on a screen containing controls to help you enjoy the podcast. Flick left or right to go through options, double tapping on what you want to do. The Back button at the top left will return you to the list of episodes.
The Castro App:
I found out about this wonder of a podcast player through listening to Internet radio. The Mosen At Large show on Mushroom FM to be precise. While the show is no longer broadcast, listeners eager for similar content might want to look in the list of podcasts below this section for more current offerings. On that show, Jonathan Mosen described how happy he was with this Castro app and what a difference it had made to his podcast listening. On his recommendation, I decided to give it a try. Until then, I was perfectly happy with Downcast and had doubts whether anybody would ever outdo that app.
    Castro is designed for busy people who, like me, want to subscribe to more podcasts than they have time to listen to. The app has three levels of organization. Each has its own separate tab. There are four tabs positioned slightly above a strip of play controls across the bottom of the screen. These are Queue, Inbox, Library, and Explore.
    The Queue tab is where the episodes you want to hear next are placed. It's the tab you start in when you open the app. You can start playing a podcast episode in the queue, sit back and listen. Subsequent episodes are played in the order they appear in the queue. You can rearrange episodes in the queue, clear episodes from the queue, or start an episode playing out of sequence whenever you wish. You may also add more episodes to the queue at its beginning, so they're up next, or at the end, so they're last in line. You can have episodes in the queue automatically downloaded to your device. Even better, settings within the app let you determine how many episodes or how many hours worth of material from the queue are downloaded to your device. This helps tremendously when you want to make certain you have fresh episodes but don't want to micromanage exactly which ones get downloaded.
    The Inbox tab is like your email inbox. New episodes appear in chronological order from all of the podcasts you subscribe to. They aren't downloaded or added to the queue unless you make this happen. You can flick through episodes in the Inbox tab and hear descriptions of them. Then, you can easily add only the episodes you wish to hear to the queue. Simply clear any you aren't interested in from the Inbox tab and await the next, hopefully more interesting, episode from that podcast.
    The Library tab is where you'll find all of the podcasts you currently subscribe to. You manage subscriptions here, removing any that you no longer want or changing the settings for each podcast to determine how new episodes are dealt with. Also, this is where you can explore and listen to older episodes you didn't have time to catch earlier or simply weren't interested in when they first appeared.
    Finally, the Explore tab is where you look for new podcasts to listen to. As with most podcast apps, you can browse popular podcast categories for new content or search via the search field for podcasts you know the titles, producers, people, or keywords for. There are plenty of facilities for exploration.
    Once you're playing an episode, there are alternative views to choose from. You can look at the show notes if they're available. Also, you can see podcast art or simply an expanded set of playback controls. There are some advanced options like speed control, silence removal, and an enhanced voice option that clarifies any spoken words in the podcast. This is similar to the voice boost feature found in Overcast.
    To help further organize your listening, Castro has added the ability to create folders. You can also look at what's in a folder, the queue, or other lists of podcasts or episodes in different ways. I find this more annoying than helpful and wish they had stuck to the original idea. If you ever find that you're not seeing the list of episodes you're expecting, check the line of tabs near the top of the screen. They are episodes, Shows, Categories, and Folders. I always prefer having the episodes tab selected. Simply double tap a tab to select it and your podcasts will be displayed accordingly.
    Castro is supported by subscription. This unlocks some advanced features, such as being able to sideload or import audio or video content. This is especially useful for YouTube videos, turning them into podcasts that are uninterrupted by those pesky ads. This is fabulous for listening to longer videos like game playthroughs at your own pace and being able to easily jump around in them. You could also sideload audiobooks in MP3 format or other files for playing at your convenience. Even if you don't plan to subscribe, anybody who appreciates podcasts should check this app out.
Further Thoughts on Podcasts and Podcast Apps:
As I update this section for the third edition in 2024, some trends are becoming more apparent. For one thing, podcast apps are struggling more to compete and differentiate themselves from one another. This has proved somewhat perilous to how accessible and practical to use the apps are. For a long stretch of time, Castro became very annoying to use. It reached a point when I abandoned it and returned to using Downcast. Castro is now back to being a delight to use, aside from the needless but thankfully optional extra organization and display filters. Sadly, the developers behind another old favourite app called Overcast have decided it needed to be redesigned. This has caused ongoing annoyance and accessibility issues. Such choices on the part of developers, especially when accessibility isn't considered before changes are pushed out, have caused waves of app switching and angry discussion. Typically, there's at least one good alternative to switch to. However, doing so is never without pain points. Matters aren't helped by Apple's choice to not allow you to export your followed podcasts from the app or import followed podcasts to the app. While Apple is slowly improving the Podcasts app, using it as your main app locks you in more than others. Also, you'll miss out on potentially useful features offered by third-party podcast apps. The only big advantage is that you're unlikely to suddenly find Apple's Podcasts app inaccessible using VoiceOver. Whatever you decide, make certain you have a backup app for podcast listening ready to go.
    The majority of podcasts are still free to follow, supported by advertising and sponsorships. However, there are an increasing number of podcasts which depend more on subscription payments for their funding. Most of these will offer an ad-supported free version. If the content is of enough interest to you, subscribing will provide you with access to extra content, remove ads, and possibly offer other benefits. This is one area where the Apple Podcasts app shines. It makes subscribing and managing such subscriptions very easy. Many podcasts have joined into channels or networks which lets you pay one subscription fee to unlock all of their extra content. This convenience comes at a cost to podcast creators who may pass on that cost to you. It may be cheaper to check for a website or alternative subscription method at the expense of that convenience.
    Audio entertainment is experiencing something of a revival these days. Podcasts were once a fringe hobby for geeks. Now, they're part of everyday conversation and listened to by all kinds of people. Radio shows often make their episodes available as podcasts, so people can listen wherever and whenever they wish. They're a wonderful tool for education. Many podcasts are put out by blindness organizations as a way of sharing news and knowledge. I'll put a number of such blindness-related podcasts in the Podcasts to Start With list found below. I hope people find these as helpful as I have over the years.
    The apps discussed above are fully accessible to VoiceOver users. There are many more options out there in the app store. Nothing says you can't have more than one podcast player. Just keep in mind that each of them might download any podcasts you subscribed to, unless you change the settings for the app so that it doesn't download anything automatically. I use Castro for my podcast listening needs and have set things so a certain amount of podcast episodes most likely to interest me are added to the queue and downloaded automatically. Thanks to Apple's new Podcast Plus service, I also now frequently make use of the Podcasts app which comes included in iOS. I have this app set not to download any content and simply have shows stream over Wi-Fi or cellular data when I want to listen to them. Find the app and style of managing content that best suits you. Each podcast player will have its own approach to things like displaying new podcasts, managing downloads, etc.
    All podcast player apps will have facilities for finding podcasts. In Downcast, go into the Add tab. There, you'll find the ability to search for a podcast you might know the name of. You will also find directories of popular podcasts that you can browse and then subscribe to any podcasts that interest you. Once you do that, you will be informed of any new episodes of that podcast. The apps will typically default to the behaviour of downloading the new episodes automatically. If you subscribe to many podcasts, this isn't such a good thing, as your device's storage could be completely filled with episodes. Most podcast players have settings to automatically delete older episodes, so your device doesn't get filled to the brim.
    There's so much good audio made available in podcast form that it boggles the brain. I'll never run out of new ones to try. Much like beer in that regard. There are only so many hours to listen in a day, though. I follow well over two hundred podcasts and will comb through new episodes when I want something interesting to hear. Other people simply subscribe to a low enough number of podcasts that they can listen to in order or make playlists to hear and keep up with them all. They're all free for the taking.
Podcasts to Start With:
Many organizations produce podcasts. In particular, if you enter "CNIB", "RNIB", "Accessible Media", "CCB", "CBC", "NPR", or "BBC" in your podcast player's search box, you'll find a wide range of podcasts. These range from podcasts about reading, technology, useful blindness information, and much, much more. I wish you the best of success in your search for great podcasts to listen to.
    To help you get started, I've listed some podcasts below that offer substantially good entertainment or else are beneficial to hear. Just type the name of the podcast into the search field of your podcast app of choice, and you should be able to subscribe and tune in. I've written a brief paragraph about each podcast. Other than being certain to include a wide range of podcasts, these are in no particular order. They've all simply proved to be very useful, enjoyable, or fascinating to me. I hope you find at least some of them to be worth your time. This is just the tip of the iceberg, but will hopefully give people a good starting place. As new episodes get released, your podcast player can keep you informed. Take the time to learn the options and settings available in the app you've chosen. The time spent pays off as your listening priorities and circumstances change. Some great podcasts to start with are:
    Access on:
    This is a gateway to current information of interest to blind people the world over who use technology. You'll find interviews, product demonstations and reviews, tech tips from listeners, and much more. It has a loyal community of listeners who have tuned into previous podcasts hosted by Jonathan Mosen. . Now sponsored by the National Federation of the Blind, this podcast carries on a wonderful legacy of quality and thoroughness. I've enjoyed the efforts of Jonathan Mosen, the producer and host of the podcast, for over two decades now. If you are keen to learn about what blind people are thinking about the technology which effects all of us, this is the podcast and community for you.
    Double Tap Canada:
    This podcast is available on YouTube or in your podcast player of choice. It is produced by two tech experts in the UK. Steven and Shaun, discuss all things tech and much more besides. They interview important people in the accessible tech industry, cover various conventions where new tech is shown, and interact with their large community of listeners. Much fun is had along the way.
    Unmute Presents:
    This podcast is backed by the American Counil of th Blind. It ofers tech help and discussion feturing a number of blind experts. There's a real tight focus on the community and helping everyone make the most of their accessible technology.
    The No Sleep Podcast:
    For fans of spooky short horror fiction done right, this podcast is a gift that keeps on giving. Introdced by the ghoulishly cheerful host David Comings, this ongoing anthology has consistently delivered top quality entertainment. Free episodes are over an hour long and present a number of stories. All are performed by paid actors and writers are paid to have their work featured. Sound and music are added to produce something truly excellent. Paid subscription unlocks a special feed with episodes over twice as long as the free ones. There are also special episodes at Christmas and Halloween.
    Now or Never:
    This is a wonderfully fun, hopeful, and inspiring show on CBC Radio that looks at people seeking to change their circumstances, habits, or character in a meaningful way. Hosts Ify Chiwetelu and Trevor Dineen interview people and often join them during critical moments as they move out of their comfort zones. I've consistently found this to be excellent and uplifting fun.
    Snap Judgement:
    Glynn Washington and crew provide thematically linked interesting stories, both real and fictional. They've kept the podcast going for around seven years, and there are hundreds of hours of well-produced and curated stories. They have some great special episodes, including "spook" specials around Halloween and other holiday specials. Shows have a theme that links the stories they contain.
    The Overnightscape:
    A favourite of mine, you just never know what Frank will get into. Frank Edward Nora records his thoughts on all sorts of pop culture and other aspects of life while travelling through New York or other places. Many things are described as he encounters them. He sometimes meets with friends and family who join in the adventure. At the end of episodes is a section called The Other Side, where you'll find independent music or publicly available sounds from the present and past. A most interesting listening experience. Be aware that this podcast is relatively long and usually spans around two hours per episode.
    The AppleVis Podcast:
    This branch of the AppleVis website and community offers audio demonstrations and tutorials produced by community members for blind users of Apple products. Stay up to date with this podcast, and you'll be well-informed about accessible apps and know how to get the most from your Apple gear. This can be very useful and motivating for beginners, who may find navigating websites and documents to be harder as they get used to VoiceOver.
    Blind Abilities:
    This podcast has a focus that goes beyond technology. All sorts of people have been interviewed, and a wide range of topics are covered that relate to blindness. There are very helpful tech tutorials such as the iPhone 101 series included in this podcast, so you're strongly advised to check through older episodes.
    Eyes On Success:
    Peter and Nancy Torpey have hosted over a thousand episodes of this blindness-related podcast. It features discussions with all sorts of blind people themselves or involved with things that matter to blind people. Guests have included volunteer book narrators, orientation and mobility instructors, and many more besides. I always try to keep current on what the latest episode is about.
    The Next Chapter:
    This is a radio show that has remained on the air for well over a decade. Host Shelagh Rogers has now retired, but new host have kept the show on the air. The discussion is all about books, interviewing authors and others about what they're reading and writing. It focusses on Canadian authors and does a tremendous service to readers wondering what authors to read next.
    Three Books:
    Neil Pasricha is a best-selling author of books like The Book of Awesome. He hosts a very interesting podcast. In it, he has discussions with various authors and experts about three books that have been important in their lives. The guests have been very wide-ranging, and their book choices are often surprising.
    Aaron Mahnke's Cabinet of Curiosities:
    This short but fascinating podcast deals with strange stories from history. Aaron is a historian and shares a seemingly endless supply of strange episodes, a few at a time. Podcasts tend to be around fifteen minutes. He also hosts a longer podcast called Lore that deals more with the supernatural. I've found both to be unfailingly entertaining.
    Haunted Places:
    If you're desiring a ghost story, this podcast has you covered. It features dramatizations of different supernatural events that have made places haunted. These episodes may not be suitable for young children. These stories are very well produced with good use of sound and narration.
    From Our Own Correspondent:
    This has been a long time favourite podcast from the BBC. Host Kate Adie presents a range of reports from writers and journalists living and working in different countries around the world. They all share some of their personal experiences going beyond the headlines. Having a glimpse of what life is like in places where news happens makes for an absolutely fascinating show. I've unfailingly enjoyed each episode I've managed to catch for well over ten years now.
    More with Anna Maria Tremonti:
    This former host of an outstanding CBC show called The Current now has her own podcast. Rather than news stories, this is about having long conversations with various famous people about all manner of subjects. I've keenly enjoyed hearing these discussions and hope that this show has some serious longevity.
    Voices of The Walrus:
    This podcast features content from the Walrus magazine. Stories tend to be deeper than average magazine articles. They are well researched and read. There are also interviews with the authors. Definitely worth adding to your podcast selections.
    TED Radio Hour:
    Perhaps, you've heard people mention TED Talks. These are typically short lectures that cover a vast range of topics, usually delivered by people who care deeply about a given topic. The letters in TED stand for Technology, Entertainment, and Design. In the TED Radio Hour, host Manoush Zomorodi introduces an hour's worth of these lectures that all have a theme or area of focus in common. A recent episode looks at loneliness as an example. If you like what you hear in this podcast, you should also be certain to grab the TED app, which makes it easy to explore the thousands of short lectures available from the TED Foundation.
    White Coat, Black Art:
    Health and medicine can make for interesting listening. Dr. Brian Goldman is an emergency room physician who has also become a writer and radio show host. In this podcast and radio show heard on CBC Radio, Dr. Goldman discusses various medical issues, bringing in all kinds of knowledgeable guests as well as patients. As a bonus, he now has a second podcast called The Dose that is more focused on issues surrounding the COVID-19 virus.

Reading Books on iOS Devices:
The day was a nice one in the summer of 2017 as I arrived at what I hoped was the correct Tim Hortons restaurant near Harbourfront in Toronto. It was where the CNIB had chosen for a meeting point so blind attendees of the Word on the Street festival could hook up with their volunteer guides for the day. I had made a point of calling Falguni, my volunteer guide, before this, so I had a good chance of recognizing her voice when we met. It took several texts back and forth to accomplish that, standing just outside the noisy and bustling place. I had never attended an outdoor book festival before on my own. The opportunity had never come up despite my long-standing love of books. When you lack independent, affordable transportation, there's an increasing tendency simply not to go out of your way to find out about what you have no practical way of participating in. That year, things were different. The CNIB wanted more blind people to attend the festival and had arranged for volunteers to help us enjoy what was on offer. Teaming up with festival organizers, they had put together a DAISY-formatted information book containing a schedule of events and descriptions of what would be happening. I was able to go through this material before attending and have it ready for use while I was there. They had also paid the cost of transportation for some of us, including me. I couldn't say no to that kind of opportunity.
    The occasion was unforgettably fascinating. I attended talks by several well-known authors. That year, I was able to hear Drew Hayden Taylor, live and in person, reading from his latest book: Take Us to Your Chief: and Other Stories - classic science fiction with a contemporary First Nations outlook.
    I had first heard him on a show called The Next Chapter. It runs to this day on CBC Radio and is also available as a podcast. My wife and I are regular listeners. He could have been yet another writer forever out of reach, but not that day. He did a wonderful job reading a very witty and amusing part of a story from his book. So good a job that I decided that a Kindle copy of it would make for a fine souvenir of this day. For less than the price of a dinner at a restaurant, sitting right there in his captivated audience, I purchased his book and downloaded it onto my iPhone.
    Apple's best public relations people couldn't have designed an event to better illustrate the liberation that was made possible for blind people thanks to an iPhone had they tried. While riding in an Uber car there and back, I could check where I was at any point. The same applied while I was there, had I somehow gotten separated from my volunteer. I was able to know what was happening and have agency over what we went to. I was also able to unobtrusively purchase an author's words in book form while he spoke on the stage. This is the kind of thing I could only dream about doing as a teenager. And then the pieces came together, and it happened for real.
    Since 2011, I've increasingly done the majority of my reading on my iPhone. It has become my portable book collection, storing thousands of fully accessible ebooks and hundreds of audiobooks. Recorded sound has always taken up far more storage than simple computer characters. Even so, I can easily carry whole days worth of audiobooks without breaking a proverbial sweat. My iPHONE has put to an end all the stacks of CDs and shelves of Braille volumes I would need to have even a basic collection of favourite accessible books at my disposal. Now, it all fits securely in my pocket or in one hand. Should I want to read something in Braille, I have a fourteen-cell Braille display, the same size and a bit heavier than a trade paperback book. Granted, those are expensive. I paid nearly $2000 Canadian for it, and it was far from the latest and greatest even then.
    For most of my life, the choice of what I could read and when I could read it depended on the efforts of libraries for the blind. By the time I got to read a bestseller, let alone something more obscure, it was often years after my sighted friends and family had read it and stopped thinking about it. If you were truly desperate to read a popular book while your friends were, you could pay five times as much as your friends paid for a paperback book to get an audio edition on CD. Beyond that, you either had to get an illegal copy which someone else had scanned in using optical character recognition, or else buy the book and spend hours scanning in the pages. This usually meant wrecking the book and potentially ending up with missing pages or pages out of order. Over the past decade, a great deal of change has taken place. Due to the rise in popularity of ebooks and audiobooks, those days are thankfully gone for good.
    Apps like Apple Books, Kindle, Audible, and Voice Dream Reader have thoroughly changed my reading world and options. They have been the keys that have at last liberated me from the prison of being in a situation where only a small fraction of what was published could be obtained in accessible form. The major ebook publishers, led first by Apple with its iBooks app, let blind people tap into commercial sources of books, paying the same as everyone else does for precisely the same books while they're still brand new to everybody. These books can be read on a Braille display, spoken using high-quality synthetic speech via the VoiceOver screen reader, or narrated by a professional human reader, depending on your choice of book provider and personal preference. No extra work need be done by charitable organizations to make this astounding advance possible. Instead, the work is done by the companies providing the books in ebook or digital audio formats. They invest in making certain their apps are accessible to VoiceOver, which allows the ebooks to be read out loud or translated into Braille and sends the result to a Braille display on the fly.
    Over time, conditions have gotten a lot better on other platforms, such as Windows and Android. Libraries for the blind were offering digital content that substantially broadened what they could make available. However, things really changed after I got my iPhone 4. Now, thanks to Apple, I could hear about a book that a friend had just read and buy a copy for myself before the conversation had completed.
    Twenty years ago, I walked the hallways of my school, weighed down by a backpack containing around forty pounds of Braille volumes containing what I hoped were the right fractions of my textbooks for the day's classes. People too close behind me when I turned a corner were apt to be crushed into a wall. I've gone from that experience to where we are today. It's now possible for blind people to own a vast library, far exceeding 1,000 accessible books, and carry it with them in a pocket. This has profoundly liberated me beyond my ability to adequately put into words. Now, the books I own and read are precisely the books I wish to. Although I still make occasional use of a digital library for the blind, the bulk of what I read are books I have purchased, paying the same price as any sighted reader would. Until around twelve years ago, this capability was simply unimaginable.
    Having attempted to write a collection of short stories twice now without success, I realize what hard work writing can be. As someone whose understanding of the world is primarily built on words and stories, I deeply value the efforts of authors. Over the past years, I've made it a personal mission to obtain legal and accessible copies of books that have meant something to me and those that interest me now. I have succeeded in purchasing all the titles I read and still wanted to own from my teenage years to the present day. Watching carefully for deals, bundles and sales, making use of gift money and earnings, I've built a personal library I couldn't have imagined having for most of my life.
    Below, I'll discuss the various sources of audio and ebooks that I make use of, as well as the apps needed to acquire and read books. Information access is absolutely vital to our success and growth as people. Not just facts, but thoughts, ideas, and stories also. For me, the iPhone has been the key to all of this. I hope I've included enough information below to help all of my readers expand their horizons in this key aspect of life.
Reading in the Walled Garden:
The Books App:
    Apple tends to favour convenience and simplicity. You see this in all of its stores and apps. Things are as well crafted and simple as possible from one end of the experience to the other. Using the Apple Books app, you can purchase and read books, including audiobooks, all from within the same app. The interface is very accessible and intuitive. There's no need to have mastered browsing the web or to register accounts with different book vendors. Everything is handled through your Apple account. For new users, this is especially compelling. Well over a million books are made available on Apple Books.
    Keep in mind, however, that publishing isn't Apple's core business. You may find that the book you want isn't available as an audio or ebook. This is especially true for books that are off the beaten path of bestsellers. Furthermore, other book vendors are far more aggressive with pricing and offering bargains. This makes a tremendous difference if you're buying books all the time. There are free books as well as ones you pay for. Like other ebook publishers, there are special sales and offers. However, obtaining a large library of ebooks and audiobooks using the Books app exclusively will cost you more than it would on Amazon Kindle or other venues. You can get audiobooks as well, but they can be gotten more cheaply elsewhere, presuming patience and discipline. Once we've examined Apple Books, the rest of this major guide section is a deep exploration of alternative sources for acquiring and reading books on your iOS device. Knowing your options up front will hopefully allow people to make the best informed choice for their abilities and circumstances. With that said, let's dive right into an overview and exploration of the Books app.
    Near the top left part of the screen, you will always find one or more buttons that perform actions or let you access special parts of the app. This is where you'll find any such buttons, so you never need to look near the tabs at the bottom for options. It's a nice bit of consistency with other apps made by Apple that offer digital goods. Such consistency helps make this app a wonderful starting point for reading on iOS devices. As you explore, always explore the area directly below the status bar near the left of the screen for likely options.
    There are five tabs across the bottom of the screen that, when double tapped, expose different areas of activity. The Home tab is on the far left. Going to the right across the bottom, you'll find the Library, Book Store, Audiobooks, and Search tabs. The Home tab focuses in on what you're currently reading and what you might want to read. The Library tab contains all content you've chosen to add, including books, audiobooks, PDF documents, etc. The Book Store tab is where you shop for ebooks that you can read using VoiceOver. The Audiobooks tab is similar to the Book Store but provides access to audiobooks narrated by human beings as well as some audio dramas and shows. Finally, the Search tab is where you can directly seek books whose name or author you already know. Now that you have an overview, take some time to explore the app on your own. Many of you will be able to master this without much more information. However, to make the best use of this app, let's examine each tab in greater detail.
The Home Tab:
This tab focusses on what you're currently reading and have shown interest in reading. It contains the most recent books you've looked at under a heading called "Continue" near the very top of the screen. There are more headings below this including "Top Picks":, "Want to Read", "Books you might like", etc. Simply turn the rotor to headings and flick up or down to get to them.
    The "Want to Read" heading contains a list of books you've marked as wanting to read. It's the equivalent of a wish list in other online stores. These can be ones you already own or not. Think of it as a combination wish list and a "to read" list.
The Library Tab:
This tab is where your personal repository can be found. All the books you have purchased or chosen to get if they're free are available here. They're sortable and will automatically be added to a series if they're part of one. Finding what you're after among your collection is painless and speedy. There's an Edit button in the top-left area, as well as the Sort and Collections button. These let you manage your stash of books and documents as it grows. The total numbers of each kind of document stored in the Books app is displayed. You can also create your own collections of books or decide how the books are sorted within the library. If space is tight, you can remove books from your device, and they'll still show in your library as being in the iCloud. Double tapping on a book in the iCloud will download it to your device.
    Because both your Library and the Book Store are combined in one app, it is easy to get an overview of a series of books, discovering what you already own and still may wish to obtain. For instance, I have several of the books written by the people who give the Massey Lectures as heard on CBC Radio each year. They are all part of the Massey Lectures series of books. From the Library tab, I can double tap on the Massey Lectures series. Once inside, I can choose via buttons near the top to either look at the books I already own or the complete series. If I find a book I'm interested in, I can simply double tap on its price and acquire it immediately. If I had collected this series from Amazon Kindle, I would need to go to the website and browse to where the series is shown. Amazon doesn't let you accidentally purchase a book you already own, so there's no danger there. However, it is a far more rapid and convenient process to quickly determine what you do and don't own using the Books app. That's one of its strengths.
The Book Store Tab:
This tab is where you'll want to go when you're curious to see what's new, popular, and available. The Book Store is always customized for your selected region and will only show you material that is actually available to you. It is a very full screen with many sections and books on immediate display. Don't forget that there's always far more available than can ever be shown on one screen. Don't ever give up if what you hope to find isn't immediately obvious.
    At the very top, below the status bar, you'll find a Browse Sections button. This lets you specify and gain access to an area focusing on a particular genre or other category of interest. Double tap this button and then flick right through the list of possible choices. Double tap on the section of the store that you want to go to, and you'll be taken there. Throughout the Book Store, don't ever worry about getting stuck in a section or book description. Simply feel around the top-left corner below the status bar, and you'll find a Back button. This will take you one level back from where you've gotten to, and you'll find more options. You'll always be able to return to the initial screen of the tab you're in.
    Throughout all of Apple's ecosystem, headings play an important part of how busy screens displaying many offerings are divided up. Turn your rotor setting to Headings, and you'll be able to get around a lot easier. To quickly navigate these main storefront screens, flick up or down to move between headings. Once you've reached a heading, flick right to go through the contents found beneath it. Double tap on anything that interests you to be taken to the item's entry. To be certain of catching everything, I sometimes go to the next heading below the one I'm interested in and then flick left over the entries. This is a good practice, since some areas need to be scrolled down through to see everything in them.
    These main storefront screens are something I very much appreciate. I tend to get absorbed in my own areas of special interest. These featured collections, top charts, and sections on what's new and trending give me at least a minimal exposure to what's happening in other literary corners.
    To purchase a book, double tap on the title to enter the book's space. While this step isn't strictly necessary in all cases, it makes certain that you end up with what you intend to get. Flick through the information until you come to the price or Get button if the book is free. Double tap on that and then complete the purchase like you would any other in the Apple ecosystem. The book will then be added to your library and will be available to read.
The Audiobooks Tab:
Nearly identical in structure to the Book Store tab, the Audiobooks tab has similar headings and sections, allowing you to see what's trending, focus on various interests, etc. Both sections feature top charts for paid and free books, with top entries followed by See All buttons to expand and focus on that particular chart or group of books. There are many buttons that will take you to separate areas. In similar fashion, you can browse through various sections and genres of books depending on your interests.
    At the time of this second edition's publication in 2022, there have been consistent rumours that Apple may be close to launching its own separate audiobook production service. Currently, the audiobooks you purchase using the Books app are produced by Audible, the leading competitor in the digital audiobooks market. This move would be consistent with Apple's other moves to create their own music, streaming, and book publishing services. If anybody could shake up the current state of things in the world of audiobooks, it would be Apple. For users of the Books app, I doubt that much would change in terms of how you obtained and listened to audio content. The controls and categories might change a little, but I don't anticipate any change drastic enough to render this part of the guide obsolete overnight. More available content would simply be produced by Apple and might be less expensive. As of early 2025, nothing along these lines has actually happened. Every narrator of an audiobook seems to be the same as is found on Audible. Time will tell.
The Search Tab:
This is where you can search for something you know the author or name of. It's a basic search field until you actually enter keywords, author, title, etc. Once you've done that and hit the Search button that appears in the bottom-right corner, you'll find the results neatly divided by headings. These include In Your Library at the top of the stack, Book Store below those results, and Audiobooks at the bottom of the stack. Go to the heading of interest and then flick right to see what's there. Double tap on what you want. Just keep in mind that there may be more results than can fit on a single screen. To check for that, I go to the next heading down and then flick left, which catches any results that might have been hidden.
    All of this is simple, presuming you have the rotor and typing on the onscreen keyboard mastered. If not, you can flick through all the results. Instead of entering and typing anything in the search field, flick right, and you'll discover a list of trending searches in the form of buttons. Double tapping on these will execute the appropriate search as if you had typed it into the field at the top left. It's always good to be able to know what others are looking into.
    When you find the title of a book that interests you, double tap on it. This puts you in the book's entry in the store. Think of it like picking up a book and looking exclusively at it. The book entry will have a description and other information about the book. There will be reviews, ratings, and lots more. If you want, you can add the book to your "want to read" list. You'll always find a button labelled "add to want to read" near the top left of the screen of a book's store entry. To obtain a book, find, and double tap the Get button or the price of the book if the book isn't free. The price will be a button just like the Get button. Follow the rest of the purchase procedure to acquire the book. It will then be downloaded into your library.
Reading Apple Books
After double tapping on a book title, you are placed inside the book. The Library button found in the top left will take you out of the book and back to your library. While in book-reading mode, the action area at the top left of the screen below the status bar has buttons to take you back to page 1 or close the book. Near the bottom right of the screen, you'll find a "menu" button in the very bottom-right corner. Flicking left of that, you'll encounter a button letting you lock or unlock the orientation of your iPhone so it stays in the current landscape or portrait mode. Left of that, you'll find a slider control which indicates your current page and lets you turn pages by flicking up or down.
    Double tapping on the menu button will allow you to access some settings which change the layout and appearance of the book. The very first item in the menu is a button showing your current position and giving you access to the table of contents. . Double tap this in order to browse through the sections, flicking right to scroll through them in order. Double tap on the section of the book that interests you. Had you kept flicking right past the Table of Contents button, you would come to the "Search book" and "Settings and Themes" buttons. There are also buttons letting you share information about the book, and activate visual aids like line guides. There's also a bookmark option. This lets you set a bookmark at your current position by having this set to on. There's no limit on the number of bookmarks you can have.
     Doing things like adjusting font size, theme, layout, etc, may-effect how VoiceOver proceeds through a book. The scrolling view performs well for continuous reading, but every once in a while, you'll hear a chunk of text repeat itself before you proceed to the next part of the document. The page view sometimes skips over text while reading continuously. You'll suddenly hear a sentence that doesn't quite fit with what came before, and you'll have to stop and move slightly backwards so as not to miss something. These things happen less frequently than they did when the first edition of this guide was written. Publishers have pretty wide latitude in how they format books, and this may be partly responsible for such problems with content. You might also find that some books simply can't be read with VoiceOver due to being too visual in nature. Comics and graphic novels are obvious candidates for this.
    The Search button lets you search for keywords to quickly find areas of particular interest. Once you've selected a section, double tap on its link to be taken to it.
    To reach the text of your book, go to the top left of the screen after opening the book and flick right. It's possible that you'll land on the cover or an image. In this case, you may have to scroll dow by flicking up with three fingers to move beyond this. You may have to slide your finger near the top of the screen to find where the text begins.
    Once you're on text, flicking left or right with one finger will read the next or previous paragraph. Using two fingers slightly spaced apart, flick them downward together on the screen to start your book reading continuously. Double tap anywhere on the screen to pause or resume continuous reading. Using the rotor, you can also read by character, word, line, etc. This can be useful to determine how things are spelled. While anywhere in the text, flicking down with one finger will let you access a few options. These let you hide or reveal the controls, like the menu. Another option lets you add a bookmark without needing to go into the menu. You can also jump to any notes, headings, or links. You can create notes by turning the rotor to Edit and flicking down to the option. Furthermore, you can also search for words or look up words once you've used the Text Selection rotor setting to highlight them. Swiping left or right with three fingers will move to the previous and next pages. Books can have pictures and illustrations that aren't always described. Patience and exploring the screen and various options can really pay off.
    Sadly, not all Apple books are accessible. Some are simply too graphical to be read by VoiceOver. If you end up with one of these, as has happened to me many times, simply find the receipt in your email that is sent after you make a purchase. You can then report problems with the book and ask for a refund. You'll need your Apple account and password to do this. Apple has been very understanding and quick to respond in all such instances that I have needed to do this.
    By definition, all audiobooks will be accessible. Should you encounter difficulties, you can follow similar procedures for reporting issues and obtaining refunds if you come across one that's utterly unworkable. Once you open an audiobook, You will find a series of very intuitive controls to skip forward and backward, play and pause, set a sleep timer, and switch the audio to any speakers or AirPods you might want to. The Table of Contents button is present here as well, and you can instantly switch between all tracks included in the book. You can also adjust the speed of narration.
Kindle Books:
I was absolutely overjoyed when word reached me in 2013 that Amazon had decided to make its Kindle app accessible using VoiceOver. There had been a way to read these books on Windows PCs, but it was annoying and poorly implemented. Thankfully, the iOS app received some real loving attention from someone who understood what was needed to make it not only workable but a downright attractive means of reading books. All at once, over a million books, including all the popular bestsellers, were rendered completely accessible and enjoyable. What's more, even the books that were far from bestsellers on topics like game design were now within my reach. Any Windows users should be aware that the Kindle app for Windows now works well with screen readers such as JAWS and NVDA.
    The main business of Amazon is selling products made by others. It was selling ebooks long before Apple came up with Apple Books. The books are read using VoiceOver, which means you can use any of the voices available to the screen reader. This includes extremely high-quality voices like Alex, any of the Siri voices, and other well-known options. Prices of Kindle books are equal to or lower than Apple Books prices. There are many more book sales and special bargains on the Kindle bookstore than on Apple Books. Because VoiceOver is used for reading Kindle books, people who have Braille displays can use them to read any Kindle books in Braille translated on the fly into the format of their choice. Amazon also owns Audible. A feature called "Whisper-sync" lets you buy the Audible book at a reduced price and then keeps track of your position in both the audio and ebook copies. Blind users can then switch at will between hearing a human narrate a book to reading it themselves in Braille. We've never had that flexibility before.
    Kindle books are quite small files. As of April 2025, I have around 4000 Kindle books, and they take up just under 28 GB of space. Keep in mind that there are many books in this collection which are complete works of authors or complete series of several books combined into one ebook. It's a stupendous amount of information to have in one's pocket. I find that Kindle books are the best option for anything I want to use as a reference rather than simply enjoy sequentially. Sometimes, I'll get both Kindle and Audible copies of a book I like so that I can always have it with me. Human narration can be absolutely spellbinding when done well. Audible does a good job of compressing books, but they're still much larger files. Many times, I've had to trim the Audible books I keep onboard my iPhone in order to reclaim space for other things. Not so for Kindle books. Individually, they don't often take up very much space at all. I can regain gigabytes of space by eliminating ten or twenty large Audible books from my storage, but would have to remove hundreds of Kindle books to regain the same amount of space.
    Sadly, the Kindle app has been designed with the thought that people will download their library of books as needed. This is perfectly workable. You take up far less storage space on your iPhone and the app opens much more quickly. I recommend this approach for most people. However, I'm not most people. I want my books to be there even when I'm totally disconnected from the Internet. Therefore, each time I upgrade to a new iPhone, one of the things I need to do is download all of my books, one by one, onto my iPhone. That can take days of one or two hour cessions downloading one book after another while listening to music, podcasts, or an audiobook. This process does make me more conscious of what I have, but I wish there was a simple way of starting a download of all books and having this happen in the background.
The Amazon Website:
You need to use the Amazon website to obtain Kindle books. Be certain to register with the correct Amazon site for your location. For Canadians, amazon.ca and for Americans, amazon.com. Your country is likely to have its own Amazon site, with a country appropriate domain name at the end of the web address. Some books are only offered in certain countries. Also, book deals and special offers differ from country to country.
    First, register an account with Amazon on the appropriate site. Next, get the Kindle app from the app store on your iOS device. You can then open the app and will be presented with an option to register your device with the account you created on the website. Once that process is done, the Kindle app will be registered to your Amazon account. You will then be ready to acquire and read Kindle books.
    You can use your computer as well as your iOS device. The NVDA screen reader, as well as other popular screen-readers like Jaws for Windows, support reading Kindle books on the PC.
    Recent changes to app store rules have allowed Amazon to make it easier to purchase books you find while using the app rather than the website. Once you've double tapped on a book title, flick right through the description, and you'll find a "get book" button. This will take you directly to the book on the website, eliminating the need to search for the book on the site. However, you will still be making the actual purchase via the website rather than in the Kindle app itself.
    The layout of the Amazon website will differ, since there is a special mobile version that will be used on your iOS device, or you can request the full desktop site be used. There are advantages either way. The mobile site is far less cluttered. This makes purchasing books as easy as it can possibly be. However, if you want to return books, I find that using the full site becomes necessary.
    Once you're logged in, find the Shop by Department link. This brings up a menu of links leading to different departments on Amazon. Go to the Kindle Store. Once there, flick right, and you'll flick across links that lead to Kindle Devices and will come to Kindle Books. Activate that link to go to the entrance page to the Kindle Books area. Now, any searches you do with the search facilities on the site will be focused on Kindle books.
    You'll find headings highlighting various featured books and links to different sections and categories of the bookstore. If you find a book you want to buy or obtain as a "free" book, double tap on the title to go to the book's entry on the site. Once there, you can read the book description, reviews, and other information. You can also buy the book. Free books require the same process as ones that cost money. You simply won't be charged. Search for a classic book like Treasure Island to try obtaining a book. Many classic books are free, and so are some modern ones. I haven't found a way to limit searches to free books or any way to browse all free books on the site. There are doubtless thousands.
    One recent addition to Kindle is the Kindle Unlimited library. For a monthly subscription, you can effectively borrow many ebooks for as long as you continue to pay the subscription. Not all books are offered through the Kindle Unlimited service. If you reach the limit of books you can borrow at once, just return ones you're finished with, and you can obtain more. These books can be downloaded like ordinary purchased Kindle books and be read offline. It is also possible to borrow these books from within the Kindle app and not need to go through the website unless you want to purchase a book to keep.
    Be sure to sign up for the Kindle Daily Deal newsletter. Also, each month, look through the Kindle monthly deals. You can get great books for very low prices. I've bought many great books by adding them to my wish list and waiting until they went on sale. You can sort your wish list by using the List Actions link. Hitting that brings up options that you flick right through. Sorting is one of them, and you can sort by price from low to high.
    There's never a rush. Take your time and really explore the Amazon site. It pays off.
The Kindle App:
Kindle takes a different approach to its interface than the Apple Books app. This approach has changed a lot since I first wrote about it in this guide. When you open the Kindle app under normal circumstances, you will be in the Home tab. I need to give this qualifier because things may be different if you haven't registered the app yet. Before acquiring any books, you'll have to create an amazon account and register the app with that account so that books are delivered to it. Things have markedly improved for the Kindle app since the last edition of this book. For one thing, the Home tab is far more useful and nicely laid out. The sections all have headings. If you want to see more of a category, you're likely to find a "see more from" button just before the next heading. These let you drill deeper into areas of interest.
    The many sections of this home tab include From Your Library, Most Wished for Books, Recommended for You, etc. While you can't purchase books using the app, you can borrow books if you're an Amazon subscriber using the Books Unlimited subscription. Amazon Prime subscribers get this as one of many perks. If you want to own books, you need to purchase them on the Amazon website appropriate to your country.
    There are four tabs across the bottom. At the very left is a tab that will contain the title of whatever your most recently read book is. Double tap on it to open the book to where you last were. To the right of that is the "Home" tab discussed above. Next over is the "Library" tab. Any books you have purchased or borrowed will be accessible from here. Finally, over on the far right, there's the More tab. This is where you'll find many important buttons. These include a couple of buttons related to the "Goodreads" community. Think of that as a kind of social platform for book lovers. You can read about what others are reading and contribute reviews of books you like. One button lets you manage your Goodreads profile, and the other lets you access the Goodreads community from within the Kindle app.
    This community was around long before Amazon acquired it. If you prefer, you can also access Goodreads from the website or use the actual Goodreads app that is free from the app store. This is what I typically do. By integrating your Goodreads account with your Kindle account, it becomes easier to keep Goodreads updated with what you're reading in the Kindle app.
    Other buttons in the More tab include a Sync button. This lets you make certain that all devices you might choose to read a Kindle book on know where you are in any book in your collection. It also makes certain that the libraries on all your devices are up-to-date. You will also find Help and Settings buttons. The help offered from within the app is pretty useful, but doesn't offer much when it comes to using the app with VoiceOver specifically. However, it does explain a lot about features in the app as well as about reading Kindle books. The Settings button includes areas where you register and update your account settings. You can also do things like change the font and spacing of books. It's worth going through those settings to see if any make your reading life easier.
    Most of the screen is used to display your collection of books or the book you're reading. At the top of the main library screen, there are several buttons, as well as a search field. The Notifications button in the top-left corner lets you access a notifications area containing anything Amazon might want to inform you of. Double tap the button to access those, and double tap the Done button when you are finished managing and reading the notifications. Past the search field, you'll find a Filter button, letting you focus on parts of your book collection. Next to that are All and Downloaded buttons. The Downloaded button switches the library view to only show books you've downloaded onto your device. The All button shows books in the Cloud as well as those on your device. The Filter button lets you show either books or personal documents you've sent to your Kindle cloud, or both books and personal documents. Past that filter button, you'll find one called View and Sort. This lets you sort the contents of your library in several ways, including by most recently viewed, author, title, or publication date. Double tap on a book title to enter the book.
Reading Books in the Kindle App:
The first time you open a book, you'll be presented with information about it. You can go through this or close it. At that point, the whole screen is taken up with the book itself. Swiping down with two fingers starts continuous reading. Double tapping anywhere on the screen will bring up a menu of options. One of these is Exit, which returns you to the book you're reading. The next is Close Book. This closes the book and returns you to the library or whichever tab you might have been in before reading. You get to options in the menu by flicking left or right. Double tap on what you want to access. One of the first options you find is Navigation Drawer. Sometimes, it is also called "table of contents". I believe this might depend on the book you're in, since I regularly encounter both option titles while reading books in my collection. This is a kind of submenu that opens when you double tap it. I use the Navigation Drawer frequently, since it's how you quickly reach part of a book. There are options for each chapter or part of a book. You'll also find other options dealing with getting around inside a book. Flick left or right through the options and double tap what you want to do.
    While reading, you can use a three-finger swipe left and right to turn pages. Use a one finger flick left or right to read the previous or next paragraph. You can also use the rotor and all normal VoiceOver controls to read by character, word, line, etc. A two finger flick downward will start continuous reading. The One finger triple tap gesture has superseded the older double tap and hold gesture. Both gestures bring up a menu of yet more options to highlight things in a book, create notes in a digital notebook, look up definitions, share, and copy passages of text, and more. Great for study notes.
    The app packs many options into the menu. If VoiceOver Hints are enabled, you'll get enough instructions to get you going. Exploration is rewarded. For example, the "X-Ray" option available in many books presents you with information about characters, people, and other important things like terms and concepts in books. Better than Cole's Notes, but it's not available for all books. Another hidden gem is "popular highlights", which shows what others have taken the time to share as being particularly notable. You'll also find it possible to look up word definitions from within the app. Amazon has been improving the Kindle experience for a long time. Far longer than iPhones existed. The result is a nicely polished, largely stable app that rewards exploration.
Other Sources of Ebooks:
There are many smaller online stores and ebook publishers. This gives independent and new authors a lot more capability to sell their works. It also allows for different methods of funding and different selling arrangements. This makes books from independent authors and books on less popular topics accessible to blind people. I have many books on game creation and design that I've obtained from different sources of ebooks. I paid no more for these accessible books than any sighted customer would. It's exceedingly unlikely that any of these books would turn up in the CELA Library, BARD, or other accessible libraries.
    Keep in mind that these ebook providers don't have the same kind of resources as Amazon or Apple Books. They are often very small businesses or even individual people with the skill to set up and run an online site. Depending on their skill and awareness of accessibility issues, their websites may be completely unique or tricky to use. Also, books may be less navigable due to the lack of proper accessibility tags in the files. This won't matter as much for pleasure reading, but would make referencing and study more difficult. People should be very comfortable with browsing the web if they want to take advantage of these different sources for books. The rotor is very useful getting to headings, links, buttons, and other elements. I also recommend they obtain the Voice Dream Reader app from the app store. While not strictly necessary, it can make certain that you'll be able to navigate your purchased ebooks with relative ease and choose from a wide range of voices for reading. Changing economics have forced this app to become one which requires a subscription for users who didn't previously have the app before the change happened. There are various monthly and yearly options which may or may not allow sharing with other family members. To find out more, please visit:
    https://www.voicedream.com
    When downloading ebooks using Safari, Once you click on a download link for a book, flick right, and you come to "Open In" options. There is also a More button that lets you import the file into the app you want to use to read the file. You need not stick with the default options. The Voice Dream Reader app is great for dealing with ePUB, PDF and other formats provided there is no digital rights management or DRM protection. Kindle books usually have DRM and cannot be read outside of their own special app. However, these alternative sources of books don't use proprietary formats, making for more options for reading.
    Payment is easier if you have a credit card. Many places accept PayPal, which can work directly from your bank account if you set that up. This is useful for people who don't have credit cards. Apple Pay is now widely available and goes through your Apple account. It makes for an easy way to pay for online purchases. It can be used on Kickstarter. As with PayPal, you can add a bank card and use it rather than a credit card.
Story Cartel
www.storycartel.com
    Story Cartel offers free Kindle or PDF copies of books in exchange for your honest reviews of them. These reviews can be published on Amazon, Goodreads, or your own blog if you have one. The purpose is to form relationships between readers and authors. Remember that you have around a month after obtaining a book to post a review, and give the link to that review to Story Cartel by completing the form related to the chosen book. You won't be able to obtain more books until you provide links to your reviews.
Kickstarter and Indiegogo:
www.kickstarter.com
    www.indiegogo.com
    Kickstarter and Indiegogo are often used to fund books that may be of interest. For example, roleplaying gamebooks are frequently funded through Kickstarter and released as PDF or ePUB files. These can be read using apps like Apple Books or Voice Dream Reader. Many labours of love are crowd funded through these sites. For instance, a couple of books titled You Are The Hero were crowd funded and written by Jonathan Green, a very knowledgeable author of Fighting Fantasy books. These books examined the history of this very popular series of adventure gamebooks. I have also obtained many books about the famous fictional crime fighting detective Sherlock Holmes. Written by modern writers or by scholars of Sherlock, they have been accumulating on my iPHONE as I, along with hundreds of other backers, have helped to fund their creation.
    Another area of special interest which Kickstarter has helped to unlock is that of digital roleplaying game books, including core rules, sourcebooks, and adventures. Many game creators have chosen to fund their creations through Kickstarter. This makes it possible to contact these authors during the campaign and as the books are created. I have advocated for accessibility to be considered and have found authors to be eager to expand their audience by following good accessibility practices.
CRC Press:
www.crcpress.com
    This is a great place to get textbooks. Books sold as ebooks use the VitalSource Bookshelf app and are in a proprietary format. You need to use the VitalSource Bookshelf app to read these books. The Windows PC app is also very accessible. Both are designed to work with screen readers. People looking for any sort of academic book should check this site out before giving up hope. They even go to the trouble of describing pictures and more visual items. Since accessibility is part of their overall process and development system, you can rest assured that if a book is in their catalog, it will be accessible if at all possible.
Bundle of Holding:
www.bundleofholding.com
    This is a great resource for people interested in roleplaying games, game design, and creating believable fictional worlds. Books are offered in bundles, reducing the cost and typically contributing to charities at the same time. Bundles have basic and bonus content depending on how much you decide to spend. Typically, books are in PDF or Epub format, which can be handled by many apps. I recommend Voice Dream Reader, but you can also use the Books app from Apple if you prefer.
DriveThruFiction:
www.drivethrufiction.com
    This site offers a wide range of lesser-known books including mysteries, romance, fantasy, horror, and science fiction, among other genres. Books are offered in PDF and other popular formats. They are watermarked to identify you as the purchaser. Annoying to hear read out loud on each page, but makes it easy to move by pages by searching for your own name.
StoryBundle:
www.storybundle.com
    This is a favourite source of books for me. Books are sold in themed bundles. These are written by indie authors and are curated by people including authors who have a strong knowledge and interest in the genre or theme of the bundle. Bundles have a basic collection as well as a bonus tier that can be unlocked by paying more than a minimum amount, which increases as more people purchase the bundle. Books are free from DRM of any kind, relying on the honesty of customers not to share books they've purchased. They are in PDF, ePUB and Kindle formats, so there's certain to be one you can use with your favourite reading app. Once you've created an account with StoryBundle, you can always download bundles you've purchased previously. A link to your personal download page is sent via email when you purchase a bundle. Usually, there's one bundle being featured on the site. If you click on the covers of books that interest you, a dialogue pops up, letting you read about the book whose cover you double tapped. Finding the Close button requires feeling around on the screen. I often turn to Google to find out about books within a bundle, but the dialogues are fully readable using Safari and VoiceOver. Patience and exploration are rewarded here. There's an edit field where you can put in the amount you want to pay. The amount automatically in there is just a suggestion. Look at the bundle to see what the current minimum needed to unlock the bonus is. As long as you're a cent above that, you'll get all the bonus books. It changes as time passes.
The ElevenReader App:
Eleven Labs is a company specializing in using artificial intelligence to create realistic voices. Interest in their activities markedly increased among blind people when they released the ElevenReader app. Free to use, this app can read any PDF, EPUB, and numerous other kinds of documents aloud in high-quality voices which remain unavailable in other apps. They have partnered with the estates of famous people to make their voices, as constructed by artificial intelligence, available. I was delighted to be able to hear part of my book read in the voices of Sir Lawrence Olivier and Bert Reynolds.
    This app has been made accessible using VoiceOver, but was designed for the general public. While it's perfectly possible to navigate documents, the primary idea was for people to listen to documents as they went about their commutes and did other things. You won't find the same navigation choices as you would in other apps designed with document accessibility for blind people as their primary focus. However, for people interested in reading for pleasure, this is perfectly adequate. The available voices are quite lifelike. According to Eleven Labs, they are the most contextually aware AI voices available.
    This app requires you to create an account with Eleven Labs and will guide you through this process when you first open the app. Once you have completed the onboarding process, you will be on the home screen. Across the top, there are a series of buttons including Home, Library, Import, Explore and Voices. These buttons will always be present, regardless of which screen you're on. The home screen contains buttons which let you manage your account, return quickly to recently read documents, and learn about any new developments with the app.
    The library screen is where you can access all of your documents. There are options to help you search through and sort them. You can also archive them. If you want to remove a document from the library, you must go into the document and double tap on "read options". One of the options available in the popup menu which appears is "delete document". Double tap on a document to open it so it can be read.
    The Import screen lets you add documents to your library. You can add documents from the clipboard, scan a print document, import document from your iCloud drive or other locations, write text to be spoken aloud, etc. It is also possible to turn documents into a podcast hosted by AI voices.
    The Explore screen is for finding interesting material for reading. Many articles and documents which are publicly available will be available for reading and adding to your library. Check this screen often for fresh content.
    The Voices button lets you explore different voices you might want to use. If you like a voice you find, you can add it to your collection. Voices added to your collection will be saved to your iPhone. To remove voices from your iPhone, double tap on the voice name and flick right to where it says "saved". Double tap on this and the voice will be removed. You can always get a voice back onto your iPhone if you change your mind later.
    When you have a document open for reading, there are buttons to seek forward and backward, play/pause, etc. At the top left is a "go back" button which closes the document and returns you to the library.
Voice Dream Reader:
Voice Dream Reader is an app that makes reading different kinds of documents simple and accessible. It can handle ebooks in PDF and EPUB formats, provided they aren't protected by digital rights management or DRM.
    It can't read Kindle or Apple Books, since these ebooks are protected by DRM. Many government forms and other documents are available online in PDF format, which Voice Dream Reader can handle. While reading forms is possible, filling them out isn't. While basic text editing is possible, consider Voice Dream Reader to be a reading tool. It can handle zipped audiobooks, including MP3 files and DAISY format books like those from the CELA Library.
    A real strength of this app is that you can treat documents like music, literally playing them in the background. This lets you use your EarPod controls to play a book while on a bus without having to have your iOS device out of pack or pocket. It can work with the screen locked, just like you can play music with the screen locked using your headset or earbud controls. For greater control, you need to unlock the screen and have your device handy. The app is designed to help more than just blind people. There are ways to change how documents are displayed so that reading is easier for visually impaired people and people with other reading difficulties. These are found by double tapping the Visual Settings button. This button is only revealed once a document has been opened for reading. Similarly, the Audio Settings button lets people customize how documents sound. Different synthetic voices can be acquired and managed. Speed, pitch, and volume can be set. This app makes extensive use of popup menus. Clutter is kept to a minimum. For instance, the Add button at the top left of the library reveals a popup menu of the many ways to add documents to your library. The same holds true for Settings, Sorting Options, and more.
The Library:
Whenever you open the app, you arrive at your library of documents available on your device. This library can be backed up to iCloud and stored and synced on iCloud Drive and other devices where you have installed Voice Dream Reader. At the top left is the Add button. This lets you add documents from different possible sources, such as Dropbox, etc.
    Filter is to the right of Add. You can organize documents into groups, view only documents from a certain source, or look at only flagged or unread documents. For a large collection of documents, creating folders is best. That's done in the By Folder button in the Filter popup. After hitting that, you'll find options to add folders and edit their order or names. You cannot create folders from the initial library screen.
    Edit is found to the right of Filter and lets you reorder, move, flag, or delete documents. Double tapping on a document selects it. This lets you select and move or do other things to many documents.
    Search is found to the right of Edit. This lets you search for documents within whatever filter you're currently in. If you haven't created any folders or selected a certain group of documents, this would search the names of all files in your collection, displaying those whose names contained what you typed in the search field.
    After the search field, you reach the start of your collection of documents or what is within, depending on the filters you selected. This can be flicked through or scrolled through with three-finger upward or downward swipes. Very useful with large collections containing many rows of documents.
    The bottom right of the screen contains further options, including:
    Sort - Lets you sort documents in different ways such as by date added, length, etc. Double tapping this causes a popup menu of options to appear. Flick through them and double tap what you want.
    List View and Grid View - These two options arrange your collection of documents into a grid or list. I find the list view more useful.
    Settings - This causes a popup menu of settings to appear. These let you choose and manage Cloud synchronization, set up content sources like Bookshare, and manage or acquire voices to read your documents. You can also obtain help and a copy of the user manual if needed. The manual is short and takes under half an hour to read through. It is organized into headings. You should read this to get the most out of the app. There is also a shorter Quick Start guide.
    Now Reading - This will always take you directly to where you left off in the last document you were reading. It is always in the bottom-right corner of the library screen. Double tap it to use it.
When Inside a Document:
There are many more actions available from within a document.
    Home - This gets you back to the library screen and is found at the top left of the screen.
    Actions - This presents you with a series of choices, letting you export or share the document. You can also edit the text and title of the document with the Edit option found at the right end of the Action popup menu.
    Reading Settings - There are various reading modes to specify whether you stop after finishing a document, keep going through your collection, read by touching text with your finger, or other options. A timer is available that you can use to stop reading after a given time.
    Audio Settings - This is where you can choose your preferred voice, obtain new voices, and increase or decrease speed, volume, and pitch. This lets you quickly make adjustments. Flick up or down on the Audio Setting button to adjust speed. Double tap it to get to other options used less frequently. There are many voices available. Being a subscriber to this app gives free access to all voices. You can always remove and download them again as needed from the manage voices area in audio settings.
    Visual Settings - There are many options including colour, font, how many lines are visible, cursor position, and much more. These can help people with learning disabilities as well as vision impairments. "Pac-Man mode" is said to help increase reading speed by eliminating words the cursor goes over.
    Add Bookmark - You can add as many bookmarks to documents as you like. This can be useful when a document isn't well formatted and doesn't have headings to help navigate quickly through. Once bookmarks have been placed, you can move back and forth using the Headings, Bookmarks, and Highlights option or via setting the navigation unit to bookmark and then fast-forwarding or rewinding, flicking up or down with the Play button.
    Reading and navigating through a document is done with easily operated controls. Under the area where the text is displayed, there are controls. Touch the bottom right of the screen and flick left, or feel around on the lower left of the screen to find them. You can treat your document like it was music. Play and pause by double tapping the Play button or your EarPod controls. Flick up or down on the Play button to move back and forward. Flick right of the play button to find a Navigation Unit button. This also responds to up or down flicks, letting you choose how much flicking up or down on the Play button moves you. This can depend on how well the document you're reading is formatted. Some don't have headings but still let you move by sentence, paragraph, page, etc. You can also move to the prior or next bookmark if you've created them in the document. If nothing else, you can always move by percentage of the document.
The CELA Digital Library
This service offers a vast array of resources to Canadians who are blind people, visually impaired, or have other print disabilities such as learning difficulties preventing them from reading print. This collection includes audiobooks, magazines, newspapers, and much more. There is no charge for library patrons to use these resources. To register with the website, people will need to know their library account number. If they don't know their account number or need assistance, they should call 1-855-655-2273.
    There is a Help link near the top of the site. This gets you to tutorials and instructions, which are very useful for newcomers to the service. Calling the number given on the site will put people in touch with helpers who can talk you through any initial difficulties and explain things.
    Anybody who used the CNIB digital library before it became the CELA Library will have a valid library account number. They will likely find they are already registered in the system.
    After registration is complete, you can make use of the library and services. People who haven't logged in may still explore the site and gain a good grasp of what is there.
General Overview:
People need to be comfortable browsing the web to make good use of the site. Provided beginners take their time, it is a good site to learn how to browse the web on. No risk of accidental purchases, since there's nothing to buy. It has been designed for maximum accessibility and is easy to navigate. Flicking left and right will get you through the various elements. There are headings marking different key portions of the site, and the rotor is very useful for getting around quickly. We will now take a brief tour of the CELA library website:
My Library:
Near the top of the page is the My Library link. This gets you to where you can customize and manage your service. You can view information on any loans or books you've placed holds on. You can create reading lists. Also, you can change your personal information and password. There are links and headings to help get around. You can change search preferences here, including which accessible formats to include in search results. I did this when I heard about DAISY text magazines being made available the same day they're published in print. By ticking a checkbox, I added the format to my results. I unticked many formats that don't interest me, such as DAISY CDs and other physical formats. If you own a Braille display, books are available in electronic Braille formats. However, I have yet to find an app that makes reading them easy. VoiceOver translates regular ebooks into Braille. You could therefore use Voice Dream Reader to read DAISY text format books on your Braille display.
    After adjusting preferences or other settings, keep flicking right and look for a Save button that you can double tap to save any changes you made.
Recommended:
This area features popular books and recommendations based on current community favourites. Headings separate different groups of recommendations and make browsing through possible next reads easy. There are bestsellers, books focused on a current area of public interest, community picks, and reader suggestions. There is also information on how you can suggest books for recommendation to others, as well as suggest titles to be added to the collection.
Searching for and checking out books:
On the home page, you'll find a form that lets you do simple searches. If you know the title or author of the book you're interested in, type it in that form and flick right to the Search button and double tap it. This will perform the search. Wait around five seconds for the first page of results to load. Each found entry is under its own heading. Turn the rotor to Headings, flicking down to get to the next entry and up to go backwards. Flicking right will let you read any information displayed about the entry. This will include a description. You will come across a Play button, letting you hear samples of audiobooks in Direct to Player format. You'll also come to a Get It button for each entry. Double tap on this to check out the book. Direct to Player titles will be added to your bookshelf. For other titles, such as the new magazines in DAISY text format, you'll need to download them to your reading app of choice. In Safari, you'll find an Open In button with a default app that may be what you want. If not, there's a More button. Double tap that for additional options to appear in a pop-up menu. One of these will be Import to VOICE DREAM READER if you have that app installed.
    To the right of that search button used with the simple search form, there are Advanced Search and Browse by Category options. These let you perform more detailed searches or simply look at what fantasy, science fiction, or non-fiction titles are available. When using the Browse By Category option, a search is performed after you choose a category, and results are ordered by date added. Some categories have subcategories. Take time to examine the site and learn your options.
The Newsstand:
This area gives access to newspapers and magazines. Headings indicate the start of different areas. There are headings for newspapers, audio magazines, DAISY text magazines and other sources of news. Once at a heading of interest, flick right to go through the contents of that area. There's plenty of help available. For instance, when looking through newspapers, you'll find a Help With Newspapers link right above the list of available newspapers.
The Dolphin EasyReader App:

    Available free in the app store or Google Play.
    Many libraries for blind and low-vision patrons around the world offer content in DAISY, ePUB, and other accessible formats. This can include all kinds of traditionally printed publications including newspapers, magazines, and books. Rather than each of these libraries developing their own unique apps, many of them have decided to make use of Dolphin EasyReader.
    The Dolphin EasyReader app lets people easily tap into this content using their Android or iOS devices. Before this initiative, Dolphin was a company from the UK, best known for creating the HAL screen reader and Supernova magnification software. Neither were very widely used in North America, but they were far more successful in Europe. Now, they've created the Dolphin EasyReader app to help people all over the world access library content more easily. This has certainly had the effect of increasing their footprint and notoriety in countries where libraries for blind and print disabled people have chosen to make use of the app. Individual libraries don't have money to spare to develop and maintain their own apps and software. However, as the Marrakesh treaty has enabled more accessible books to be shared internationally, having one app which any special library can use makes a lot of sense.
    A key advantage of this app is that it can handle Direct To Player DAISY books. This format allows library staff to place books on a digital bookshelf for clients and send them directly to their accessible book playing device. This can prove especially helpful for people who might not have the technical skills to search for and download books from a website for themselves. They can instead simply call or email the staff at their digital library and have them set up a flow of new books based on their interests or order particular books for them. Once finished, books can simply be returned, which removes the files from the device, making room for more titles. Dolphin EasyReader lets people use these books on their iOS devices.
    The app has gone through major changes since the last time its information was updated in this guide. For one thing, it is now easy to browse and search libraries for which you have access credentials from inside the app. You no longer need to make use of a web browser. Another major change is a premium subscription option. As of early 2025, the cost is $6.99 per month or $69.99 annually. Benefits include syncing across devices, a wide selection of text to speech voices, access to an app for Macintosh computers, and the ability to access unlimited documents including shared documents, pdfs and material from the clipboard.
    Dolphin has gone to great lengths to keep the app layout as simple as possible. There are no tabs across the bottom. Instead, there is a "side menu" button in the top-left corner. You can double tap that to cause the menu of areas to pop up. At that point, flicking right will take you through the options. Double tap on the one you want. Once you've done that and are in an area, flick right through the contents or options.
My Books:
This is where any books you have on your device will appear. Simply double tap on a book to open it for reading. In case you have many books, there are options to search for and sort the contents.
Manage Libraries:
This is where you can enable or disable libraries which you want to access or don't want in your side menu. Beside the name of each possible library the app supports, you'll find an on/off switch. When that switch shows as on, the library will appear in your side menu as an option. For the ones you would like to access, you'll find that when they're switched on for the first time, a dialog box will appear expecting you to enter your credentials for that library. You only need to do that once and the app will remember them after that.
    After a library is added to the side menu, double tapping on its name causes you to enter into that library's area. In there, you'll find options to browse and search the library. You'll also find any books which you've already put on your device from that library, as well as any books you've added to your bookshelf that you have yet to officially borrow. Beside each book's name, there's a "book information" button. Double tap on that to read information about the book in question. In that information area, you'll find a "borrow" button if you have yet to borrow the book. Double tap on this, and you can then either open the book as a stream or download it to your device. If you're connected to Wi-Fi, streaming works quite well and saves you the storage space the book would otherwise take up. However, if you'll want to read it while away from Wi-Fi, download the book, and it'll be on your device. Once you're finished with the book, the "book information" area has a "return" button, letting you give the book back to the library and freeing any storage space used. Once you've borrowed a book, double tap on its name to be given the option to open it as a stream or download it.
Reading Library Books:
Once you've opened a book as a stream or download, you'll be in the reading area. Here, there are buttons letting you set text and audio preferences. This includes the ability to purchase a selection of reading voices. The visual settings let you control a font and highlighting, among other things. You'll also find a search button for looking within a book for certain words. There's a button called "library" which returns you to the library. If the book includes text, you will find that available. It can be read with VoiceOver using the rotor and other standard reading gestures. Otherwise, you can read it as if it were an audiobook using the next, previous, play/pause and navigation buttons. There are also navigation settings which let you choose how large sections should be, which are jumped to using the previous and next buttons. Daisy books and many ePUB books include headings which are also available using the "navigation" button to discover and jump between. Basically, whether you want simply to enjoy the book reading it cover to cover or use it for reference and jump around, this app has you covered very nicely.
My Newspapers:
At present, this button in the side menu is useless to Canadians, as there aren't any sources of accessible newspapers accessible using this app. It wouldn't surprise me if CELA eventually does something here and makes it possible to access newspapers through this area of the app in addition to what they offer on their website. People with access to services elsewhere in the world can make use of this area in Dolphin EasyReader to consume newspapers and magazines.
My Clipboard:
This lets you read anything that you first copy to the clipboard from another app. I've never had any occasion to use that feature, but it may be practical for people with low vision who aren't familiar with the VoiceOver or zoom features of their iOS device. They could simply copy text to the clipboard and then activate this button to have the text read to them.
Finding Help with Dolphin EasyReader:
When it comes to getting help with the Dolphin EasyReader app, the experience leaves something to be desired. An actual user guide written by the app developers would have been nice. You'll find a button in the side menu which takes you to an online site with a knowledge base and various resources. This has greatly improved since I first wrote about this app in the guide. People can also find help on the CELA library site and on YouTube, where CELA has a series of videos detailing how to use this app. Presumably, other libraries the app provides access to have also created some sort of user help. The RNIB is a good bet there.
My Dolphin Account:
Here, you can log in or out of your Dolphin account. Also, you can decide whether you wish to be notified of any changes to the app via an email. Turn on or off the switch next to the explanatory text to decide this.
Hitting the Cookbooks:
There are countless cookbooks available on both Apple Books and Kindle. In both cases, one issue to be ready to deal with is that unlike other reading, you'll be leaving and then coming back to a recipe as you work on making it. You'll likely need to navigate minutely to hear part of a step again or a number you forgot. Unlike pleasure reading, you'll be making use of the VoiceOver rotor as well as the search and book navigation capabilities of the reading app for which you bought your chosen cookbooks. If you are successful in finding and using a recipe, you'll have the skills you need to tackle using VoiceOver and book reading apps for other productive and academic purposes. This could be a delicious way of mastering some very useful and important VoiceOver skills.
    Below, we'll go through the process of exploring two cookbooks. One of these is in the Apple Books app and the other is using the Kindle app. In each case, we'll find our way to a recipe and discuss how to navigate it. If you prefer one app over the other, chances are good that any cookbook you might wish would be available in your preferred app. In both markets, you should watch for sales and deals that can drastically reduce the cost of wanted books. As the process of acquiring books is covered elsewhere in the guide, this section presumes you know how to do this.
    Before we continue, let's take a moment to think about audiobooks as cooking aids. The reason I have reservations about using a commercially produced audiobook for this purpose is that they aren't all that easy to search. Once you actually get to a recipe, you could easily rewind or fast-forward to find the part of a recipe you need to hear. However, getting to that specific part of an ordinary audiobook would be quite time-consuming, since you can typically only navigate by chapter. What's more, these chapters are normally numbered sequentially rather than named. Also, you couldn't find out how things were spelled without consulting an external source. Ebooks are far smaller, easier to navigate, and spellings are there in full. The only possible downside is that any pictures may not be described.
    Books produced in the DAISY format tend not to be as current, as it can take a while to produce a DAISY copy of a book. However, they are far more navigable, having multiple heading levels as well as often having the complete text. Additionally, any pictures or tables are likely to be fully described and presented in a way that is easy to follow. Apps like the Dolphin EasyReader let you easily download and read DAISY books that are made available through digital libraries for blind and print disadvantaged people. In Canada, the CELA Digital Library is now the resource where these books can be obtained. Once you've signed up and have an account, you can typically access any available books and magazines for free. Using DAISY books with the Dolphin EasyReader app is covered earlier in this section.
Exploring a Cookbook in the Apple Books App:
I began my cookbook exploration with the Books app, figuring that it would be a likely starting point for people with iOS devices. If they are new to the Internet and all things online, it would be a natural first place to go for reading material. Googling around for popular cookbooks, I kept coming up with references to Mark Bittman's How-to Cook Everything. Searching in the Search tab, I rapidly found that the 10th anniversary edition was available for around $25 Canadian. I bought this and then double tapped on the book to open it.
    This book lives up to its name. There are 2,000 recipes and lots of cooking advice contained in over 2,700 pages. In Braille, a book like this would require many volumes and serious shelf space. On my iPhone, it takes up a negligible amount of storage. Double tapping on the book cover opens the book and places you at the introduction. This is on page 22. Most of the space before the introduction contains the table of contents. However, scrolling through these pages with three-finger swipes to the right to go backward or left to go forward reveals a large number of acknowledgements from the author to those who helped him write the book. Rather than having to scroll through the table of contents pages, simply double tap the Table of Contents button, and you'll have it all laid out complete with links you can double tap to get to the indicated section. Once there, touch a little below the top of the screen to get onto the text of the book. You can also flick left or right until you come to book text. At that point, flick down with two fingers to begin continuous reading. Perform a two-finger single tap on the screen to pause and resume reading.
    That takes care of the basics. However, to truly put a book like this to proper use, that VoiceOver rotor needs to come into play. Turn it to Characters, Words, or Lines to look at numbers to make certain you have them right, or find out how to spell the name of a spice you've never heard of before. Many pages contain links that you can get at by turning your rotor to the Links setting. Flicking up or down will move through any links on a page, but won't move beyond a page. Therefore, when you go to the "List of Recipes" in the table of contents, you'll find a page with a single link on it that says "Here". Reading the full text informs you that this link takes you to a specially compiled table of recipes from each chapter. Sadly, the book doesn't make use of headings, so it doesn't appear that there's a quick way to jump to the start of a particular chapter's recipes. You'll need to scroll through the multiple pages of this compiled list using three-finger swipes left or right to move to the next or prior pages. Turn the rotor to links to flick through recipes on that page and also to chapter links. When you move to a different location, give the book up to three seconds to load the new data. It isn't all in memory all the time. The chapter names themselves actually are links, so you'll at least be able to get to the beginning of a chapter's recipes that you're interested in and browse them. If you know the name of what you want to make or find out about, it's likely quicker to use the Search option found near the top of the screen. You can double tap this button, double tap on the search field, and type in the word or words to look for. After typing them, double tap on the Search button on the bottom right of the virtual keyboard. This executes the search. Flick right, and you will find results where the words you have typed appear in the book. The more precise you can be with the name of a recipe or topic of interest, the faster you'll get where you need to be. Often, once you go to a result by double tapping on it, there will often be a link in the text that can take you to a related place in the book with additional information and a specific recipe. This kind of searching isn't quite as intelligent as Google when it comes to what you might intend when you don't know the exact name or words.
    Not all Apple Books are created equal. You may find that some cookbooks have better navigational aids than others. Also, keep in mind that these books and apps are designed for sighted people. If you could see the context in which your search results appeared, it might be quicker to pick out the start of a recipe from a simple mention of your terms somewhere else in the text. The more familiar with a book's structure you are, the faster you'll be able to get where you need to.
How to Find a Chicken Recipe:
I love eating chicken for dinner. Mostly, I keep things simple and use boneless chicken breasts that I throw on the electric grille or in the oven. No doubt, there are many things to add to chicken that I've never considered. A cookbook like How to Cook Everything likely has useful information and perhaps a different recipe or two. Let's see about finding one.
First Method
1. Open the How-to Cook Everything cookbook in Apple Books by double tapping on its cover. You are welcome to use a less-expensive cookbook here, but be aware that best navigation techniques may differ.
2. One easy way to start would be to go to the Table of Contents and find a chapter related to what you're interested in. Double tap the Table of Contents button and then touch the screen a little below the top. Once you find chapter names, flick left or right to start moving through the list of them. Double tap on the chapter you want. In this case, chapter 11 is called Poultry. Within seconds, we're a thousand pages into the book at the start of the chapter. You could then start reading continuously through the chapter, learning all about cooking different birds, including chicken. Turning the rotor to links and flicking down, you quickly come to Roasted Chicken Parts. Double tap on that link to get to this recipe.
3. You could continue to look through the pages of this chapter by performing a three-finger swipe to the left, advancing page by page. On each page, you could then turn the rotor to links, flicking down to see what recipes are linked to on each page.
Second Method:
1. Let's make use of that list of recipes, so we can look through related choices. Double tap on the Table of Contents button, and then flick right to find the List of Recipes after the introduction. Double tap on this to get to the page.
2. Turn the rotor to links and flick down to get to the Here link. Double tap on this, and you'll be taken to the start of the table of recipes.
3. To navigate this mammoth list, turn the rotor to links and flick up or down to move between recipes on that page. Remember that passing the top- or bottom-most link on the page and continuing in the same direction wraps around to the opposite link. If you find a recipe of interest, double tap on it to be taken there. If not, simply do a three-finger swipe to the left to go to the next page. Remember that the chapter on poultry is chapter 11, so you can quickly scroll through earlier pages, checking for the Chapter 11 link. Once you find that, you're in the right area of this list and should proceed more slowly. Check the recipes on each page and then do a three-finger swipe to the left to move onward to a new page of recipe links. Your rotor may end up switching to actions as you move from page to page, so if you hear something unexpected, turn the rotor to links and continue browsing.
4. I browsed through a number of pages in chapter 11 before finding a recipe for Roast Chicken and New Potatoes. I double tapped on this link and was taken right to the start of the recipe. It sounds delicious and is designed so everything cooks at once. I can set the rotor to lines, reading step by step through the recipe as I need to. I could also use other features of the Books app to cut and paste the recipe into a note or another app. More simply, I could double tap the Bookmark button and mark that page, so I could quickly get to the start of the recipe when needed.
Third Method:
1. I feel like bacon and eggs this morning, but am curious to see if there might be an interesting and tasty way of doing my favourite breakfast that I haven't experienced. This seems like a suitable candidate for using the Search button, so I double tap that and type "bacon and eggs" into the search field and double tap the Search button in the bottom right of the screen.
2. Flicking right, I pass the Text heading. Any results from the book will be below or to the right of this heading. I'm disappointed that there are only five hits for the phrase "bacon and eggs". Not being a pasta fan, the most promising hit here would be the "Warm Spicy Greens with Bacon and Eggs". It's not really what I'm after, though.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with different words to continue searching. While this book has 2,000 recipes, it seeks to go a bit beyond the humble bacon and egg breakfast. Perhaps, a different approach might yield interesting stuff. I try just typing "bacon" into the search field. There are well over a hundred hits. One of the first of these is a section on "The Basics of Cooking Bacon". That might yield appealing results. I'd certainly learn something exciting about one of my favourite foods. Proceeding further, we come across bacon as an ingredient in many recipes. While I didn't go through these exhaustively, I didn't come across any nifty alterations to my cherished breakfast. Perhaps, searching for "eggs" or "breakfast" would turn up something intriguing. Certainly, worth a look.
Other cookbooks may yield recipes more quickly. This one is geared towards teaching about how to cook different foods, more than being a searchable repository of recipes. People need to think of these cookbooks differently than they think of searching the web. They are more about cooking technique, theory, and advice than about collecting recipes.
Exploring Cookbooks Using the Kindle App:
The Kindle app approaches displaying and navigating books quite differently. The book takes up the entire screen once opened. To search a book's text or access the navigation menu, simply double tap on the text of the book with one finger. Flick right to go through the options of this main menu. Double tap on Search to look for words similar to the search method shown in the Apple Books section. Double tap on the Navigation Drawer, and the table of contents is all right there. Just flick right through the options and double tap on the part of the book that interests you. The book text will appear, and you just flick down with two fingers to begin continuous reading.
    Decisions made by publishers concerning how to make their cookbooks easy to navigate can have tremendous consequences for prospective blind readers. In the preceding example using the Books app, we saw that it was somewhat challenging to actually find out about and get at a certain recipe. While I would maintain the book is fully accessible and useable, it wasn't as easy as it could have been. Users of How to Cook Everything will need to spend more time becoming familiar with the book and what's in it before using it when time is of the essence. That isn't the fault of Apple Books as much as it is the book crafters who put it together. I have the same edition of How to Cook Everything for Kindle. Unlike the Books app, things are less cluttered in the Kindle app. Since the book takes up the whole screen, it's impossible to accidentally touch anything but the book text. Exploring the list of recipes seems far less difficult. When you reach the last link in a page, the cursor doesn't rap around to the top like in the Books app. I prefer things this way when it comes to exploring a link list on a page. If it doesn't continue over page boundaries, better than one have a clear sense of top and bottom. Scrolling between pages is much faster, and feeling around the screen for recipes rather than going link by link is a bit easier. Had headings been implemented, it would have been easier to get to things like the start of recipes in a particular chapter. Overall, I think How to Cook Everything really ought to be made into a DAISY audiobook. This would allow for such measures to be taken and make the book easier to quickly jump around in. This book is yet another example of the economic advantage of going Kindle. I bought the Kindle edition of this book when it was on sale for $2.99 Canadian. Broadening your horizons and learning to browse the web can really pay off.
    That takes care of basic navigation of a Kindle book. Now, we'll go beyond that and attempt to put an actual cookbook to use, like we did with the Apple Books app. For this demonstration, I decided to obtain The New Essentials Cookbook: A Modern Guide to Better Cooking by America's Test Kitchen. It's quite a bit smaller, coming in at 496 pages and 200 recipes. As with How to Cook Everything, this cookbook seeks to teach cooking basics and techniques as well as provide a good collection of recipes. At the time of purchase, the price was $7.99 Canadian. I stumbled onto this one and the description seemed to fit the bill. A modern cookbook that tries to teach cooking basics and has recipes for everyone.
    This is far less expensive Kindle cookbook turns out to be as accessible as one could hope for from an ebook. The New Essentials Cookbook has links to all recipes in each section right at the start of the section. Therefore, you can use the Navigation Drawer to go to a section of interest and immediately turn your rotor to links, flicking down to go through links to all breakfast recipes in the book. Double tapping a link takes you right to the start of that recipe. It doesn't get better than that. Let's take a closer look:
How to Find Recipes Using the Kindle App:
Suppose my wife and I are planning a dinner with a few friends. We plan to have this dinner after we order a batch of groceries, so we'll have an opportunity to obtain any ingredients we might need. All of us enjoy chicken, so that seems like a good anchor for this browsing. We're thinking of something that is a bit more involved to make than what we'd do ordinarily.
1. I double tap the book's text and bring up the menu. Flicking right, I find the Navigation Drawer and double tap that. Next, I flick right to get a sense of what sections are in the book. Pretty soon, I arrive at "Dinner At A Glance". That sounds promising. I double tap on that, which takes me to the start of the section.
2. I begin reading by flicking down with two fingers. Furthermore, I learn that this list contains all the main dishes in the book, listed by category. Sounds perfect. I quickly run into the start of the list of links and discover that pasta comes first.
3. I've never cared for pasta, so I swipe left with three fingers to skip forward over a page. Furthermore, I let it read down a number of links and hear chicken dishes begin to dominate. That's what I'm after.
4. I turn the rotor to links and flick down to browse more carefully. I double tap on links that interest me and read through the recipes. When I want to get back to the list, I go into the navigation menu and return to the "Dinner At A Glance" section. I could use the Bookmark feature to put a bookmark just before the recipe I'm thinking of looking at, so I can return more precisely to the point I reached on the list.
5. Lime Ginger Chicken and Rice with EDAMAME and SHIITAKES sounds delightful. I read over the recipe to familiarize myself with it and then make certain I return to the beginning of it so that I can get at the parts I need. The Kindle app doesn't quite trust its readers enough to let you use standard copy and paste capabilities. You would therefore need to use Kindle's somewhat unwieldy system to highlight and copy a recipe into another app. The same sort of restriction applies to the Books app.
Reading DAISY Cookbooks with the Dolphin EasyReader App:
With a DAISY-formatted book, be it audio or text or both, all accessibility concerns have been thought through. This makes the material as accessible to non-visual readers as humanly possible. Pictures are described. Charts and tables are read in a way that's easy to follow. Any accessibility problems will have been thought through and addressed if at all possible. The multiple levels of headings allow for easy and quick exploration. Apps like Dolphin EasyReader and Voice Dream Reader can read these DAISY format books.
    Until recently, people would have to wait quite a long time and hope that their accessible digital library chose to produce a requested book in DAISY format. Only a fraction of the total books out there are available in this format. However, recent treaties have been agreed to that should drastically improve the selection in the English-speaking countries who are signatories. Publishers are now more willing to provide access to resources such as already-recorded audiobook narration. This should further increase book selection and modernity.
    For this demonstration, I obtained the Complete Canadian Living Cookbook by Elisabeth Baird. It contains 350 recipes, as well as lots of nutrition information and cooking advice. The book is around 350 MB in size. Daisy books contain recorded audio, so they're larger than ebooks. Daisy textbooks also contain the text of the book that can be read by VoiceOver using either synthetic speech or a Braille display. At the very least, DAISY audiobooks will contain text headings in a multilevel structure that allows the reader to quickly browse and jump to sections of interest.
Conclusion:
When it comes to accessing digital books, things have only gotten better since the first edition was published. I have continued to add to my large collection. I am forever curious about lives lived differently to my own. Reading about science, technology, how things work, how they're designed and built, and many more topics occur to me. Usually, I don't have to work too hard to find a book which scratches that itch. And then, there's fiction and imagination. So much out there to enjoy.
    For me, this new ability to tap into digital libraries and make use of the same commercial sources of ebooks available to the general population has been one of the most astonishing and liberating expansions of capability I've ever experienced. I hope what I've written here helps others to become more liberated in their reading, as I have. Even on a fixed income, it's possible to enjoy what your friends and family are reading at the same time as the discoveries are still fresh for them. Over time, you can build a staggeringly large collection and have it with you wherever you happen to be. Pick your moments and keep a sharp ear out for sales. There are doubtless many sources I have remained unaware of. Those that I've covered above have kept me well supplied with books. I've found that if I'm willing to look around for different potential sources for a book I'm interested in, I can usually get it in a format which I can read on my iPhone.
    Over time, I've found that the prices for ebooks have increased, so they don't destroy the market for physical books. After a while, though, the price for a given ebook will drop permanently, or it will go on sale more often. Patience and vigilance really pay off when shopping for books. I hope that all of my readers can share in the joy of reading, whether it be from digital libraries or by purchasing their books as I have. There are so many excellent books out there. If you'd care for some suggestions, I've included a list of some favourite finds below:
Some of My Favourite Ebooks and Audiobooks:
I've already gone over the best book sources and apps. Below, I'll let you in on some of my absolute favourite authors and books.
Ted Chiang:
Short story collections are handy things to have. There are times when novels are too big to get into, but you still want to while away some time without being left hanging. Ted writes some absolute top-tier science fiction short stories. They're some of the most carefully constructed ones I've ever come across. There are currently two collections. The earlier one is called Stories of Your Life and Others. One story from that collection was adapted into the very popular science fiction film called Arrival. Another favourite from that book is called Liking What You See. It imagines what effect a technology which eliminated the ability to perceive difference in how attractive or unattractive people looked would have on a school campus. All the stories are engaging and make you think. His second collection is called Exhalation. It also has a number of pricelessly good stories. In particular, I direct your attention to one called Truth of Fact Truth of Feeling. It's all about the effect of writing on culture and the prospect of being able to record one's entire life. Another great one in that book is called Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom. It concerns whether it's possible to have morality in a multiverse, where any choice you make in one universe might be made differently by a parallel you in another universe.
Charles de Lint:
I was first introduced to this author through a book called Spirits in the Wires. It was read by a pair of splendid volunteer narrators and made available on the CELA Digital Library. In the modern city of Newford, strange things are happening to the Internet. Strange supernatural things. People are appearing in the city who have memories of past lives that never happened. Other supernatural beings inhabit the city, and it falls to a group of people drawn together by these odd circumstances to avert disaster. I'll never forget how drawn into the story I felt while listening to this book.
    Charles writes absolutely excellent urban fantasy where myth and magic come up against modern-day life. These books are written for young adults and deal with some serious issues. However, he still manages to pack an astounding amount of humanity, hope, and wonder into his stories. You can get most of his books on Kindle. On Audible, pickings are more scarce. However, I would direct you to Dreams Underfoot. It's a splendid collection of short stories narrated by Kate Reading. It's available in other ebook formats too. Another collection of short stories called The Very Best of Charles de Lint would also serve as an exceptional starting place. You can't really go wrong with Charles de Lint.
Robert J. Sawyer:
Rob writes optimistic science fiction of the highest caliber. I can't remember whether my first introduction to his work was Starplex or Calculating God. Both would make excellent first reads from him. Starplex is set in the far future and is something akin to Star Trek. It's my favourite of his far future books and concerns a science exploration ship that gets caught up in galactic politics. It explores all kinds of substantial issues, including love, long life, and time itself. Mark Boyett narrates this book for Audible, and there's an introduction read by Robert J. Sawyer himself. I'll take that any day you like over an autograph I can't see.
    Calculating God is another all-time favourite. It is set in the present day as aliens arrive at the Royal Ontario Museum. They come with proof of God's existence in the form of evidence that extinction level events seem to have been managed, happening simultaneously on worlds with intelligent life separated by lightyears. Questions of faith, family, science, and mortality are all artfully considered in this excellent novel. It's available in all kinds of formats. The Audible narration is done by Jonathan Davis, with an introduction read by Robert J. Sawyer. Other recommendations include Space, Earth, and Time. These recently published collections of his short stories are available on Kindle, among other places, and are very affordably priced. He also does splendid trilogies. In particular, check out the WWW Trilogy that features a blind heroine. Audible uses a cast of narrators. Alternatively, you can obtain the trilogy as a single ebook on Kindle or other ebook formats. I eagerly await his next novel, which commemorates the 75th anniversary of the dropping of the first atomic bomb. The Oppenheimer Alternative posits an alternate history where scientists involved in the creation of the atomic bomb attempt to find redemption for what they have unleashed on the world. Whatever this entails, I have no doubt that Robert J. Sawyer will deliver a novel that is true to the real life characters he depicts and contains his trademark thoughtfulness and optimism.
Corey Mintz:
The pandemic has deeply effected the restaurant and food business. Hearing the author interviewed on a CBC radio show, I decided to get his book, called The Next Supper. It takes a deep dive behind the scenes of the food we enjoy while eating out or ordering in. The book gives us a good understanding of what conditions are like for the people who make the food in restaurants, as well as what it's like for business owners. Corey narrates his own book with great skill and has years of experience in the food industry to draw upon. Sufficed to say, I'll never quite think about eating out the same way again.
Kim Stanley Robinson:
In early 2022, I came across a book called The Ministry For The Future. Kim Stanley Robinson set out to write the most optimistic path humanity could take dealing with climate change, which he could still believe in as credible. This book was as fascinating and uplifting as it was horrific to read. I was pulled along by the characters and situations from beginning to end. The version on Audible is narrated by a large cast of top-notch narrators. A very timely and interesting find.
Douglas Abrams:
If you need something uplifting and engaging, Douglas Abrams has co-authored two books I particularly enjoyed. I first encountered his work in The Book of Joy. In it, he speaks to the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu about joy. His conversation with these two great spiritual thinkers is very wide-ranging and absolutely precious. In the latest book, The Book of Hope, Jane Goodall is his interviewee in a fascinating look into her life and the nature and importance of hope. She narrates her half of the conversation plus an introduction in the Audible version.
Frozen In Time; The Fate of the Franklin Expedition:
Three authors, including Owen Beattie, contributed to this book about the expedition, which fascinated me ever since I first heard of it in grade school history classes. At last, all these years later, the two ships have been discovered. I got this as a Kindle book after making certain that the text to speech and screen reader support was included. I anticipate being utterly swept along by this book once I have published this edition of the guide.
Cliff Kuang and Robert Fabricand:
User Friendly; How the Hidden Rules of Design are changing how we Live, Work and Play. This book is a real masterpiece. I learned a lot about objects in my life which I hadn't previously given a second's thought about. Reading about the design process behind all kinds of everyday objects was absolutely fascinating. It absolutely consumed me for hours at a stretch.
Mark Miodownik:
As a boy, he was stabbed with a razor blade while running away from a robber. Amazed how such a thin, small blade could go through a leather jacket and injure him, he grew up to become a materials scientist. He has hosted a documentary on Netflix called Everyday Miracles that is well worth hearing. He has also written two fascinating books about the materials that so fascinate him.
    Stuff Matters and Liquid Rules are both full of insights and explanations about why and how we use various materials. I have yet to encounter a more engaging author in this area of expertise. Both books are as entertaining as they are informative. Michael Page narrates them beautifully for Audible. They are also available on Kindle and Apple Books.
Books About Game Design:
I have long been interested in how games work and the thought that goes into creating them. Until perhaps ten or fifteen years ago, it was nearly impossible to find any books on this topic that were accessible to blind people. Game design books don't tend to be bestsellers. Not everyone wants to look behind the curtain of their fun. These days, a great many books about game design are available as ebooks. There are even a few audiobooks, either produced by Kickstarter campaigns or narrated for Audible.
    The VitalSource Bookshelf app was designed for everyone, but attention was paid to making the app and textbooks that use it accessible to blind people. You can get these books from CRC Press. While saving up for university courses is beyond the means of many blind people, saving up for a few textbooks on subjects of particular interest is possible. A few favourites from this source are:
    The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses by Jesse Schell. This book offers over a hundred aspects of game creation as lenses through which to view the game you're working on. It is very approachable and useful to a beginning game designer. Even people who have a casual interest in such matters will find this book easy to follow and a delight to read.
    Making Deep Games by Doris C. Rusch. This book explores what it takes to design a meaningful game containing choices that truly matter to players. If you're interested in making a game whose impact is felt beyond the experience itself, this book will help you do that. Again, even if your interest in games is only casual, this book will be easy to follow and provide plenty of food for thought.
    Coming down from textbook level, you can find plenty of books to help with game design on Kindle or Apple Books. For a good set of starting books, type "Kobold Guide" into the search box in Apple Books or while in the Kindle Books category of the Amazon site. These books contain advice and thinking from some of the best minds in the business of game design. It's all written to be easy to approach, even for newcomers to this area of interest.
Robert van Gulik:
This Dutch diplomat left an indelible mark on my teenage reading life with his stories about a 7th century Chinese magistrate known as Judge Dee. Although the stories in van Gulik's books are fictional, they are based upon a real historical figure noted for his ability to solve crimes in ancient China. Judge Dee is as widely known in China as Sherlock Holmes is in the western world. My parents borrowed a copy of the book Judge Dee at Work from our local public library. It was narrated onto cassette tapes by Frank Muller. He did a masterful job reading the eight stories in a very engaging way. Although the stories were somewhat modified to make them more suitable to western audiences, they are still markedly different from other mysteries. Van Gulik also provides some fascinating insights about differences between Chinese detective story traditions and those of the west.
    I was happy to find that the many Judge Dee books written by van Gulik are available on Apple Books and Kindle. It's hard to go wrong with any of the Judge Dee books. They're all well worth picking up, but be certain to find the cheaper versions. The books have been published with better illustrations, which are useless to totally blind readers.
Simon Winchester:
This man has travelled widely and written about all sorts of fascinating places. He also narrates his own books and does so exquisitely well. He has written about the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and about the people and places found in and around them. Most recently, I enjoyed a book he wrote called The Perfectionists where he examined how precision engineering has helped shape our modern life. Another area he has written extensively about is the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. Any lover of words and human endeavour will deeply appreciate his books on this subject or, frankly, any other he decides to take an interest in.
Larry Niven and Steven Barnes:
These two authors have often collaborated on wonderful science fiction stories. The Dream Park series was first mentioned to me by a friend in secondary school, who knew of my interest in games and technology. My father read the first of the books, Dream Park, aloud to me. At the time, none were available in accessible format. Set in a future California ravaged by a massive earthquake, Dream Park blends live action adventure roleplaying games with science fiction and a murder mystery. The stories are told from the perspective of the security chief at Dream Park as he tries to keep everyone safe and solve crimes.
    I was thrilled when I could finally purchase all four books in the Dream Park series from Audible, narrated by Stefan Rudnicki. These copies don't seem to be available in the Canadian Audible store. However, the books are available, narrated by the equally skillful Grover Gardener. The series really hits its peak in the third book, which is called The California Voodoo Game. However, all four books are very much worth reading. They are all available on Apple Books and Kindle.
Stephen King:
I love a good spooky tale, and few can match what Stephen King has accomplished in this area. His books have been a part of my reading life from teenage years onward. He often narrates his own books, which are available on Audible. If Mr. King isn't reading one of his books himself, you can bet that the narrator who is will be one of the best in the business. A few absolute favourite books of his are The Green Mile, The Stand, and Bazaar of Bad Dreams. All of his books are available on Kindle and Apple Books as ebooks. It's an excellent bet that nearly all of his work will be available in your accessible library. He is one of the most popular American authors alive. As I complete this list in early 2022, I have deeply enjoyed The Institute, which set back the completion of the first edition of this guide by a few days. His latest collection of novellas, If It Bleeds, was absolutely superb and even included one spooky story about an iPhone. I couldn't put that book down until I had devoured it all. His next book is called Fairy Tale and you can bet I've pre-ordered it already. It's due out in the Autumn of 2022. By the way, his son, Joe Hill, is no slouch in this department either. His latest collection of short stories is called Full Throttle. I found all the stories to be quite captivating. Audible has an excellent cast of narrators reading Mr. Hill's stories. This book makes a splendid companion to Bazaar of Bad Dreams in ebook or audiobook form.
The Expanse:
Written by two different authors under the joint pseudonym of James S. A. Cory, this magnificent and thought-provoking series of science fiction books is gritty and creepy. It shows an all too realistic portrayal of what sort of societies we might build as we expand into the stars. Full of war, technology, and politics, this series is really a look at human character at its best and worst. I've thoroughly enjoyed all nine books in the main series. There is also a collection of short stories you can get in a tenth books called Memory's Legion. It's also well worth reading. All the Expanse books are available as ebooks on Kindle and Apple Books. Audible has them narrated by Jefferson Maze, who does a consistently brilliant job. The only series I can think of that has come anywhere near close to this one regarding world building was David Brin's Uplift series. An incredible amount of thought went into the universe in which these stories are set and how we might get from where we are today to where the characters find themselves. It's not such a long walk.
Audiobooks About Words and Language:
Audible makes a wide range of books available specifically about language and words. Hearing these read aloud is wonderful, since it eliminates the need to wonder how unusual words are actually pronounced. Many of my audible credits have gone towards books and "Great Courses" about words and language. Here are some of my favourites in this category:
    Mark Forsyth has a number of books about unusual words and strange word associations. The Etymologicon takes listeners on a ramble through words that are somehow connected with each other. Hours of fun word exploration on tap there. Another great book of his, The Horologicon, takes us through a day and lets us hear about words that used to be a part of that day for English speakers but are now unused. I found this book absolutely spellbinding. My wonder at lost words never stopped until the narrator did.
    John McWhorter has narrated his own books in addition to a number of Great Courses all about language and how it develops and changes. I particularly enjoyed Words On The Move, Myths and half Truths about Language, and Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue. John is fun to listen to and very knowledgeable without being stuffy about it. You can feel his joy as he teaches about the oddities of English as well as other languages.
    Here are a few more wonderful authors and lecturers who have graced my Audible collection. Anne Curzan has done two Great Courses that I'll always keep handy. I deeply enjoyed The Secret Life of Words and English Grammar Bootcamp. Both courses are well worth the Audible credit. Her wealth of knowledge is tremendous, and she delivers her lectures with warmth and humour. Gretchen McCulloch recently published a remarkable book called Because Internet. This explores how the Internet has changed language and how we communicate with each other. It's a fascinating and funny eight-hour read. Finally, consider the delightful author Phil Cousineau. He has written numerous books that are all about language. Wordcatcher, Burning The Midnight Oil, and The Painted Word will all tickle the language lover's fancy. All of these books can be had as ebooks or audiobooks.
Rose George:
I well remember hearing this lady interviewed on a radio show called The Next Chapter. It was soon after Kindle had made its iPhone app accessible. She spoke of her adventures investigating how all the stuff in our lives is transported around the world, mainly by cargo ship. She decided to find out what life was like for the sailors in that industry. The book was called Ninety Percent of Everything, and it's well worth reading. For me, it'll always be additionally special as it was, so far as I can recall, the first time I heard about a book and was able to simply buy it immediately. That in itself was absolutely magical. The adventures and insights Rose filled the pages with certainly kept me interested.
Spider Robinson:
This author of science fiction is as funny as he is thoughtful. One of my most treasured acquisitions from Audible is an audiobook called The Callahan Chronicles. As far as I can find, it only exists as an audiobook. Basically, it combines three separate collections of short stories written over twenty years about a bar somewhere in North America. Only people who really need to find it seem to come there. It's a very special place full of crazy characters, puns, wordplay, and barroom philosophy. For those who need adventures filled with delightful puns and wordplay, this book is definitely for you. It's around sixteen hours total and a delight from beginning to end. Audible has other books in the Callahan's Place series that are also well worth hearing. Some of these are also available as ebooks.
Erin Morgenstern:
One of my last acquisitions in 2019 was a truly remarkable modern fantasy by this author called The Starless Sea. Years ago, I was deeply taken with her previous novel called The Night Circus. Erin's second novel completely eclipses her first in every possible way. It's a fantasy crafted for lovers of books and stories. In other words, me. It follows the adventures of a college student in media studies who discovers a library book that seems to contain a story of his own childhood. Since the book is far older than he is, this should be impossible. There are hints of a magical place just out of reach for most of us where stories come alive. Once, as a child, he walked away from a painted door that looked so real he was afraid to open it. Now, as an adult, he is eager for a second chance to step through. This examination of books, stories, video games, and much else besides is an absolutely spellbinding read. Audible has chosen to have a number of people narrate the book. I most definitely recommend The Starless Sea in ebook or audio form.

Work and Productivity on iOS Devices:
I've become relatively used to being on a TV show and, more recently, YouTube. As a regular contributor, I need to come up with ideas and notes for show segments having to do with audio entertainment enjoyable by blind people. Previously, my portfolio for the show also included segments about accessible technology, focussed heavily on iPhones. The Kelly and Company show can be watched weekday afternoons on YouTube or at:
    www.amiplus.ca
    It can also be heard on TV on the AMI Audio channel or enjoyed as a podcast. It's a show catering to an audience largely composed of people with disabilities. The show has me as its first regular contributor on every other Friday.
    I use many apps on my iPhone to prepare for these segments. The Safari browser and the Notes app help me search for new material and keep track of my thoughts about the topic of discussion. I provide the show hosts with background notes and potential questions to ask me using the Ulysses app. Other apps come into play when it's time to record my segment. I can't think of a better demonstration of how I use my iPhone to get work done than taking you on a journey through that process.
    The Calendar app has given me an alert that it's nearly time to do my show segment. The show is now pre-recorded, but done as if it were live. As ten o'clock approaches, I do last-minute preparations for the segment I'll be presenting. This involves turning on the lights which are otherwise very seldom used in the apartment. I must also move some items from their ordinary positions on the back of our couch lest they find themselves in my iPhone's camera view.
    The VMIX site needs to be in the foreground in order for the iPhone camera to transmit my image. I therefore mount my newest iPhone on a small stand on my desk. I use my older iPhone paired with my Braille display to read the short form notes I've prepared. They contain parts of answers, including such things as the names of actors, which I'm liable to forget under the pressure of doing a live broadcast. As best as memory permits, I adjust my chair hight and the position of the iPhone in the stand to what I remember it feeling like last time. This will hopefully speed up the final adjustments and framing that the people in the studio need to do on their end. I realize I've done all I can in terms of memorizing information and preparing. I go into an email and click on the link to the web-based recording app they want me in. After entering my credentials, I'm quickly connected. I set the focus to a special mode I've made for work, so nothing can interrupt me during the broadcast. Next, presuming I've been connected, I turn my iPhone sideways and put it in the stand. This gives the best possible picture through its front facing camera. This camera is better suited to the situation than the rear one, which takes much wider shots.
    The segment started as an idea to review the latest Sherlock Holmes drama produced by Big Finish at the time. My wife and I used the Big Finish app to listen to the drama I'd be discussing. Using that same app, I was able to skip around in the drama to refresh my memory on parts while writing my notes. The Safari app was useful for quickly visiting the Big Finish site and checking the spelling of the names of cast members. Using the initial notes taken from the website and written in the Notes app, I then turned to the Ulysses app to write suggested questions and background information for the show hosts and staff. I used the Gmail app to send them in.
    With the clock ticking down towards showtime, I make certain my other iPhone has the short form notes ready and that I'm where I want to be in the file. I have them ready in the Ulysses app. I'm connected to the show output now and can hear the broadcast in my wired earpods. The audiovisual producer comes on and talks me through final adjustments, so I'm as well situated in the field of view as possible. The show goes into a break before my segment, which gives me a chance to take a quick sip of water and get ready. I make certain that VoiceOver speech is disabled on the older iPhone with my notes. As long as I don't hit the wrong button on the display, things will go fine. The break ends, and my pre-recorded introduction plays as I'm connected into the live show. It's showtime.
    If any device on the planet has totally outgrown its name, it is the iPhone. Initially, when iPhones and iPads first appeared, they weren't thought of as much more than consumption devices. However, they have gained so much in computing power and functionality over the years that it now seems ludicrous to use them merely for communication and entertainment. People have developed countless apps designed to help create things or complete tasks. Using only your iOS device, it is possible to create presentations, write books, produce videos, compose music, record and broadcast podcasts, and plenty more besides. Unconfined by physical constraints imposed by purpose-built devices, your iPhone, or iPad can become whatever might be needed for a particular purpose. Require a different keyboard for more efficient calculations? No problem! Would larger keys let you type better in a word-processing app? That's no problem either. How about virtual Braille keys? That can work too. Need a handy surface to sketch or paint on? If you have an iPad or iPhone, you have what you need. There are enough touch sensors and pixels to make an incredibly versatile interface possible, and enough computing power to put that flexibility to tremendous use.
    Through Bluetooth connectivity, it is even possible to take control of hardware, provided that an app is created to allow for this. Such hardware includes accessories like printers, keyboards, microwave ovens, etc. There are other, more advanced possibilities that might also include 3D printers or other machines that can literally create or process objects. Some lab equipment can be controlled using apps on an iOS device. In 2019, an Apple design award was won by a system that allowed doctors in third-world countries to control low-cost MRI imaging equipment to make diagnoses.
    Due largely to economics, I have no experience with such things as 3D printers or smart kitchen appliances. In this section of Personal Power, we'll therefore focus on the apps that, when combined with capabilities present in your iOS device, let you unleash your productive and creative mental energies to good effect. Most of these apps don't come preinstalled with iOS, so you'll need to pay a visit to the app store to obtain them. Some of them are free for the taking. Others will have a one-time cost or will be based on a subscription model where you pay to use the app or service on an ongoing basis. Perhaps, you'll learn about an app that allows you to pursue your own personal creative, scholarly, or business-related interests and goals.
    In writing this section, I am very conscious of the limits of my own explorations and experience with apps outside of those that pertain to writing. While I've heard of blind people producing YouTube videos, creating movies with Apple's iMovie app, creating music with GarageBand, recording podcasts, and many more things besides, I have largely stuck to what I myself have more familiarity with in writing this section. Therefore, I urge you to keep in mind that this is just the tip of the iceberg of possibilities. There are doubtless many apps that hold as yet undiscovered potential for productivity. Don't take this section as the sum total of possibilities. Rather, use the skills I discuss here and in other sections of this guide to find ways of accomplishing things. I would especially direct you to the section called Accessible Games on iOS. The skills you'll learn through games are often the very same skills in operating apps that will serve you well when you try to do work.
    Rather than going into great detail about how to use each of the apps covered in this section, I'll trust that people have gained the skills they need to explore and use apps. I'll take deeper dives into a smaller selection of apps using them as instructive examples of techniques or conventions common in productivity related apps.
    Generally speaking, people should go in with the presumption that there is likely an app that would help accomplish a given task. However, that app might not be accessible using VoiceOver. Unfortunately, there are apps which might very well be too visual in their construction to allow for a different mode of access. In far too many instances, it's simply a case of a lack of awareness or willingness on the part of an app's developers to take the time and effort to make use of accessibility features. Should you find an inaccessible app, taking the time to contact the developer and express your interest in it as a potential blind user would be a good idea. There have been many cases of apps being made accessible and support for VoiceOver being added once developers have been made aware of the accessibility difficulties and the tools Apple provides to surmount them. Before you look at more costly alternatives, let's briefly go over the collection of apps that Apple makes freely available to all iOS users.
The Notes App:
If you need to quickly dictate or type notes, you'll want to check out the Notes app included with iOS. If you need to organize a whole lot of personal information, connected ideas, transcribe lectures, keep sensitive information secure, and a whole lot more, the Notes app also has you covered. As its name implies, this app lets you easily create notes. However, lately, Apple has put considerable effort into developing their once basic app into something which truly raises the bar for the many third-party notes related apps found later in this section. People with very specific needs may still find third-party apps which offer features not found in the Notes app. However, they'll find it more of a struggle to justify the time and expense of choosing them over what Apple includes free in iOS. It can absolutely serve as a basic note-taking app. I originally included it in the section on lifestyle apps meant to make everyday life easier. However, it has now gotten so powerful that it truly belongs in the productivity section of this book. For the majority of average users, Apple's Notes app now does more than you'll ever need.
    The Notes app is fully integrated with all accessibility iOS features. This typically means that it is more reliably accessible than some third-party alternatives. Occasionally, there can still be issues with VoiceOver doing odd things like jumping to the top of a note for no apparent reason. Once Apple is made aware of such problems, they are usually addressed relatively quickly.
    Siri and Apple Intelligence can both be used in conjunction with the Notes app and other apps made by Apple or third parties. This allows for your notes to be typed in or dictated. Using Siri, you can ask it to create a new note and tell it what you want it to include. They can be summarized, proofread or re-written in a different way if you have an iPhone capable of supporting Apple Intelligence. You can also lock notes so they require a passcode, Face or Touch ID to access. For people with useable vision, there are facilities for basic drawing, so you can add simple pictures or diagrams to your notes. Your notes can also be shared with others who can collaborate with you. Notes can be formatted extensively. In fact, some people find the Notes app serves their word processing needs quite well.
    Notes can be organized to a high degree. Links can be made between related notes. Using hashtags and smart folders, it is possible to have notes present in the contexts where they make sense. Rather than use a third-party app, with a little extra effort, it is quite possible to use the Notes app to build what is called a personal knowledge system which links all of your important notes with hub or home notes for given areas of interest or endeavour.
    The layout of the Notes app is simple. There is a folder browser on the left with a Back or edit button at the very top. When you're in a folder, you'll find a "Folder Actions" button. This gives access to options letting you turn gallery view on or off, organize and sort notes within the folder, etc.
    A default Notes folder is created for you, which is nested in the iCloud folder. This makes certain that your notes are kept synchronized between devices by default. It also makes certain that your notes are backed up regularly to iCloud. If you prefer, you can set up your notes to use a folder which only exists on your iPhone. These won't be backed up to the cloud or synched with notes elsewhere so I wouldn't recommend this unless special circumstances demand that.
    . You will also find a search field allowing you to look for particular notes. There is also a sort selector. By default, your notes are kept sorted by "date last edited". Double tapping this button reveals that you can also have your notes sorted by "date created" or by "note title". You can set the default to whichever style you would prefer when the app first opens. The More button lets you select notes and perform additional functions on them once selected.
    To open up a note you've already created, double tap on it. You'll find the New Note button in the bottom-right corner regardless of whether you're in a folder. Double tap it and the note creation screen will appear. Near the top left, you'll find buttons to "add people" who can view and write in the note. You'll find a Share button letting you send the note via email or share it in other ways. To the left of the edit field at the centre, you'll find a constantly updated time stamp. There's an edit field in the centre of the creation screen. That's all you'll need for creating a basic note. Type in the information or dictate it using the Dictate button that appears on the virtual keyboard. You can also start or stop dictation while in the edit field with a two finger double tap. While you're in the edit field and in editing mode, a Done button is just to the left of the edit field next to the time stamp near the top. You'll need to exit the edit field to move to any other controls on the screen. Use the rotor to move within your note and edit text.
    Past the edit field, you'll find several other buttons that take you beyond basic notes. For instance, there's a button to "add table" so you can create a table of rows, columns, etc. There are other buttons letting you choose different text styles, make your note a checklist of items, and presuming you have some vision, use drawing and handwriting tools. All of this is optional. If you prefer, you can use a Hide Toolbar button to tuck these options past the edit field out of your way.
    Notes can have headings. You can turn a line of text into a heading by selecting it and then using the rotor or the format button. An option to create a heading will be present. Once created, you can then double tap on the heading to hide or reveal the text beneath it down to the next heading. This lets you quickly move through large notes containing many sections. In some situations, this could be preferable to having many notes.
    The Notes app received an upgrade in iOS15. Users of this or a more recent version of the operating system will be able to easily mention people in a note. These people will be provided access to the note, which lets them read it or edit and change the contents if the note is shared. Simply type an at sign before the name of the person in order to "mention" them. Also, it is now possible to organize notes by hashtags. You can tag a note with as many hashtags as you wish. Enter the hashtag or number sign in front of a keyword or a string of characters which makes sense. It will become a hashtag when you hit the space bar. Hashtags should be on their own separate lines. A tag browser lets you look at any notes with a desired tag in them, making for an easy way to keep all your notes organized and connected.
    Let's look at a personal example. I've had an idea for what might end up being a novel or roleplaying game campaign. It's called The Paradigm Crucible. That's a lot of characters to type in whenever I have an idea relevant to this project. I've therefore created a hashtag using a hash or number sign followed by the characters p, a, r and c. I simply had to create a note which included this hashtag. Hashtags can be anywhere in a note, but I tend to prefer them at the bottom. I may have ideas for characters, plots, scenes, places, etc related to this project. I can create additional hashtags such as char for character ideas, plot for plot ideas, etc. As long as I remember to include appropriate hashtags in my notes, they can be grouped together when I need them to be.
    Hashtags combine wonderfully with smart folders. When you create a new folder, you'll find an option to make it a "smart" folder. These folders will automatically include any notes which meet the criteria you desire. For instance, you might want a smart folder to contain any notes which have specific hashtags. Building on my previous example, I could create a smart folder which contains any notes with the "parc" hashtag. There are already dozens of notes, and I may eventually have hundreds. Also, there will likely be situations when ideas I have for this project are more suitable for another. Because I have the "char" hashtag in any character related notes, this isn't a problem. I could create a smart folder which includes all character related ideas in addition to one which includes both the "parc" and "char" hashtags.
    Using smart folders doesn't ever duplicate notes. There's just one copy which is included in smart folders whenever that's appropriate. The folders will automatically keep updating as you create notes, add or remove hashtags, etc. Smart folders need not be centred on hashtags at all. There are other choices for filtering criteria. You can use date ranges, keywords, whether notes have attachments such as files, whether notes are checklists, and other filtering criteria.
    Quicknotes are another relatively recent addition. The idea behind quicknotes is that they can be created from anywhere quickly without having to go into the Notes app. Once invoked, a creation screen appears with the edit field ready and waiting for input. You can rapidly enter information such as a phone number or other details. Then, you can save the note and be right back in the app you were previously in. If you decide you don't need the information, you can cancel the screen and nothing will be created.
    Quicknotes are kept in a special folder which is shared between any devices using the same Apple account by default. A quicknote created on one device will instantly be available on an iPad or Mac computer. When these notes are created, the system is aware of your context and will suggest links or files to add to the quicknote based on what you were doing before creating the quicknote. Perhaps, you were browsing the web using Safari. A suggestion to add a link to the page you are on would be present. A simple double tap on the "add" button would add a link to the quicknote allowing easy return to the resource.
    There is nothing else intrinsically different about quicknotes. Upon being moved out of the quicknotes folder and into the default notes folder or any other, they become regular notes. Periodically, you could move any quicknotes which have become more important into other folders. Even left in the quicknotes folder, hashtags, links and smart folders will still include these notes unless otherwise indicated by an exclusion filter you create when making the smart folder.
    I have an action button on my iPhone 16 Pro. By going into the settings for the action button, choosing "controls" from the slider of choices, and then selecting the "quicknote control" from the variety of options, I have a ready means of quickly summoning a quicknote creation screen. I could then simply do a magic tap, which is a two finger double tap, and start dictating the information. Then, after a second magic tap to stop dictation, I would simply touch near the top left of the screen and flick right until I found the save button. A single finger double tap on this would complete the process.
    On my iPhone 15, I have no action button. However, I can add the quicknote control to my control panel. This process involves going into the control panel, flicking down and going into the "edit controls" mode, and using the "add control" button at the bottom right of the screen. Once this is double tapped, you can flick through the choices until you come to "quicknote control". After it is added, you can drag and drop the control into an easy place to get to when the control panel is summoned. I have it near the left end of the controls, next to the "notes" control. This way, I can also quickly get into the Notes app from wherever I happen to be.
    The ability to link notes to one another is a feature often found in third party notes apps, which has now been added to Apple's own Notes app. It further increases the ability to quickly move between notes. By typing two greater than signs in a note, you will summon a list of notes which you have modified recently. If you remember the title of a note, you can type it immediately after the greater than signs. It's usually quicker just to use the list of most recent modified notes which appears. The title of a note is the first line of the body if you've set notes not to start with titles. You can find the list by touching near the middle of the screen. Flick left and right through the choices and double tap on what you want. This will add a link to the note you're in, and add a reciprocal link leading to your current note from the one you want the link to go to. This link will update automatically to reflect any change you subsequently make to the title or very first line of either note. As with hashtags, notes can have more than one such link in them. Over time, you might end up in a situation with many different ideas and pieces of related information linked together in this way. These links will allow quick access to connected notes.
    Some people have used these organizational tools to construct elaborate personal knowledge keeping systems. An example of such a system can be learned about by visiting:

Apple's Office and Creativity Suite:
Back when iPhones were new, these apps used to cost money. However, for years now, anyone who owns an iOS device is entitled to download and use Apple's creativity and office apps for free. Similar to Microsoft's Office suite that now requires you to pay a subscription, Apple has made a collection of apps to help people get regular office work done on their mobile devices. As with other apps produced by Apple, accessibility support has been included right from the first. These apps are fully useable with VoiceOver and work well with other accessibility tools. As the capabilities of VoiceOver have expanded, Apple's developers have been quick to add techniques to ease the process of creation and editing. Much of this depends on your comfort with using the VoiceOver rotor. There are now custom rotors with various important options present in each of Apple's suite of office apps. Also, check the "edit" and "actions" rotors for extra options which may not be found in other apps. Content created with them can be exported to other formats, such as Microsoft Word or Excel. Anything created with these apps is automatically stored in your Cloud, so you never need to worry about losing your work.
    This collection of apps was designed to be useful to everyone from hobbyists to professionals. They offer a very extensive set of features and are relatively large apps, weighing in at around the 400 megabyte range. Having them come preinstalled would, therefore, take up 3 or 4 GB in total, which is a significant amount of storage on older devices with lower capacity. Hence, the need to visit the app store and download the ones you actually want to use. Each app comes with plenty of available documentation to help you make the most of the capabilities offered. As of 2025, this collection includes:
Numbers
The Numbers app lets you create and edit spreadsheets. These can be made from scratch with formulas and visual elements, all made totally accessible to blind users. You can import Excel spreadsheets and work with them in Numbers. Once finished, you can send the results to others in many different formats. It is also possible to work collaboratively with others using Numbers. Provided you know how to work with spreadsheets, you'll find it possible to do that work accessibly on your iOS device.
    I've never been fond of spreadsheets, nor very capable with them. However, I've been able to move around and change numbers on an invoice sheet without difficulty. The rotor is an absolute must here. You need to turn it to "Rows" to then be able to move up or down while keeping in the same column. When editing the contents of a cell, set the rotor to Characters or Words in order to move within that cell and not jump accidentally to another. It wants to default to the Rows or Actions setting, so caution is needed here. Remember to double tap on a cell to enter Edit mode. I would say that being competent and comfortable with the voiceOver rotor is essential to use the app productively. There's definitely a learning curve to making effective use of the Numbers app, but it's quite possible to deal with spreadsheets on iOS devices.
    You can access help from within the app. However, this requires you to actually open a spreadsheet. You can then make use of the "more" button, which brings up a menu which contains the "settings" button. Double tap this and proceed in that menu to the "Numbers help" button. There, you'll find the user guide to Numbers and the suggestion to download it in the Books app. The guide can be obtained freely as an Apple book. There's also a support site for users of the Numbers app. It can be found at:
    https://support.apple.com/en-ca/numbers
Pages:
The Pages app is Apple's answer to Microsoft Word. It allows you to do word processing on your iOS device. It has templates for various kinds of documents to help you format things correctly. As of July 2019, this includes templates for writing books in English. Now, people who intend to publish a book in the Apple Books store can do so using the Pages app to create and publish the book. You can work collaboratively, tracking any changes made to documents. It is also possible to export documents to other formats such as Microsoft Word if necessary.
    Pages makes heavy use of templates designed for different kinds of documents. The idea is that these templates will largely take care of the formatting for you, thereby letting you concentrate on what you're writing. You choose a template when you create a new document in Pages, but you don't have to do that if you're working on a pre-existing document, such as a text file stored in your Cloud. Once you've picked the proper template, you would essentially fill it in like a form in order to create your document. You can flick left and right through choices in menus. The rotor gives you easy access to an impressive array of editing actions. While in a document, all the usual editing tools and rotor actions are available. Spellchecking is done through the Misspelled Words rotor option, as in other areas in iOS where editing text is possible.
    Each page in a document is its own edit field. This makes it possible to move quickly through your document by flicking left or right to the necessary page and then double tapping it to enter the edit field. It is, however, also possible to scroll through the document while in the edit field with traditional three finger swipes. The Pages app is brimming over with features that many people will simply never need. However, they are kept out of your way. If you need options for document, page or paragraph formatting, you'll find them through the edit rotor or by using buttons found outside the document canvas. The "more", "insert object", and "format" buttons let you access a wide range of options. If something doesn't present itself in the edit rotor, that is where I would go first in search of a desired option. The writing tools supported by Apple Intelligence are available. This adds many new capabilities, discussed fully in the section on Siri and Apple Intelligence. Templates will handle a lot of the formatting work for you, presuming you like how they operate. I have no idea how easy it would be to modify an existing template or create your own without sight.
    Like other apps in Apple's creativity suite, Pages has a reading mode which presents your document in a way that makes it as easy to read as possible on the device you're using. This may be of some help to people with low vision. There is also a presentation mode. The "Share" button presents all kinds of options for exporting your documents into other formats a well as options to distribute the document by message or mail, and save it to any cloud services you may want. Blind people may find the reading or presentation modes useful as a way of easily moving through a document if their only intention is to read it. I haven't found it useful in terms of editing a document. You need to exit the reading mode with a magic tap. That's a two finger double tap. This will make editing the document possible.
    As with Numbers, there is help available. It comes in the form of a user manual in Apple Books. You can also access help from within the app, similarly to how to get there in Numbers. Open a document, double tap on "More", and flick right until you reach "Help with Pages". You can reach Apple's support site for Pages at:
    https://support.apple.com/pages
Keynote:
This is Apple's presentation software. It lets you create and give presentations using your iOS device. You can label slides, use images and photos, and do lots of other things to add zip to presentations. I have never needed to create the kind of formal presentation that Keynote was built to help achieve. In this case, then, I'm afraid you're on your own. Check the AppleVis site and elsewhere online for guides, tips, and advice from blind people who have made use of this tool.
Other Creativity Offerings from Apple:
For as long as I can remember, Apple has been known as the company that supports artists and creative types. They have produced several apps to further this objective. With its increased capability as of iOS 13, the Photos app could certainly be regarded as one such app. It is also worth pointing out here that the Notes app includes the capability to sketch drawings, just like a sighted person would on a notepad. It is also possible to use handwriting in place of a keyboard anywhere in iOS where text can be entered. These capabilities are unlikely to be of much use to blind people. However, the iMovie app as well as an app called Garage Band have successfully been used by blind people to create videos and music. Having absolutely no aptitude or experience with either of these things, I leave it to interested readers to figure out how to work them. I can say that both apps are built with accessibility in mind. My wife Sara, being musically inclined, has briefly tinkered with GarageBand, but has yet to use it for serious creation.
    The Freeform app is a more recent addition. It was built to allow for visual brainstorming and mind mapping. Users can create boards which have an infinite canvas to put sticky notes, shapes, text boxes, media and other elements on. These elements can be moved around and connections can be made between them. VoiceOver makes it possible to put objects on a board and make some use of this app. However, the accessibility is incomplete, and it's difficult to really get a sense of where objects are on the canvas. There's also no way to get any sort of described overview of what's on a board. There is a setting in "Settings", "Apps", "Freeform", which will overlay a grid onto the canvas. This provides helpful coordinates which make it possible to get a sense of the relative position of elements. A blind user could, for instance, explore and read the notes and text boxes on a board being shared among colleagues. Collaboration and sharing boards are both possible with the Freeform app.
    It wouldn't entirely surprise me if Apple improved the accessibility of this app suddenly. A similar third-party app called MindNode is described later in this section which handles this aspect of mind mapping far better at present.
Third-Party Apps Helpful to Writers:
Writing is my main productive activity. Here, I'm in territory where I feel I can speak with some experience, having tried out many apps devised to help with the writing process. We'll take a close look at my writing app of choice, as well as a collection of other apps that aid me in my projects.
The Ulysses Writing App in Depth:
This app won an Apple design award at the WWDC, a conference for app developers. Shortly after this, the app was made accessible using VoiceOver. Ulysses is designed to be a writing tool that scales from short documents through to novels. Simplicity and no clutter are key design principles. Writers can focus on actual writing. Using Markdown language to insert formatting instructions removes the need for toolbars and other things that clutter and distract writers using other word processors. Key features include a revision mode which contains grammar checking powered by artificial intelligence. There's also the ability to set writing goals, keep your writing nicely organized, and much more. Everything you write is instantly backed up to iCloud, so there's no need to worry about saving progress. Recent improvements now include the ability to automatically create a table of contents in exported documents. This third edition of my book is the first to be created exclusively using the Ulysses app.
    This app rewards mastery of the rotor as well as exploration of the screen. Accessibility is good in all areas, including goal setting. The developers are very responsive to suggestions and do their best to address problems. They are compensated for this attentiveness and continued development of the app through a subscription that people pay to use the app. This economic model allows for more steady and thoughtful improvements to the app, rather than the constant attempt to attract new sales by introducing new and sometimes ill-considered features. As a result, it has become my favourite writing app. I feel that I'm getting my money's worth when it comes to development of features and the overall security that comes from app developers having a steady income. I need not worry that my favourite writing tool will suddenly be abandoned due to unsustainable economics.
    The developers of Ulysses have taken steps to ensure that changes are tested for accessibility. They welcome blind testers and take other measures to try to avoid any difficulties. This hasn't always been the case. It took over two months before an earlier issue resulting in crippling sluggishness was resolved. It always pays to have a backup plan in case your favourite app for an essential purpose suffers similar issues or degradations in accessibility. I ended up exporting my worksheet by sheet into an app called Scrivener to continue working. Keeping track of which parts were most up to date in which app became a major problem. However, this painful stretch was the first crisis of this kind that I've experienced with Ulysses. It worked splendidly well for most of the past five years as I've worked on this guide.
    A very helpful special revision mode is available. This uses artificial intelligence to assist writers in editing their work. This mode can check for grammatical and other errors and suggest changes. Very helpful and particularly useful for people using older iPhones which can't take advantage of Apple Intelligence. The system is very accessible.
    A "sheet" is what this app calls a document. You don't need to give a sheet a title. A single sheet can contain as much text as you want it to. There are no imposed size limits. Sheets can be put into groups that can be organized in many different ways. For instance, each major section of my guide to iOS is a sheet. I can duplicate, delete, export, or change the order of these sheets easily at any time. I can cut, copy, and paste text into sheets. Also, I can attach writing goals, notes, and keywords to sheets. Groups of related sheets can be exported as a single document. If I wish, I can make sheets into "material" as in research material. Sheets with this designation won't be included in the word count or group export, but are handy in the same group as your writing is for consulting. It is ideal for creating books. This is a very flexible and powerful organizational system. Groups can have goals assigned to them. Groups can be sorted in the best way for their specific contents. My group of AMI Audio files is organized by date, while the group of sheets comprising the guide I'm writing is organized manually. This lets me work on whichever section I might want to without changing the order of the sections. Should I actually wish to change their order, doing so is a simple matter, akin to rearranging items in the VoiceOver rotor settings.
    There are instructions and help available in the app and on the developer's website, www.ulyssesapp.com. The instructions are in special groups of sheets found in the main library. You'll be going into the editor to read any sheets that interest you. The first group of instruction sheets is called "First Steps". Double tap on this to enter the group of sheets. Flick right until you pass the First Steps heading, and you'll be at the first sheet, which is "Quick Overview". Double tap on a sheet to open it. Flick right until you hear instructions being read. Once this happens, you can simply leave it to read the full sheet of information. No action is necessary. When finished, hit the Back button at the top left of the screen and proceed to find the next sheet or group you want to look at. The rotor is your friend. Set it to move by Character, Word, etc., and to select text for sharing or movement. Once a sheet is opened, it fills the majority of the screen. There's a search option outside of the text field.
    The heart of Ulysses is the editor. Once you open a sheet, you're viewing it in the editor, but not able to write or change the contents. From this external view, you can set goals, change editor settings, and export the sheet if you wish. Buttons to do all these things are found at the top of the screen, to the right of the Back button. These have recently been drastically changed to remove clutter. You'll find a "new sheet" button which creates a new sheet in the current group. Next to it, there is a "more" button which accesses a range of features including revision mode, other editing tools, and export options to share and publish your work.
    Next comes the text field. To start writing, double tap on the text field. Now, when you move onto the text field, it will say "is editing". This remains the case even if you move off the text field to use the onscreen keyboard. To leave this writing mode, double tap the Dismiss Keyboard button, which is one move to the right of the text field. Think of it like capping your pen. If you're using a Bluetooth keyboard, the escape key will perform the function of getting you out of editing mode. The app takes advantage of the autocorrect and spellcheck facilities built into iOS. These are useable but can be annoying. To minimize this, I have autocorrect turned off and simply use spellcheck. It will tell you if the word you move onto is spelled wrong. The Misspelled Words rotor selection makes the spellchecking process a breeze with VoiceOver. Navigate through the document using the rotor, setting it to Character, Word, or Line as desired. The vertical bar is available at the right of the screen. For substantial moves through a longer sheet, use that or three finger swipes up or down to go forward and backward. Use the rotor to Select, Cut, Copy, and Paste text.
    Move past the edit field while you're still in editing mode, and you'll find a Dismiss Keyboard button, a Search button, and a sort of toolbar that contains Undo/Redo, Paragraph Tags, Inline Tags, Special Characters, and Left/Right buttons. The "tags" buttons give you access to the Markdown language commands you'll use while writing if you can't memorize them. You don't have to use this toolbar equivalent at all. I never do, but it's there if needed. I recommend learning the Markdown XL commands and simply typing them in when required. Find them in the Markdown XL group of introduction files. This is immediately past the First Steps group.
    When out of the text field, you'll find that flicking past the text field gets you to the dashboard, as well as a navigation button. The dashboard is where you'll find progress status, tools to set and adjust goals, add keywords, and much more. To access the full details about your document plus add or change goals, double tap on the progress indicator on the dashboard. This takes you to an area with statistics such as word and character count, how long it takes to read your document, etc. Here is where you can add and manage goals for the particular sheet you're focussing on. There are buttons related to goal setting. For instance, you can specify any number of words to reach or as a maximum. There are quite a wide range of goals, as well as the ability to set deadlines to help keep you organized. The ability to attach notes to sheets lets you keep information handy, which is useful for creating your document, but they won't be included when the document is exported.
    Ulysses continues to improve in steady and thoughtful ways. The addition of the dashboard and navigation tools plus the revision mode are proving very helpful and have reduced clutter. Elements are only present when required, making for a very clean writing environment. One of the new features recently added is the ability to generate a table of contents which will be put in when you export a group of sheets as a document. This may very well eliminate my need to use Pages when creating this ebook. Combined with VoiceOver's text editing controls and the built-in dictionary and thesaurus offered by Apple, writers have a lot of power in their pockets. The grammatical advice built into the revision mode complements these capabilities wonderfully at no charge beyond the subscription cost. Ulysses also supports the use of Apple Intelligence writing tools provided your iPhone supports Apple Intelligence.
    If you're wanting to write a blog, Ulysses supports direct publishing of postings to a number of different free and commercial blog platforms.
Other Notable Alternatives
Many people object to the thought of paying a subscription to keep using a word processor. This is quite understandable. It comes down to how much you value an app's ongoing, stable development and presence. If the continued expense or other factors dissuade you from using Ulysses, you have an ever-growing number of apps built for writers to choose from. It seems only fair to briefly go over some of these choices. All of these are available in the app store as of December 2024. Any app covered here works well enough with VoiceOver to be used productively. In fact, had VoiceOver been as far along as it was when I first turned to Ulysses, I may well never have gone through the trouble of exploration and simply stuck to using Apple's freely available Pages app. However, back in those earlier days, VoiceOver simply wasn't up to the task.
    Some apps are built for specific kinds of writing. The Essayist app was designed to help you write and properly format academic essays. It handles four styles including APA, MLA, Chicago and Harvard. Designed for sighted people, but with accessibility a high priority, this app works with VoiceOver. The app won't write your essays for you, but it will automatethings like citing references properly. I would have pounced on something like this if it had been available when I did my time at university. There is a subscription cost for more professional features, but you can try the app for free to decide if it meets your needs.
    The closest competition to Ulysses is an app called Scrivener. Developed by Literature & Latte, this very popular and accessible word-processing app allows you to create writing projects and organize any related content and research material into the same project binder. You then have everything you need ready for use and in the same space. It is easy to move between separate sections of a project binder. One section is for your draft. Another separate section is where you would put notes and research required for your project, but not intended to be part of what's published. Similar to Ulysses, sheets in your binder can be of any size and may be reordered and organized with ease. This app can be yours for a one-time fee of around $20.
    At a little over $10, the iA Writer offers an even cheaper alternative. It has capabilities helpful to programmers, such as the ability to handle regular expressions when doing search and replace. It also offers guidance for writers regarding English syntax. For instance, if you are guilty of run-on sentences or using too many adverbs, this app might be very helpful.
    The Google suite of productivity apps are all quite accessible for iOS devices. This includes Google Docs. I have yet to try this writing tool. However, educational institutions quite often make use of Google Docs and other apps produced by Google. The apps are available free of charge. If you have a Google account and use other Google services, you should take this app for a spin before paying for an app. This presumes that you're alright with Google's privacy and data collection policies. I've never heard of a case where people were disadvantaged in any way because of data collected through use of any of Google's many data-driven apps, be they for productivity or otherwise. However, companies like Google provide apps and services with motives besides simply adding to the average person's tool set, so people should be aware of what they agree to.
    People who write blogs have plenty of apps designed to make publishing their posts easier. I use the Blogger platform for my personal blog and will typically write my posts in Ulysses. I will then simply export the entry as a plain text document into my clipboard and paste it into my blog. Ulysses directly supports WordPress and a few other blog hosting options, allowing for direct publication into your blog. For professional bloggers wanting the best possible appearance, there are numerous apps which are more especially designed for blogging. Before moving all my writing to Ulysses, I was particularly fond of an app called Byword. It can publish my entry directly into my blog with minimal fuss. I previously used an app called BlogTouch Pro, but eventually came to prefer the simplicity and better accessibility offered by Byword. Before looking for a specialty app, be certain that you've checked for blog-related options in the writing app you currently prefer. Also, some popular blog and website hosting services have their own apps that may prove accessible. WordPress comes to mind here.
Apps for Better Note-taking:
There are many choices of apps designed specifically for certain tasks. Word processors like Pages and Ulysses are not ideal for quickly taking notes, especially when on the move. I find it very helpful to have my notes in a completely separate app from the rest of my writing. This way, I can simply switch between apps and not lose my place in what I'm working on to check or create notes. A four finger swipe to the left or right switches you easily between apps.
    Recently, Apple has taken major strides in developing its Notes app into something which truly meets the needs of people in need of organized notes and raises the bar for third-party note related apps. Before you seek third-party alternatives, try this app first, since it's already included by Apple.
    A whole group of apps focuses more on note-taking and keeping track of ideas. They offer a variety of features which go beyond what the Notes app included with iOS makes available.
    A recent discovery in this area which is cross-platform and made to be accessible is called Joplin. It's an open-source alternative for keeping and creating notes, reminders and todos. These can be kept in notebooks, organized by tags, and have multimedia elements like transcribed speech, attached documents, etc. It seems like a very good one-stop information centre for people wanting access to their notes, reminders and todos on other systems as well as on your iOS device.
    One very popular and accessible app in this category is called Bear. It focusses on capturing and organizing notes or ideas. Rather than taking the time to keep notes organized in folders or separate notebooks like some apps, Bear takes a different approach. It makes use of tags which you create inside a note. These use the number sign or hash, similar to the hashtags found on social media. Any words in a tag will allow the app to show all related notes with the same tag. Notes can have as many tags as necessary, making it easy to quickly indicate how ideas are related to others.
    The notes you create can be tagged, chained together, and manipulated in various ways. This includes publishing them in multiple formats. If you want to sync your notes between devices and publish in several formats, a subscription of around $1.99 per month is asked. This removes restricted features and supports the app's continued development.
    A somewhat more traditional approach is taken by a wonderfully accessible app called Notebooks10. This app uses a more tried and true structure of different notebooks for different topics. However, it can store more than just notes. You can put all kind of other files in a notebook. Also, there is a way to write text within a note and then quickly send it away to become its own note, which is placed in an inbox to be sorted later. This takes care of those occasions when you need to jot down a phone number or other unrelated information without losing your place in a current note.
    Have you ever just needed to instantly write down an idea? Another app called Drafts happily solves that problem by dumping you instantly into an edit field whenever you open it. Much more convenient for quick notes. Drafts also makes it easy to send any written notes to other apps or people. Billed as "the app where text begins", it incorporates a lot of automation ideas which are designed to keep information organized and speed up your workflow.
    An app called Noted developed by Digital Workroom LTD. Combines recording audio with the ability to timestamp written notes. This could be just the thing for students or people needing to record presentations. You can use up to five notes free to test the app out. However, to unlock the full features, you'll need to pay for a monthly or yearly subscription.
    Another app called Allegory, developed by Shihab Mehboob, offers a one-stop app for notes and creative inspirations. There are facilities for art creation as well as written notes. Documents and audio recordings can also be added. Everything can be searched for using natural language. Terms like "yesterday" or "last week" can help you track down things you forgot the name of. With so many facilities, this app could be very useful to people with no or low vision. The developer is eager for any feedback regarding the app, including accessibility issues.
    For people with many thoughts and ideas to keep organized, perhaps a mind-mapping app could help you. One that is very accessible to VoiceOver users is called MindNode. Be certain that you get the latest version of this app. In early 2022, this is MindNode version 2021.4. Even if you can't see the lines connecting the nodes, which are your ideas, VoiceOver informs you of such connections. You can keep ideas organized by how they are associated or connected with each other. For instance, I could keep a mind map of ideas for a novel with events, characters, and plot points connected to each other. It's easy to go through and change such connections later as your thinking changes. A very extensive approach to keeping track of ideas for ongoing endeavours.
    Users who have low vision may be able to actually see how their thoughts connect. This can apparently be very helpful for assignments and larger personal projects. MindNode is free to download and try for fourteen days. After that, you'll still be able to view what you created, but must unlock the app by subscribing to a monthly or yearly MindNode Plus subscription. Should you ever need to cancel, you can still use the features which were developed prior to when you cancelled. I've heard that approaches such as that offered by MindNode are very useful for people with ADHD or other learning difficulties in terms of brainstorming and organizing ideas. You can learn more about the app by visiting:
    https://www.mindnode.com/
    All of these apps are now basically competing with Apple, who has incorporated many of the features once exclusive to a particular app. The Notes app is, for instance, able to record and transcribe audio from within a note. A recent addition to iOS was the Freeform app, which allows for similar mental mapping and brainstorming as MindNode. I don't make any use of either app. However, after examining each one, I would have to give the accessibility edge to MindNode when used with VoiceOver. It seems easier to understand and move around your infinite canvas in MindNode. However, Apple might improve this sort of thing at any time, so I'd recommend trying Freeform first in case it meets your particular needs before investing in MindNode.
    All of the apps sited above are still being updated as their developers work to keep them desirable and a step ahead of Apple, raising the bar sharply over the past four or five years.
Time and Task Management Apps:
To keep projects on track, I have used many different apps. For people who use Microsoft's Outlook and Office apps on other platforms, the Microsoft To Do app may prove especially welcome and useful. You need a Microsoft account, but anybody who uses Skype will already have one of those. If not, you can create one for free. Even on its own, Microsoft To Do is an exceptionally accessible and free task management app with a rich set of features.
    For larger ongoing work and personal projects, Things 3, developed by Cultured Code, is a good accessible candidate. It is costly at around $13.99 Canadian, but if you need to organize a hectic life, it may well be worth getting. You can import reminders from other apps, organize projects and to-dos into groups based on areas of responsibility, and set up recurring events. Quite a lot of organizational power is packed into the app. It integrates with Siri and with your calendar and reminders. You can do everything with VoiceOver, as extensive work has been done to make this app very accessible.
    While you're going at a full clip, it may be inconvenient to stop and check the clock to find the time. There are numerous accessible apps that help with keeping track of and managing time. The Westminster Chimes Full app was my usual choice for this before I got an Apple Watch, which solves the problem very nicely with taps on my wrist. Westminster Chimes Full alerts me to the passage of time at regular intervals via distinctive well-known patterns of clock chimes, making it unnecessary for me to interrupt my work to check the clock on the status bar. It has several options including styles of chimes as well as spoken time updates. The introduction of iOS 15 caused a bit of a furor when the app no longer worked due to updates to how notes are handled in iOS. However, this problem has now long since been addressed. People who don't have an Apple Watch will find it a useful tool in their timekeeping arsenal.
    Working from home has exposed many of us to endless temptations to do just about anything but actual work. Focus modes and other tools in iOS can be extremely helpful. However, another approach is a simple work timer. An app called Focused Work fills the bill quite nicely with plenty of features to control the period of work and break time, plus whether anything is restricted while you should be working. The timer tics in the background and gives reminders via notifications as you're working. It is fully accessible with Voiceover. When you reach a new stage in the timer, a ding sounds followed by a notification about the stage being entered. The volume of the tics can be set to that it serves as a gentle reminder to keep working rather than being a distraction. Learn more by going to:

    For a much more basic approach to the Pomodoro work time management technique, check out an app called Pommie. You'll find a much less complex solution which still offers abilities such as creating different profiles for different kinds of work, adjusting the length of timer stages, etc. Learn more about this app by going to:

Structured:
Developed by Unorderly GMBH, this is an excellent accessible alternative calendar, habit tracker and time manager for people who need their days more structured. It is advertised as being very helpful for people with ADHd or other mental conditions which make ordinary calendars less useful. It is possible to use a more limited set of features for free, but you can subscribe or pay for a lifetime Structured Pro subscription. This allows for creating recurring events, using AI to natrally parse notes and events, and synchronize information between various calendars.
    Everything is integrated automatically into a schedule which shows how your day breaks down in detail. This includes blocks of time between events. The ap has things like a focus timer to keep you on track. You can switch between a day, week or month view and easily rearrange events.
Fantastical:
I first heard of Fantastical through online acquaintances I've made over the years. I wasn't much interested at the time and took no immediate action. However, it seemed to keep coming up in reviews of other apps and in conversation. Comments were mostly always favourable. I did quite well with the calendar and reminders apps that came with iOS. However, when working on this guide, I thought I should get it and see how good an example it would make of an alternative and better accessible approach to personal life organization. For at least five years, it was one of my most valued apps. Thanks to improvements made in the Apple calendar for iOS 17 and 18, I no longer have need of this app. A major draw was how it combined reminders and calendar into one place, letting you see all of your due dates. Now that the Apple calendar does this, and also handles online meeting appointments better than it once did, Fantastical is no longer necessary for me. However, if you tend to schedule a lot of events, the facilities it offers for keeping track of invitation status and scheduling alternatives might make the app worth its subscription price.
    The app developers are very responsive to ideas and/or accessibility issues. My no longer using the app is by no means due to a degradation in its quality or accessibility. People who are running businesses or are responsible for event planning should definitely give this app a try. This app is made by Flexibits. It is free to download and try. However, it now requires a subscription to unlock its full features.
    To dictate an event, you must first use the New Event button. Once you're in the edit field, find the Dictate button on the virtual keyboard on your iOS device to the left of the spacebar. If you're using a Bluetooth keyboard and want to dictate an event, you need to deactivate that keyboard, so the virtual one pops up on your iOS device. The virtual keyboard is only present once you've entered an edit field. Fantastical doesn't replace Siri, so holding down the Home button or saying "hey Siri" will still behave as always. This lets you still use Siri when you're hurrying through your day. However, if you can get into the habit of going into the Fantastical app and using its New Event button instead, you gain the advantage to speak or type very naturally about the event or reminder and have Fantastical understand you perfectly and do the right thing. Once you're certain you've been properly understood, find the Add button near the top left of the screen and double tap it to complete the operation.
    Fantastical has all the control buttons at the top of the screen. Below is the "day ticker" that displays days with events or reminders. You can choose whether empty days are shown or not. Each day starts with a heading, so turn the rotor to headings to scroll quickly through days. You can scroll infinitely back or forward. A two-finger swipe downward while on the top of the day ticker will transform it into a month calendar. You can then turn the rotor to Vertical Navigation to examine days and weeks, flicking up or down through weeks and left or right through days. Use a three-finger swipe left or right, moving back and forth through months. On the day ticker, flick right to go over each event or reminder within a day. Flick down when on an event or reminder to access a context menu, allowing you to select the default More action, or delete it. Double tap on your choice to execute it, or flick right or left to leave the menu.
    Creating events is very intuitive with Fantastical. The New Event button is to the right of the Go to Today button. Double tap it and you'll be in an edit field. Type or dictate your event in sentence form. If it's repeating, you need to be specific. For example, it doesn't automatically know that birthdays happen every year, so you have to say "Michael's birthday is on October 29th each year". It will then fill in all the fields for you. If you're happy with the result, flick right to get to the Add button. You can also edit details to get exactly the event or reminder you want. If you want a reminder rather than an event, include the words "reminder", "to-do", or "task" in the sentence.
    The buttons at the top are Settings, Go to Today, and New Event. There are also buttons allowing you to sort and filter what is displayed by "title", "location", and "invitees". All of these buttons will always be displayed at the top of the screen, starting with Settings at the top left. It can be very useful to have any due dates and tasks with deadlines be seen along with the rest of your calendar. The Fantastical 3 app serves as a wonderful calendar that also integrates reminders, making it easier to keep track of when things are due in context with other life events. Fantastical 3 is fully accessible with VoiceOver, and the developer is eager for any suggestions. The app is now a subscription service, charging around $3.40 per month with an annual subscription discount.
    This is just the tip of the iceberg. There are many other choices in this category of apps. I've heard good things about OmniFocus, developed by Omni Group. There are also apps that combine notes with calendar facilities. Moleskine has made its pair of note and calendar apps, Actions and Timepage, accessible for use by blind people. They are a subscription service, so you'll want to check the pricing and use the free trial offered by these apps to see if they're a good fit for you. The productivity category of the iOS app directory on AppleVis has many other apps that have been found to be accessible to a greater or lesser degree.
Crunching the Numbers:
Another discovery which ha stood the test of time very well is called PCalc, developed by TLA Systems LTD. It is a powerful and flexible calculator that has been in development for twenty-five years, appearing originally on Mac computers. The iOS incarnation draws on that core and takes advantage of iOS features, including accessibility support. You can try the basic calculator for free and then add sets of capabilities as desired through in-app purchases of scientific, engineering, and accounting packs, among others. For $13.99, you can buy the full calculator outright. Get the PCalc Lite app to try it for free and save money by adding only the feature packs you want. The developer is eager to hear about and fix any accessibility issues encountered.
    Yet another alternative calculator called Desmos is specially designed for students. It is a graphing calculator and even the graphs are accessible to blind students thanks to auditory representation.
    The only thing these calculators don't do is show the steps needed to reach their conclusions. Students will still actually have to "do the math". These more powerful calculators will, however, make it easier to check their answers. Outside the world of academia, where quick results are what matters, these calculators will serve people well in everyday work and life.
Music and Audio Recording and Creation:
Your iOS device can serve as an excellent and fully accessible audio recorder. The microphones built into iOS devices are very capable and optimized for capturing the voices of people. This helps with clear communications between people, as well as in the recognition of vocal dictation or commands given to Siri. For more professional recording, external microphones that connect via Bluetooth or directly via Lightning or USB-C cable are available. There are a whole range of apps for producing good recordings for lectures, producing podcasts, editing sound, and creating music. Many of these apps are fully accessible to blind people.
    For basic recording, Apple provides the Voice Memos app that comes as part of iOS itself. For details on how to use this app, please refer to the Lifestyle Apps section earlier in this guide.
    In the rest of this section, we'll examine three of the most popular accessible recording apps. Each of them is built with a somewhat different primary purpose and design. In each case, the app developers have demonstrated a commitment to making their apps as accessible and easy to use as possible with VoiceOver. However, there may be times when accessibility won't be up to the usual mark due to changes to iOS or other circumstances. Sometimes, in the race to stay competitive, accessibility has been overlooked, resulting in a splendidly accessible app becoming suddenly useless until problems are addressed.
Ferrite Recording Studio
Living up to its name, this app provides a full suite of audio editing and recording capabilities. Projects can involve multiple tracks and audio clips. There's definitely a learning curve here. However, in exchange for that effort, you get a compelling and versatile recording environment. It's perfectly possible to use it as a simple recorder as well. You don't need to master every aspect before you can put it to good use. However, a little learning can go a long way. There are ways to import audio such as sound effects or music beds, positioning and merging everything as needed.
    Ferrite is free to download. This lets you try things out and make recordings up to an hour long. If you want to remove the one-hour limitation and unlock the advanced features, his app has to offer, purchase the upgrade suitable to your purposes. Unlocking everything costs under $30 Canadian and gives you as powerful an audio workshop in your pocket or bag as you're ever likely to need.
    Using VoiceOver, blind people can put all of this capability to use. There are special rotor options for choosing among editing tools and options. VoiceOver can read where the play head and selected audio is, allowing you to cut, paste, trim, and craft your audio creation with precision. Ferrite stores everything in its own library on your device. Everything is part of one or more projects. These projects can have multiple tracks and be as large as your device has room for. Projects can also be archived to other external storage, including iCloud and many other options.
    I have used Ferrite to do some fairly straightforward recording and make basic edits. It would certainly meet any needs I might have were I to record a series of lectures or produce a podcast. I would say that it's the most comprehensive audio creation app known to be accessible for blind producers.
    For full instructions about how to use this app, please refer to the excellent user guide available through the app itself. You can also reach it by going to www.wooji-juice.com. The user guide is available as HTML or as a PDF document. I recommend the HTML version for easier navigation. Be certain to read the section about accessibility and special VoiceOver controls the developer has added to allow for precise sound editing without the need for sight.
Backpack Studio:
This app is designed to be a portable broadcast studio. The basic idea is that instead of extensive and recording and editing, people would record their presentation live. Sound elements, prepared material and other things can be added through the use of preloaded sound pads. Tapping one causes its sound content to play and be mixed into the recording in progress. In this manner, a podcast or live show can be conducted. The app does a lot of the mixing work for you and can be easily customized. Results can be saved as MP3, among many other formats. In fact, it has facilities for people to stream their content live through SHOUT-cast servers, among other options. This capability is available as an in-app purchase.
    The producer of this app values blind customers and has gone to great lengths to make the app as accessible as possible. People who like the idea of creating audio as more of a performance rather than a careful methodical approach of building and editing favoured by the previous app will want to give Backpack Studio a try.
    As with the Ferrite app, plenty of help is available. It can be found in the settings area of the app. The button to access this is found near the top of the screen after the Files button. You'll find a tutorial, a means of contacting the author, and frequently asked questions. You can also visit the website at www.backpackstudioapp.com.
Just Press Record:
This app is designed for recording and simple editing of a single track. The audio can then be exported for use in other apps. The major selling point of this app, aside from its simple and fully accessible recording/editing controls, is that it generates a transcript of the recording on the fly as you speak. This can be very useful if a searchable transcript is needed for notes or for material accompanying a podcast, making it accessible to people who can't hear the audio.
    Open Planet Software has made this handy app fully accessible with VoiceOver as well as the Voice Control feature introduced in iOS 13. The app makes use of context menus to keep clutter to a minimum. One of the abilities tucked away in such a menu has to do with re-transcribing a recording after you've made extensive edits. Beginners would find this app particularly easy to learn. Priced at a modest $4.99 US, it's well worth the cost. There are no ads, and that one payment unlocks everything the app has to offer. You can learn more about the app and access documentation at www.openplanetsoftware.com.
Further Thoughts on Audio Creation:
This is definitely one of those areas where my minimal experience shows. The apps I've described above are just the tip of the iceberg. There are a great many more in the app store. Everything from simple note recording apps to full on recording and audio publishing tools. Many of these are unfortunately not accessible at all. Others, such as the Anchor podcast creation and publishing app, have seen their commitment to accessibility waver over the years they've been around. They may be useful for more skilled users of iOS devices who are ready to deal with unlabeled buttons and other issues. Major changes to iOS such as those experienced with the release of iOS 15 can throw further difficulties at developers who try to keep their apps stable and accessible to all of their customers. Chances are that if a developer has gone to the trouble of making their app accessible, they'll go to the trouble of fixing accessibility issues which emerge going forward. I would advise people to make them aware of such problems in case nobody else has yet. Also, I would advise patience. This is a very competitive, busy area of development, with many apps offering similar features. Developers are liable to rush out improvements that benefit the majority of users as quickly as possible, and then tackle other issues later. This can be frustrating for people who have come to rely on a single app. I would urge anybody to try to find at least one app that will let them keep working during periods where their preferred app is inaccessible due to unforeseen effects of change.
Cooking With Apps:
There are many ways that your iPhone or iPad can help you with cooking. With Kindle, Apple Books and other reading apps, you will be able to navigate and read thousands of cookbooks. If these were in traditional Braille, they would take up tons of space in your home, and you'd want to be cautious to keep them safe from kitchen disasters. However, with your iOS device safely in an inexpensive waterproof case, these cookbooks are infinitely more searchable and safe where they're needed most. There are also documentaries and cooking shows on services like Netflix. These can easily be found and listened to. Many of these shows have audio description included, so you won't miss out on purely visual elements. The YouTube portal has become a tremendous resource of instruction, as people from all over have posted videos on how to do everything under the sun, including cooking. These don't have audio description as a general rule. However, people often discuss what they're doing while they cook. There are also an increasing number of accessible food-related apps. These can do all manner of things, from collecting and managing recipes available on the Internet, to keeping track of what ingredients you have or need to acquire. They frequently can place timers into recipes, so you just have to tap and start them when you reach the appropriate step. Apps are also capable of converting measurements and identifying needed items using the camera in your device and Cloud-based artificial intelligence. There are also more appliances that may be connected via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to an app on your iOS device that you can use to check status and control. This is just starting to enter the mainstream as this guide is being written in 2019. Devices such as the iGrill and Instant Pot are two of the more widely known examples of this trend. Digital assistants built into smart speakers and available for iOS devices may also work with some kitchen appliances. All of this kind of accessibility is thanks to an emerging phenomenon called "the Internet of things".
    Most of this sort of thing goes far beyond my level of interest in cooking. I cook what I need to for feeding myself and any company. However, I don't enjoy cooking like a great many people seem to. I certainly enjoy eating, though. Every once in a while, I do get curious about how some delicious food I enjoy gets made. As a result, I will derive some satisfaction from the investments I've made in apps and cookbooks to experience what they're like to use. If you add up the costs of every app and cookbook I purchased in order to research and write this section and the Read All About It section of the guide, you would come up well short of $100 Canadian. I currently have no so-called "smart" appliances. Acquiring those would certainly go beyond $100. However, I believe you could equip a kitchen quite well with smart appliances for well under $1000 Canadian, barring major refitting such as a smart fridge or oven. Money can open up a far greater range of options regarding accessible appliances than used to be the case.
    This subsection examines some of the apps my explorations turned up that blind people may find useful in the kitchen. The app store is the place to go for a huge number of resources to help people make the most of their time in the kitchen. From apps that help identify groceries to ones that let you collect and use recipes found online, iOS has a lot to offer people. The catch is that a larger portion of food and cooking-related apps either won't be accessible at all or will only be partially accessible. If you obtain apps found through your own exploration of the app store or recommended by sighted users, be prepared for disappointment. Have a good grasp of the capabilities of VoiceOver and go in with realistic expectations. On the positive side, Apple is pretty good at giving refunds if you find an app to be unworkable, but nothing says that they have to give your money back. They might simply decide that your difficulties don't warrant a refund. They might ask you to try contacting the app developer to resolve difficulties. Therefore, I recommend that people not spend money they aren't ready to lose. Also, make certain that an app would be something you would really appreciate if it were accessible. If you contact the developer, keep in mind that he or she might never have heard of blind people using iOS devices. Politeness has turned many app developers into staunch supporters of accessibility. You very well might be the one responsible for convincing a developer that we're an audience worth pursuing.
    One example of an app like this is called Kitchen Stories. It was recommended by the Apple editorial staff and was also free. I read the description and learned that it was an app that let people share recipes, stories, advice, and videos. I found that the videos just had music and no talking in them. Many of the buttons in the app are labelled in a way unreadable to VoiceOver. When I tried to read the daily stories and recipes, I found them perfectly easy to read. The app has a shopping tab that generates a list based on recipes you're interested in making. That seems like it would possibly be useful and accessible. Overall, this app doesn't quite meet my threshold for something I'd use. However, you could read a recipe your sighted friend found in the app. There are likely other parts of the app that are accessible enough to get something out of. It's just not as suited perfectly for use by blind people as other better labelled apps are. It's a perfect example of something free to try that turned out to be moderately useful but not perfectly accessible.
Timing Apps:
Timing can be pretty important in the kitchen. Two useful apps here are the Camellia Tea Timer app developed by David Norcott, and the Timeglass app developed by Cosmic Teapot. The Camellia app has a group of timers set to the proper time to steep a cup of various kinds of tea. You can add more timers if the tea you get has different instructions. Just double tap on the timer to start it when you begin steeping the tea. It will chime when the tea is ready.
    The Timeglass app lets you create and run many different timers, which can have spoken instructions or unique sounds. This is the heavy artillery of timing, and it's fully accessible. It comes with a library of pre-built timers. You can also enable a widget that lets you check your timers while the phone is locked.
Cooking Shows on Streaming Services:
Before embarking on an attempt to cook something, it can really save a lot of time and trouble if you have some idea what you're doing and how to go about it. One of the exciting ways your iOS device can help you learn more about cooking is by allowing you to easily access shows and videos. Services like Netflix offer food-related documentaries and shows with full audio description. The AMI app offers cooking shows crafted to be accessible. The CBC Gem app has some interesting stuff with and without audio description. And, of course, there's YouTube. All kinds of people show off their cooking chops there, and the app is fully accessible with VoiceOver.
    It all comes down to the VoiceOver screen reader and accessibility awareness among app developers. All the major video content providers have made their apps easy to operate for blind people. Not everything is described, but all the videos can be paused and navigated easily without sight. This makes it possible to pause and take notes or navigate backward a bit to hear something you didn't quite catch. Below, we'll briefly go over some of the content available from several streaming apps.
    The AMI app makes content made by Accessible Media Incorporated available online. These TV shows are designed from the start to include audio description, rather than it being added after the show's completion. Content is made available free of charge and can be downloaded for viewing while offline. Shows are easily navigated, with pausing as simple as a two-finger double tap and playback controls fully accessible.
    There are a good number of food shows. "Four Senses" features Christine Ha, a totally blind chef who won the third season of Master Chef. You have four seasons of Four Senses. "Food Spin" features a chef who goes around Toronto in a truck called The Holy Grill. There's "Menu Match-Up", which has two visually impaired chefs competing to cook food. All of these shows plus others are fully described. The app is easy to learn and built from the start to be as accessible as possible.
    A whole lot of documentaries and shows about food are available for users of Netflix. This streaming service has made its app fully accessible using VoiceOver. Also, it has made audio description available for much of its content. This includes plenty of food-related shows. I just typed the word "food" into the search engine and got loads of them. These included Anthony Bourdain's "Parts Unknown", "Sugar Rush", "In Defence of Food", and many more.
    Two particularly notable examples I found were "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat", and "Chef's Table". Both of them are fully described. "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" is a documentary where Samin Nosrat, a renowned chef, goes to different countries to find out what elements go into various cuisines and tastes. Without audio description, it would be very hard to follow, since people from the countries travelled to speak their own languages. Thankfully, the audio description provided by Netflix includes a translation of the subtitles into spoken English. This makes the experience a fascinating one even for kitchen-avoiding folks like yours truly.
    "Chef's Table" is about different famous cooks around the world who discuss using various ingredients found in their area. They also talk about their experiences and circumstances, as well as traditional dishes. We hear from illegal immigrants who have carved out lives for themselves and brought their expertise to the US. Again, the excellent audio description clarifies a lot, making this enjoyable and informative for the adventurous eaters among us.
    Netflix is absolutely worth its subscription price for people wanting to learn about cooking as well as many other subjects. There's a large amount of well-described documentary content. I know I've just scratched the surface with my amateur searching. There's lots to be discovered. Also, it's possible to listen to a show while the Netflix app is in the background. You can do that and take notes in another app, pausing by using the two-finger double tap when you need to.
    The CBC Gem app lets you stream CBC shows as well as live streams of CBC TV channels. You can do this ad-free by paying a monthly subscription, or simply put up with the ads. There is a lot of content with described audio. However, you have to turn it on when you want it. There's no setting to make it come on automatically. To accomplish this, once you start a show playing, flick right or up over the controls, depending on how your device is oriented. You will eventually come to the Described Audio button if the show you've chosen has it available. Double tap that button and the description will be turned on. The situation has improved considerably since the above info was written for the first edition. The CBC Gems app has gotten far better at remembering that you want audio description. Every so often, however, you'll still have to use the steps above to turn audio description on.
    There's a "Food for Thought" episode of The Nature of Things show that is all about what we eat and what we should be eating according to scientists, which has described audio. Another show available from the BBC is called "Cooking with Joy". It doesn't have audio description, but the host talks a lot, describing things about British food. Not everything really needs audio description to be useful.
    YouTube is one of those services that everyone has heard of. I think of it like the wild west of video content. Basically, anybody can create video content once they have an account. You'll find a broad range of quality in all kinds of ways. Some videos will have so little dialogue that they'll be utterly useless. However, you'll often find videos where people talk enough about what they're doing or presenting so that you can learn something without having to actually see the video.
    The YouTube app itself is easy to use. VoiceOver is supported, and there are spoken hints as you move over the controls. It's even possible for blind people to create videos of their own. You can easily navigate, pause, play, and find videos of interest. Also, you can subscribe to channels created by people and follow people, so you are alerted when they release new content.
    The CNIB has some videos on kitchen appliances and organization that people might find useful. Blind people have also posted videos to YouTube, demonstrating how it's possible to cook while blind. Molly Burke has one about baking. A blind mother posted one about how she cooks dinner for her family. For the most part, though, you'll be finding videos made for sighted people that, if you're lucky, will have enough dialogue to be useful.
    It doesn't stop there. There are other options for finding useful video content. Sites and apps like MasterClass offer actual courses developed by experts in their fields. MasterClass is one such option, but it's a pretty costly one. Too costly for me to test whether all the components are accessible. I'm certain the videos would be easy to listen to and navigate. However, they wouldn't necessarily describe everything. They do seem to be lectures, so you'd certainly be able to learn something from the courses. Also, don't forget about podcasts. There are plenty of those about food that are entirely audio and accessible with your favourite podcast app. Two that spring to mind are Mary Mammoliti's Kitchen Confession Podcast, and a somewhat older one called Cooking In The Dark.
Apps with Recipes:
There are many apps to help you find and use recipes. These include apps based on cookbooks like the Joy of Cooking app and the Bettie Crocker Cookbook app. These let you search recipes far more easily than the actual cookbooks and have other useful features. For instance, they can build shopping lists based on recipes and convert units of measurement. They often have timers built into the recipe steps that need them.
    Other apps take a more wholistic approach and help with a whole range of tasks involved in good food management. One food management app that really stands out as being highly accessible is the Paprika Food Manager 3 by Hindsight Labs LLC. There are millions of recipes found on sites all over the web. The app lets you capture these recipes directly from various sites using its own built in browser. You can easily save these recipes into your collection, and they're displayed with ingredients and directions separately. The app also has a pantry feature to keep track of what you have on hand and can build shopping lists based on recipes to help get what you need. It succeeds at being a highly praised, all-in-one solution that's fully accessible with VoiceOver. You just need to find recipes to add by importing from the web or entering manually.
    Apps from Famous Foodies
    FitMenCook, developed by Nibble Apps Ltd, is an accessible app based on the work of a widely followed YouTube star and blogger. Kevin Curry has a massive following for his FitMenCook website and YouTube channel. The app has over 500 recipes that each have a video with spoken instructions. These videos are easy to navigate using standard methods. You can read the recipes but can't navigate line by line, so that's one potential trouble spot. However, all the tabs and elements in the app seem well labelled for use with VoiceOver. I've come across several positive messages about this app from members of AppleVis.
Costs and Other Concerns:
These apps range in price from around $3 to $15. I don't think I've come across one over $20, although some are subscription based. There are also some free apps like one called Tasty that seems potentially useful. However, it requires you to use Facebook to sign up for it and seems to be tied in with the Nielsen research company. They're the folks who did all the TV surveys to figure out what was popular. If the app is free and does a lot, chances are that it wants your data in exchange. Keep that in mind when exploring various apps. It isn't always such a bad deal as people worried about corporations and data make it out to be. Just be aware of that possibility going in, and read the agreements when you create accounts.
Concluding Thoughts on Productivity:
What makes an iOS device such a compelling productivity tool? You can find software for laptop computers which can do everything covered here. However, A LAPTOP OR DESKTOP COMPUTER JUST ISN'T AS HANDY. IT COMES DOWN TO how you can combine different capabilities to help you accomplish things ON A DEVICE HELD IN HAND OR POCKET. The apps I've talked about above are clever creations designed for very specific purposes. While these are wonderful in their own right, there's nothing really revolutionary regarding what they do individually. Recording tools, word processing, GPS navigation, timers, and other elements covered in this guide existed long before the iPhone had become more than a possibility that smacked of science fiction. The revolutionary strength of an iOS device is the way it lets you combine so many capabilities and bring them everywhere you go. There's a good reason why people are always looking at their smartphones. They let you do so many different things. While writing an email, you are literally a few taps or gestures away from checking the Maps app to see where the cab you're in is taking you. You can listen to your favourite tunes and talk with friends and family around the world via voice, text, or video. During a lull in that conversation, you can do calculations, look up an interesting fact using Google, read your favourite book, etc. You can go instantly from writing a document to ordering dinner and back to the essay. If necessary, you could do it all one-handed or by using only your voice.
    Having so much information literally at hand is a tremendous help in countless endeavours. This certainly includes writing. If I'm doing research for a story, I can turn to Google or Siri for quick, concise answers. To dig deeper, there's Wikipedia, dictionaries, and thesauri, plus any ebook I've purchased and have on my device. All of that content is easily and quickly searchable.
    I could have done all of this while on a bus or in a cab rather than at my desk in my apartment. Some accessories, such as the keyboard I'm typing on, an external power bank, etc., can prove quite helpful. People with greater dexterity can write quite proficiently even without the Bluetooth keyboard I insist upon having. My wife Sara is quite speedy with the Braille Screen Input method that VoiceOver provides. For more serious audio recording, an external microphone likely wouldn't go amiss. When it comes right down to it, having the right apps and being proficient in their use makes the most significant difference.
    Being able to easily tap into the shared wealth of online lessons and videos wherever you happen to be is a massively helpful ability. The cooking examples I gave earlier are applicable to all kinds of projects. There are documentaries, shows, podcasts, and videos on things as diverse as crafts, to knitting, to public speaking, to building furniture. The possibilities are endless and very useful when you can pause, go back, and take notes.
    When you're undertaking serious work, do yourself a gigantic favour and have a plan B. Find at least one alternative app that will let you keep working on your projects even if your preferred app has accessibility issues. I learned that lesson the hard way with the Ulysses app I used to write the majority of this guide with. Thankfully, I had another somewhat similar writing app ready to go during the two months it took to sort out issues introduced with iOS 13. Depending on what you're doing, you may not have as much choice as other people, since only a fraction of apps on iOS are accessible in a truly practical way. As awareness and accessibility laws expand, this situation is improving quickly relative to what I've experienced on other platforms. If you find an app that would be helpful if it were accessible, contact the developer before giving up on it. Many of them are only too happy to put in the effort to make their apps as accessible and delightful to use as possible for everyone, including blind people. Your moments of advocacy just might make it possible for others to pursue their own creative or employment dreams.

Shopping on Your iOS Device:
A good friend of ours came to visit during the cold and wintery start of 2019. We wanted to try something different for dinner, but getting to a restaurant was difficult and expensive. Another wrinkle was figuring out what things we had never tried before were going to taste like. More menus of places are posted online these days, so this problem at least was solvable with some pre-travel googling. However, it's even better and more economical when you don't have to travel and can get things delivered to your door. Furthermore, you can take your own time browsing the fully accessible menus of places and asking Siri, Alexa, or Google what the heck this or that unfamiliar thing was.
    Using an app called Uber Eats, we found that there was plenty of choice within our delivery range that cost far less than a cab ride for even one of us would have. We picked a middle eastern restaurant with a good rating from other customers, and started making sense of the menu and picking what unfamiliar things we would try. The food arrived in good hot condition precisely when the app said that it would. We got notifications which kept us informed as our order was prepared and on its way to us. Payment was done automatically. There was no need to show anybody our credit card besides the Uber company that acted as middleman. The delivery driver simply brought the food to our building, buzzed us, and came up to our apartment. He wasn't there longer than half a minute and could simply give us the food and proceed to his next destination.
    We quickly sorted out which meal was for each of us and enjoyed a delicious dinner. Some time after we ate, I got a notification that asked if I wanted to adjust the delivery driver's tip. It also encouraged me to rate the meals chosen, the restaurant's quality overall, and the delivery service. Each step was simple and fully accessible using VoiceOver.
    When it comes to shopping for physical things, blind people have traditionally faced two main obstacles. Getting to where the goods are and safely back with potentially heavy acquisitions is one barrier. Actually, navigating the store and finding what you want to purchase is another. If you ask the staff for help or go with a volunteer helper, you're subject to their schedule and any conscious or unconscious thoughts and biases they might have about you. As a blind person, you might never know how that influenced your trip or purchasing decisions. You'll never know about that slightly unfashionable chair on sale that would perfectly suit your situation, but the sighted helper wouldn't dream of owning. Because your volunteer is pressed for time, you might not know that rather than the snack you picked, a long missed favourite food you hadn't been able to track down for years was right there on the shelf but simply not mentioned. Online shopping has removed a lot of exploration related problems and friction from the shopping experience for blind people. Taking our time and fully exploring purchase possibilities on our own terms and impulses is empowering. We can learn about products by reading the written descriptions of goods on offer. Even better, we can even go farther afield and read reviews of goods and services. More video reviews are appearing on YouTube and other venues. These typically have sound and are spoken by the creators, so we can often hear what a product sounds like when used. Goods are shipped to your door, thereby removing the whole transportation and navigation issue.
    There are some downsides. The largest one being that words don't always fully convey an item's physicality. I've made several purchases of items which have felt entirely different in terms of texture than my research led me to expect. I'm somewhat spatially challenged and have frequently found that my conceptions of an item's size were somewhat off the mark. Had there been a sample in a retail outlet which I could have felt, I would quite possibly have made different choices.
    Your iOS device lets you participate in online shopping via websites through your browser of choice. Furthermore, many retail outlets, such as Amazon, have their own apps to make shopping even easier for people. Not all such apps are made with accessibility in mind. You will doubtless find many instances where shopping via the website is a more preferable experience. Nonetheless, your iOS device can be a great and handy help in this aspect of everyday life. My wife Sara and I get all manner of things, from groceries, to equipment, to medicines online. And then, there are all the digital goods such as books, music, audio dramas, and much more.
Shopping on Websites:
There are many ways to make a website. Your experience will therefore vary from vendor to vendor. However, there are several conventions that most outlets will follow. For the sake of simplicity, this section presumes the use of the Safari browser that comes with iOS. Remember that you can obtain other alternative browsers such as Chrome or Firefox from the app store if you wish. In some cases, each of these may be able to handle different websites or situations encountered online in a manner that works better for your particular needs.
    Careful exploration of a shopping website you intend to use is always a good idea and is well worth the time it takes. This is certainly true when it comes to finding out what's on offer. You may find out about sales and be guided to items that are even better suited to your needs than what you came searching for. Also, careful exploration of any shopping website may reveal options that might not be immediately obvious. For instance, near each item available at Longo's, there's a checkbox. This checkbox indicates whether to allow for substitutions should the item be unavailable. Let's say you order hamburgers and some buns to use with them. If our shopper can't find the exact kind of buns you ordered, he or she will substitute different buns, and you'll still have an easy time eating your burgers. If the box isn't checked, no substitution will be made, and you won't be charged for the buns you didn't get. This may be preferable if, for instance, you were gluten intolerant or had allergies that might come into play if the wrong thing was picked as a substitute. However, you might have to get a bit creative if you end up with burgers and no buns for them.
Creating Accounts and Logging In:
Every online shopping experience I've encountered involves creating your own account with the vendor so that they can advertise to you and ease your shopping experience. This process need not happen right away. Indeed, you can sometimes shop as a guest and never set up an account. You will, however, need to provide any information relevant to the transaction, such as credit card information and address. If you plan to do mor than one transaction with an online vendor, do yourself a favour and create an account. It saves a lot of time and is well worth the hassle. This process will involve filling in a form on the vendor's website. There will be edit fields to type in your name, email address, phone number, etc. I would strongly recommend people become comfortable browsing the web and filling out forms before creating accounts with vendors. Correcting information once it has been entered can be frustrating if you don't have a good handle on how form controls and editing text works.
    Once you have successfully created an account, most vendors will email you welcoming you and providing information. At this point, you will simply need to log or sign in with the credentials used to set up the account. This is far less cumbersome than having to fill in address and other information every time you want to make a purchase. Once you've saved your username and password into the iCloud Keychain, loging into your favourite shopping sites gets easy. Often, vendors won't store all of your credit card information to increase your security. You may, for example, need to enter the CVV number on the back of your card to prove that you are indeed its proper owner.
    While recovering forgotten passwords and such is possible, I would urge everyone to maintain a list of any passwords and other credentials for accounts you create. You could do this securely in the Notes app either using a locked note, or lock the entire Notes app so that it requires Face or Touch ID to unlock. I would recommend having one note with all such information in it that you could access whenever you forgot a password or other account information.
Finding What You Want:
There's really nothing special about browsing an online store versus most other websites. There are simply some conventions that most online stores tend to follow. A common concept is the "shopping cart". Similar to a real physical shopping cart, you can put items you wish to purchase into the cart and carry on shopping for more. Items can be removed from your cart if you have second thoughts. Once you've logged in and added an item to your shopping cart, it will remain there until you leave a store's website.
    Another common concept is the "wish list" where you can add items you may wish to purchase in the future. Items added to such a list can then typically be sorted in various ways, such as from least to most expensive. I'm particularly fond of the Amazon Wish List system, since you can sort and filter even massive numbers of items. I add any book I take a passing fancy to and then watch for price drops and sales.
    Popup menus are another frequent design element. Double tapping on a Menu button will cause a menu to overlay the contents of the site. Flicking to and double tapping an item on the menu will let you access a deeper menu or else take you directly to where you want to go. For instance, if I'm on Amazon, I might double tap on Menu, and then on the Shop by Department item. This brings up another menu of all the various departments in the Amazon store. I often then go to Kindle, which is Amazon's reading system. There are Kindle devices and Kindle books, so I need to double tap on the Kindle Books item in the third deeper menu that emerged when I hit Kindle. At that point, I'm in the Kindle Books department and don't need popup menus to get around. I can either search for the book I want or browse categories and featured content, including sales. There will be pretty standard form controls, links, and headings to help me navigate within the Kindle Books or any other department I reach via the menus described earlier.
    Not all places are as well-designed as others. You may need to spend time learning the particular quirks of an online venue. Typically, though, things tend to be pretty standard when it comes to the elements that make up a store. If you don't like an aspect of your experience, you can usually leave feedback indicating this. Alternatively, you can simply find a different online store that offers what you're after. Google can be very helpful in this regard. Another thing to keep in mind is that some places offer better descriptions of items than others.
    Typically, an item name is actually a link that you can double tap. For example, I might double tap on a book title and find myself in that book's special place in the store. There's likely to be the book's title, author, and other information, plus a brief description of the book and some ratings and reviews of it. There will also be buttons that let me buy the book or add it to a wish list. I find it a good practice to always go into an item's unique area by double tapping on the name, rather than simply buying it from the button that usually accompanies the item's brief description on the department page.
Completing Purchases:
Once you've added what you want to your cart, it's time to complete the checkout process. Here is where things tend to vary. Many places will store your information so that you merely have to double tap on a Proceed to Checkout button, review your cart, and then place your order. This confirms your intent to buy, and the items are shipped to you or are made available for download if they're digital goods. Amazon makes it possible to buy items such as Kindle books merely by double tapping the Buy Now button. This is almost too frictionless and makes impulse purchasing super easy. You can alter this behaviour in settings that are attached to your account. In most cases, there are steps designed to make certain that you're ordering what you intend to. One common practice is to give you a chance to review your cart before continuing. Perhaps, you'll be provided an opportunity to add one or more items to your cart from a selection of items the shop's artificial intelligence thinks you may be interested in. Some shops don't store your sensitive credit card information, so you'll need to re-enter it every time you shop there as part of the checkout process. This can be annoying, but is a pretty secure way of doing things. Typically, you'll have to choose a shipping method or schedule a delivery. At the end of the process, there's usually a final button called something like "place order". Double tap this button to complete the process and confirm your intention. Until that final button is pressed, your order won't be complete. Some shops are set up to send an email reminding you of this. After that final button is pressed, your order will be processed. You'll typically be taken to a confirmation screen which thanks you for shopping with the online retailer. Once an order has been successfully placed, you'll get an email with details of that transaction.
Payment Methods:
Another way to greatly speed up and secure your online shopping is through a service such as PayPal or the more recently created Apple Pay. This shields your bank or credit card information, since these services act as middle partners, thereby limiting your exposure to theft. I've used PayPal for years with no difficulties or incidents. I would recommend creating a PayPal account to anybody who intends to do a lot of online shopping. This is especially useful when shopping at smaller, less well-known online stores catering to niche markets. An example of this would be an audio drama studio like Spiteful Puppet Creations. They and many similar studios sell the audio dramas they produce directly to customers via an online store. Using PayPal means I don't have to worry if their security isn't as robust as other, more heavily trafficked places. None of my personal information, besides address if needed to ship a CD, has been revealed to them.
    Apple Pay is another very secure way to pay for things. More websites and online businesses are making this method available. Once you've added a bank or credit card to the Wallet app on your iPhone, you can use it easily to quickly pay for things. You'll need to verify your identity with your passcode, Face ID or Touch ID depending on your device. Apple Pay can store shipping and contact information when you use it on websites so that the checkout process is even less time-consuming.
    Because Apple Pay can work with bank cards as well as credit cards, this can be very helpful for people who might otherwise find that they can't pay online shops easily. Another nice thing about these payment methods is that records are automatically kept of all transactions. Also, you can set notification settings to be instantly notified of any transaction. This lets you know that a payment attempt has succeeded. It also acts as a security measure since you'd be made aware if anyone else tried to use your account, perhaps after borrowing your device, to make purchases you don't approve of.
Using Artificial Intelligence Via Innosearch:

    One new service has recently emerged which takes advantage of large language model artificial intelligence to specifically help blind people shop online. Innosearch is a one-stop portal which also now features a phone number for people wanting a completely screenless spoken experience. At the time of this writing in May 2025, this number seems to require the caller to be in the United States. However, the web shopping experience also works in the UK, Canada and Australia.
    This is still a very recent development. Personally, I have yet to experience any benefit of using it beyond questioning the AI about a product to gain details. For instance, I was able to figure out how to switch between devices on a Bluetooth keyboard I had already purchased by questioning the AI about the keyboard. Over time, this service is very likely to improve. The idea at its core is also likely to become more broadly used in online shopping as large language model AI proliferates and becomes less expensive for companies to employ. Combining this with the ability to access the service via phone will help many people who find it more difficult to deal with online shopping via screens in general.
Shopping Using Apps:
Many retail outlets have apps that, in theory, add to the ease of shopping using your iOS device. They typically make use of interface elements familiar to iOS users such as tabs, buttons, etc. These apps may also allow the use of Apple Pay. Many of them will also let you redeem a physical gift card by taking a picture of the code on it with your device's camera, which can be very useful for blind people. You will pretty much always have the choice of whether to use an app developed by the retail outlet or shop on the website.
    One example of the kind of imperfect but manageable situation you'll run into happens with the Longo's app. Longo's is a service that delivers groceries to your home. That can be tremendously useful for blind people. Their app and website are both made to be accessible. However, either because of visual design choices or other factors, things aren't nearly as easy as shopping at Amazon with its app and website. You have to feel and scroll around the app to find what you want. Things such as your cart, featured items, etc., have buttons that don't read as buttons. Instead, you will hear things like "cart off", "specials off", etc. It's consistent, so you can get the hang of it, but there's friction where there shouldn't be.
    Another thing to remember is that the speed of reaction can differ greatly between shopping sites. With the Longo's app, it will often seem like your last double tap hasn't registered. Nothing will have changed even after ten to fifteen seconds. And then, you'll give one last check and suddenly find new content has appeared at last, and you're where you want to be. This is also the case during checkout. Fortunately, a successful checkout always results in an email being sent, so there's no need to worry about paying twice for an order or anything like that. Just review your cart or the contents of that confirmation email carefully to make certain you haven't added any more items than you meant to. This is an especially easy mistake to make if you follow the common practice when shopping for groceries of building the next order based on the prior one. This can save a lot of time, but has that danger of adding an extra instance of an item, not realizing it was already there from last time.
    These gripes aside, I very much value Longos's service and app. You can literally go around your home, checking what's still plentiful in your fridge, and add what you need while standing right there holding your device. People outside the Greater Toronto area will need to find a similar service to try. Most often, you will be able to call customer service and obtain assistance in placing your order if the app and website prove too difficult to use.
    In contrast, the Apple Store app is a superb example of something close to shopping perfection. You can easily browse through categories of items and learn quickly what's on sale or being featured. The app will even help you when you're standing inside an actual Apple store. Responsive speed is quick and clear. There's no waiting around. Checkout uses Apple Pay if you have this enabled, and, thus, is as painless as spending money can possibly be. To top it off, you'll be notified as your package makes its way to your door or is ready for pickup. Sections of the app are neatly separated into various tabs, including one for your basket of items.
    One thing to remember is that updates to apps are a common occurrence. Accessibility is not always thought about or tested for before such an update is released. An app you can use without difficulty one day might be rendered harder or impossible to use after an update. There are a couple of things you can do to combat this. One of these is to contact the app developer and report your difficulty. Frequently, they have speedily addressed concerns I've raised. The same difficulty happens occasionally with websites. Another thing to do is not to accept updates to shopping apps until you're confident that no accessibility issues have been introduced. This method requires you to keep watch on social media or at least the AppleVis site to be aware of unfavourable developments. It also requires you to take control of accepting updates and not simply receive them automatically. The more proactive you are, the less likely it will be that you'll be caught off guard and unable to use an app you might generally rely on. Keep in mind that the longer you wait to update, the greater the chance that other factors such as security improvements will make it necessary to update. Security gets improved. New features are added. As a general rule, I don't wait past one update in hopes of a better accessibility experience.
    Some apps can facilitate getting information about products. Thanks to the economic turmoil unleashed by President Trump, there has been a dramatic spike in the drive to check where things are produced and "Buy Canadian". There are indeed apps for that. One popular and reasonably accessible option is called Maple Scan. Full of information about how firmly Canadian products actually are in terms of manufacture and other factors, this app is designed to be used in stores. You can scan products with their QR codes or simply type in their name and perform searches. The app is full of Canadianisms and humour which you'll encounter if you make a mistake or search for something not found in the database.
Minimizing Hassle and Disappointment:
Here are some general thoughts on how to shop online with as much grace and as little hassle as possible. As a blind consumer, online shopping can be a real liberation. However, one needs to approach with the realization that things can and will go wrong from time to time. This can be because of misunderstanding by you, the consumer, or by the shop or people who deliver what you purchase. I've had plenty of minor examples of this over twenty plus years of shopping online. Occasionally, it's best just to accept what has happened and move on. That's essentially what happened when I got a month's supply of frozen burgers, but not the buns I was expecting to eat them in. I ended up using bagels or eating them off the plate as one might do with a steak. I had neglected to make certain that substitutes would be found for items which weren't in stock, as the buns I ordered happened not to be when my groceries were picked. There have been some occasions where deliveries were left in the lobby of my building or not delivered at all. This was usually due to delivery drivers not reading the extra information I had entered, hoping to prevent such problems. Information about my buzzer code or the note about my being blind and to take the item up to the apartment door. Bad enough when the item in question is a new piece of technology you've backed on Kickstarter and have no idea what the package feels like. Thanks to the Seeing AI app, this was an issue which I was able to solve independently by scanning the addresses on numerous packages present in the lobby at the time. Infinitely more stressful when it's a dinner you've ordered which includes two large drinks in those big restaurant cups with their questionable lids. Keeping the bag steady and preventing anything from colliding with it while navigating a busy apartment lobby with one working hearing aid and a white cane does tend to put one's nerves on edge. On the other hand, being able to order a meal from McDonald's and have it delivered to my apartment was a longstanding childhood dream come true.
    It's always good to have a plan B for anything essential. I make certain that I have more than one source for things like groceries, electronics, etc. I also try to keep ahead so that I don't come too close to running out of consumable supplies. These practices tend to minimize the times I need to call on sighted friends or spend extra money to solve supply problems which need not be emergencies with a bit of preparedness.
    Sometimes, you'll simply be unable to roll with the punches and want to insist on your rights as a customer. This might involve returning an item which proves unsuitable. It might involve insisting on a refund for a digital good which was bought mistakenly or had quality issues. I recently requested a refund for a bundle of movies which ended up not having audio description for most of them. Thankfully, I had kept the email receipt, which you're pretty much certain to get when making any online purchase. This contained the information needed to report the problem. Strictly speaking, I may not have gotten a refund in that particular case, since the terms of sale stipulated that all purchases were final. Thankfully, the customer service representative who dealt with this case sided with me.
    It's always good practice to look at the terms and policies of online stores, so you know your rights, or lack thereof, ahead of time. Lazy assumptions can come back to bite you. In most cases, I've found that keeping any receipts or emails dealing with online orders is a good habit. Until the item arrives, and you know you're happy with it, hang onto those emails. You should also learn your rights in the event of fraud. Learn what actions you can take and what your bank, credit card or middleman service like PayPal or Apple Pay will do to protect you. You might, for example, be able to stop payments from going through in the first place if you act quickly.
    Sometimes, our inability to see pictures of physical items will leave us with an erroneous idea of what they're like. I've bought keyboards after reading and hearing them described many times by many different people, only to end up with something which was shorter, thinner, or otherwise different from I pictured it would be. To some degree, I think we have to be ready to accept that. More often than not, I've been ultimately happy with what I've purchased. If I'm not, I've often been able to gift it to someone who could make better use of it and found this preferable to returning things.
    When it comes to buying digital goods, I've been pleased with what I've gotten as well as the process of obtaining it. When I got the movie bundle I mentioned above, I could and should have checked more thoroughly to see if the individual films had described audio before making my purchase. Having heard a few of them described in the past, I made the incorrect assumption that all the films would come with described audio. That assumption bit me. Only two or three of the nine movies in the bundle had it. Thankfully, all ended well in this case. Buying books and audio dramas, I've been able to keep returns to a minimum by listening to trailers, reading descriptions and information on whether books supported text to speech and screen readers. I'd go so far as to say that finding satisfaction in purchasing digital goods is even more of a sure bet for blind people than when buying physical goods.
Going Radical with Kickstarter:
Another option when it comes to getting both physical and digital goods you might want is backing campaigns on Kickstarter. This is an increasingly common and accepted way of starting a business or launching a product. The concept is that an idea is put forth on the Kickstarter platform in the form of a fundraising campaign. This campaign has a project page that includes a video demonstrating a prototype or explaining the project. It also has more detailed information about the product or service being funded. There is a funding goal set at the start of the campaign. People can back this idea with pledges of money that will only be paid if the campaign obtains enough pledges to meet the funding goal set at its start. If the campaign is successful, funds are collected from those who pledged, and if all goes well, backers will be rewarded in whatever way the campaign architects have deemed suitable for the level of backing each contributor makes. A common reward is to get a product at a price far cheaper than once it goes to ordinary retail channels. Backers also get products earlier than everyone else can, since their rewards must be fulfilled first. They, after all, have provided the capital needed to start production of whatever was backed.
    Your iOS device and the Kickstarter app is a splendid way for blind people to explore, examine, and back these campaigns. I have backed over fifty so far. Mostly, I'm interested in ebooks being funded via this means. However, I have also backed some physical products, including a ratchet belt that I now wear. During that campaign, I was able to use my iPhone to find out about the "Smart Belt", hear the owner's video explaining the virtues of these belts, and pledge enough money to receive one as a reward. Further, I could contact the owner with questions and receive answers. This clarified points such as how to attach the buckle to the belt. I was also able to fully participate in the conversation among backers as things proceeded. This was very exciting to have that level of engagement while a product was under development.
    The Kickstarter app and platform are just one example of many different crowdfunding methods. I focus on it because, in my somewhat limited experience, the Kickstarter site and app have proved to be the most easily accessible. Indiegogo is another very popular choice. This is yet another way in which iOS allows blind people to have an increased voice in the marketplace. I've made many people more aware of the needs of blind people who might be interested in their products. Many have gone out of their way to make their products more accessible. This includes making ebooks more easily navigable by screen readers and apps like Voice Dream Reader. The makers of Shokz bone conduction headsets have long been aware of their blind users and have equipped their headsets with built-in speech guidance. Part of why this awareness is spreading is that we have more ways to independently engage with and find out about different products.
Making Good Use of Product Reviews:
Finding reviews of products is easy to do. Type the name of the product you're interested in followed by a comma, followed by the word review into a search engine, and you're off to the races. So far, so good. The problem is that we're all coming at things with different needs and desires. Our idea of what constitutes an ideal product will differ. One must also be careful of fake reviews. These are written by people or artificial intelligence bots with ulterior motives, such as sabotaging a business or perhaps making alternatives seem like better purchases. Sometimes, money changes hands and people are paid to write flattering reviews. This kind of thing absolutely happens online.
    Sometimes, negative reviews are absolutely warranted. A product will simply be badly designed, poorly built, hard to use, etc. Another cause of faulty information is lack of effort or thoroughness. People won't take the time to read instructions or explore a product's capabilities and draw a false conclusion that the product doesn't have a given capability.
    There are similarly many reasons for overly positive reviews. Money certainly is one of them. People are willing to pay for positive advertising. Also, there's incomplete experience. Perhaps, a reviewer hasn't used a product enough to reveal its shortcomings. As with negative reviews, there are honest and dishonest causes for their being online.
    As blind online shoppers, we need to be particularly mindful about how things are described and the motives behind the words we use to come to decisions. When you're shopping online and can't see pictures or video, words written and spoken about products are all you have to work with.
    YouTube product reviews or other videos related to products of interest can be very useful for blind shoppers. They give us the potential of hearing a product in action. One might hear what a keyboard sounds like or hear the sound of a vacuum cleaner being put through its paces. That can convey a great deal about a product. For instance, hearing a keyboard being moved and put down on a surface might reveal something of the weight and build quality to the experienced listener. Frequently, it's the more accidentally recorded sound which reveals a product's nature.
    One basic thing which should always be attempted is to find a variety of reviews about a product in different places. This helps make certain that you'll get honest, different impressions from a range of people who are in no way connected with each other. They'll focus on different things and have different styles of presentation. You can then build your overall impression on more solid footing.
    Over the years, I've learned to get to know the likes and dislikes of YouTube influencers who create channels focussing on a given subject of interest. For instance, there's Erin who has built a channel called Nomad Nation. In my hunt for good packs and bags to carry my stuff around with, I've found his reviews as well as those from another channel called Pack Hacker to be thorough and well done. I've heard enough reviews about packs I was interested in possibly obtaining, as well as other gear which fell outside my consideration to build an overall sense of how they approach products. This can be valuable when taking their input on board and thinking about whether a product will meet your more unique needs.
    Basically, these influencers stand or fall on reputation. They have a lot to lose if people find that companies have influenced them in a manner which they failed to make clear. The same goes for sources of written product reviews, such as magazines or websites which specialize in this. It helps to locate established sources of more objective information about products of interest. You can then build a picture of what products stand up to scrutiny and experience. You can get a sense of how happy people are with investing in products at various price points or qualities.
    Don't expect that you'll have a perfect sense of what a product will feel like or its exact shape. Having a product's reality match preconceptions built entirely on people's descriptions seldom happens. I have now purchased dozens of products based on what I've read and heard about them online. There have been times when my conception of a product's shape and feel have been incredibly close to perfect. It's almost scary when that happens because it's so rare. I remember getting a combination power bank and charger from Anker. It was so close to how I thought it would feel like that touching it for the first time was as creepy as it was delightful. It felt like someone had read my mind right down to the item's texture. Other times, I've miscalculated how suitable a given size would be. There have been a couple of keyboards which were simply too compact to use comfortably on my lap. Speakers have sounded different than I expected. Unless you can arrange for direct experience of products before purchasing them, be prepared for a degree of unmet expectation. That is a less obvious price of shopping online.
An Online Shopping Trip:
One thing I've been keenly interested in for decades now is modern audio drama. To end this section on shopping in a more helpful way than in the first edition, I thought it might be a good idea to take you through a complete experience. Dealing with digital goods rather than physical eliminates issues of delivery and such. This is likely to differ somewhat depending on country and other factors. Another thing which can differ is how one pays. I tend to do this with PayPal or simply with my credit card. PayPal can also be tied directly into a bank account, which can be very helpful if you don't have a credit card. I will assume that you've registered with PayPal or can figure out how to set up a payment method of your choice.
    Most modern audio dramas are made available as digital downloads. You can download them as compressed files, individual MP3 or other audio files, or use an app created by the producer of the audio dramas. If you download dramas in zipped MP3 files, you could then use an app like VLC Media Player or Voice Dream Reader to play them. Otherwise, you can use the app from the app store, which is appropriate for the audio drama shop you purchased it from. For instance, people using the Audible site should be using the Audible app, which is freely available from the app store to play purchased content. There are other apps for content from Big Finish and Graphic Audio.
    One of the main sources of good audiobooks and dramas these days is at www.audible.ca. The end of the address will change to be appropriate for your country. It's a dot com ending for people in the US. For UK Audible listeners, it's a dot co dot uk ending. You can find a stupendously massive range of audio that is pretty affordable. Most modern audio dramas eventually end up on Audible. However, there's usually a period of exclusivity before this happens, when only the shop run by the creator of a new audio drama has it available for purchase. You can listen on smartphones, tablets, computers, etc. New stuff is added all the time. I cover Audible more extensively in the section called "Reading Books on iOS Devices".
    For people into comics, westerns, and fantasy, you might want to check out www.graphicaudio.net. They have a unique approach with audiobooks in that they do the full book as an audio movie with voice acting, music, and sound. Their offerings never disappoint, but can be expensive if you ever get hooked on one of their longer-running series. You can buy these in one transaction as a complete series set. However, this can be expensive even if you are lucky enough to visit when a sale is happening. Graphic Audio offers reward points and may also provide discount codes. There are tabs near the cart on that site where you can enter these. If you choose to shop here, just be aware that it's a more complex place. Take the time to explore the site carefully for tabs and banners where you might be able to enter discount codes, make use of any reward points, and find out about sales.
    Another place offering first-rate audio entertainment is at www.bigfinish.com. You'll find all sorts of British properties like "Doctor Who", "Torchwood", "Sherlock Holmes", and much more. They do spectacularly good work. I particularly like their classics, such as the Dorian Gray series.
    If you're into H.P. Lovecraft and dark but campy horror, you may want to drop in at www.hplhs.org where you can purchase a growing range of dramas based on Lovecraft's work and ideas. They don't have the economics of Audible or Big Finish, but still manage to create some impressive stuff.
    With the one exception of the Lovecraft Historical Society, all of these audio drama vendors have produced their own special app for easy downloading and listening to their content. Simply obtain the Audible, Big Finish, and GraphicAudio apps from the app store. Once you've created accounts with the vendors you want to use and logged into your account while in the appropriate app, you'll find it easy to download and enjoy what you purchase on the respective websites. For audio drama places you find that don't have such facilities and simply have you download a zipped file containing MP3 files, I suggest you use VLC Media Player or Voice Dream Reader. Both of these apps work quite well as audio drama players. All of these online venues and the apps or software associated with them are very accessible for blind people as well as people who are able to see.
    Have a good look around each of these different sites, so you find what best suits you. The layout of the sites and the forms you need to fill out to register differ slightly. However, the basic procedures will be similar. Audible is the big exception, since it offers the ability to subscribe, which entitles you to Audible credits and discounts. Recently, it has become possible to purchase Audible Books and credits directly from within the Audible app. This is an easy process since it's just like any other in-app purchase. You would then spend the credit you purchased on an Audible title. There's a catch to taking this easy approach. Given the sales and daily deals, there are times when you could buy the book more cheaply using cash rather than spending a credit. For the other sites, you'll be using PayPal, Apple Pay, your credit card, as you would in pretty much any online shop.
    A good classic tale well told awaits you at the Big Finish site. Let's go to www.bigfinish.com and see what's there. Below the search field, you'll find a series of links taking you to different areas of interest. Double tap on "audiobooks". This is where a large collection of dramas and some adapted audiobooks can be found. Big Finish has many ranges of drama which each have a hub. We could spend hours combing through it all, and you should do this to find things which suit your interest. Follow the links to different areas of the site and explore the categories. There must be over a thousand hours of well produced audio drama here.
    For an example, let's say I wanted to purchase the Big Finish version of Treasure Island. This is a splendidly good adaptation. We can get to it quickly via the search field at the top of the website. Simply type "Treasure Island" into the field and then double tap on the "return" key near the bottom of your keyboard. The results will then be displayed. Each is a heading as well as a link. There's only one result in this case, so simply move down to it using the rotor turned to headings and then double tap on it. This takes you into the item. Think of it like picking the book off a shelf that the search directed you to. You haven't bought it yet, but you now hold it in your hand and can examine it. Indeed, you'll find all sorts of information about who stars in the drama, how long it is, how much it costs. You want to purchase it as a download rather than a physical CD. Once you've read through the description and perhaps listened to the trailer found on the page, you can add this to your cart. In my case, it would cost $7.49 Canadian. Double tap on the button which says the price. It also indicates that it's for the download version. You will then be taken to a screen where it says "Success! The item has been added to your basket.".
    At this point, you can keep looking for and adding more items. However, let's proceed to the next step of the purchasing process.
    Find and double tap on the "go to basket" button. This takes you to where you can review and update your basket. You can remove items you decide you don't actually want. You can also add items in. Look below your basket contents, and you'll find some ready recommendations. You'll also find a "go to checkout" button. Look a bit past that by flicking right, and you'll find a place where you can enter a discount code if you happen to have one. You would then double tap on the "apply code" button to have the code reduce your final price.
    Double tap on the "go to checkout" button. At this point, you are presented with an opportunity to create a Big Finish account. If you haven't already done this, I recommend you do so now by filling in the form that's presented. If you've already created an account, flick right over the form until you come to the "Log in", heading. Below this, you'll find a much shorter form asking for your email and password. If you've saved your password into iCloud Keychain while creating your account, once you double tap on the email field, your iPhone may ask if you want to "log in" with your name. Flick right and you'll discover your email. Double tap on this and be ready to look at your iPhone or touch your finger to the home button. The login information will be filled in for you. If this doesn't happen, simply fill it in yourself with the appropriate contents in each field. Once that's done, use the "log in" button, which can be found after the two fields.
    Now that you've logged in, you're ready to make your purchase. You will move onto the order confirmation and payment screen. Here, you must select a payment method. I tend to use PayPal. If you use your credit card, you'll need to fill in the fields which appear after double tapping that option. Depending on which payment method you use, there may be identification procedures to follow. PayPal lets me log in using a six digit verification code rather than a password. After I enter the six digits sent to me as a message, I can then double tap on the "pay now" button. If all goes well, this will complete my transaction. I will eventually be taken back to the Big Finish site having finished paying for my purchase.
    To hear what I've bought, I make use of the Big Finish app, which I've obtained from the app store. I open the app and log into my account. Once that's done, I can download any dramas I've purchased onto my phone. For anything from Big Finish, you actually do need to download the drama you want to hear so that it's on your device. Other apps such as the one from Graphic Audio will let you stream dramas rather than having to download them. This is fortunate given how large their dramas can be.
    Your purchase experience will differ from store to store. No two places are exactly alike. However, there are standards and conventions which will minimize the surprises you find in terms of the methods and skills you'll be using. I hope the example above will serve to give you a basic idea of what to expect an online purchasing experience will be like.
    I also hope I've awakened an interest in modern audio dramas. They have long been a cherished part of my life. My iPhone has made them so much easier to obtain, store and listen to wherever I might happen to be. There's plenty of fun and thought-provoking listening to be had out there. Hopefully, you'll take the time to look around all of these places. No matter what your first online purchase is, I hope the experience isn't too taxing and that you enjoy what you buy with your iOS device.

Using Social Media With Your iOS Device:
Social media platforms give people an opportunity to communicate freely with each other. Postings are largely readable by everyone and can be shared. People can indicate that they "like" or "favourite" posts and spread these liked postings to their own followers. Typically, such platforms are paid for by advertisers, hoping that their users will be exposed to ads while participating. Your iOS device can be a very handy and portable passport to the growing global village that is social media. To participate, you'll need to be competent in the use of VoiceOver. Also, you'll be making use of the app store to obtain the tools needed for your virtual travel. For the most part, you'll be able to use the very same apps sighted people do. Companies behind social media platforms are increasingly aware of their blind audience and of growing regulations regarding the need to make things accessible to people with disabilities. Sadly, not all of these companies particularly care about making participation easier for people with disabilities. Often, there are alternative apps which can prove advantageous. The result is that much of the time, with some purely visual exceptions, we are on a truly level playing field with those who can see. Keep in mind that there are often other choices if you don't like how the official apps we'll focus on work or present information. App developers with the skill to create alternatives have done so where possible. Not all developers are aware of accessibility, though, so be careful. I recommend you check in the app directory on AppleVis to read any accessibility thoughts that others who have tried the app you're interested in might have.
    This is an area where it has become both impossible and profoundly uninteresting for me to keep up with all of the changes which happen constantly. I've selected four currently popular forms of social media to cover in this guide, which serve as examples. Don't for a moment think that there aren't any other social media platforms. There are a bewildering array of them with their own customs, social atmosphere, methods and special features that differentiate them from other platforms. Making things even harder, the apps in this area are constantly being changed as these platforms fight for the attention of the public and advertisers. People have written books about them, so I won't reinvent the wheel here. My objective is to give you examples and information to allow you to explore with greater safety, ease, and confidence than I had when starting out.
    As someone who has come to deeply appreciate the phenomenon of social media despite its many problematic elements, I feel a keen sense of responsibility towards you, my readers. For some of you, much of this will be old hat, as you will long ago have begun participating using other devices. However, for some of you, your iOS device will be the very first opportunity you've had to explore this particular aspect of modern online life. You may not be fully aware of either the benefits or risks associated with participation. Through the time I take here, I hope to equip you to be good, safe, and helpful members of this new kind of community rather than its victims.
    Sadly, there are some truly deplorable people who use social media to bully, intimidate, and degrade others. Criminals make use of these platforms just as they use streets, telephone lines and other infrastructure to commit crimes. Keep this in mind when choosing what to reveal about yourself online. Also, keep it in mind while deciding what to believe about others.
Considering the Larger Picture:
Before we start looking at various platforms and apps, let's consider social media as a whole. While the various platforms like Facebook, Mastodon, and X have different characteristics, there are things they all share. I think it's a good idea to be certain we all understand what social media means, as well as the forces which shape it.
    In a nutshell, social media is a term that refers to an ever-expanding group of websites and applications set up to allow people to share content and participate in social networking. Facebook, blogs, email lists, X, and YouTube are all various forms of social media. Each service has a different focus. However, they all have contact between people as a core idea. Each platform offers mechanisms for indicating one's approval, disapproval, and spreading the postings of others. They will also allow people to follow particular posters whose content is of interest. Participants on these platforms are also able to respond to others with postings of their own. This results in ongoing threads of conversation which anyone may participate in. This allows especially popular content to "go viral" or spread massively through the general population on a given social media platform and often onto other platforms. For the purposes of this guide, I've chosen to focus mainly on four currently popular platforms. These are X, formerly known as Twitter, Mastodon, YouTube, and Facebook. Here is a brief overview of each of them, so you can compare.
    X focuses on shorter communications between anybody interested. It's like a casual conversation that anybody can join that never stops. Many celebrities have large numbers of followers. Public tweets can be up to 280 characters in length. People can use links to point their followers to longer material, images, videos, etc. X also allows for private messages between people who follow each other. Called direct messages or "DMs", these can be up to 10,000 characters long. This makes for a very useful combination. Public messages allow for questions or thoughts to be put out for comment and discussed in threads of manageable messages. Meanwhile, private conversations are useful for explaining things in greater depth when trying to offer assistance or explaining one's position fully to an individual. People might use X to ask how to do something using a short public message. Once they receive a helpful answer, they can engage in more extended private conversation with the helpful individual, which doesn't clutter up the timelines of other people who wouldn't be interested.
    YouTube focusses on video content. It allows anybody to have their own channel and post videos. Anyone can subscribe to your channel, like, dislike, share, or post comments on these videos. YouTube makes its money through advertising and from people who pay for the premium service. This allows them to watch videos without the frequent advertisements which interrupt people who don't pay for YouTube Premium. There is also special content restricted to people who pay for the premium service.
    Mastodon is an open-source alternative to corporate social media platforms. There is no central owner controlling it all. You are in total control of who can contact you. No algorithm forces sponsored content at you or recommends followers. People who run their own instances or servers are capable of moderating the content allowed on them. This puts all of the work on the shoulders of individuals who care enough about their own server and the larger connected fediverse of such servers enough to do this work. Individuals must do more work to find people who they wish to follow. For all this extra effort, you end up with a much nicer social environment which isn't driven by corporate interests. Beyond voluntary payment given to people for running and moderating content on different servers, nobody is directly paid for participation.
    Facebook focuses on friends and family and tries to be the thing you use to share videos, thoughts, and photos. It tries to be your one-stop shop for social interaction with interested groups ranging from family, to friends, to world-spanning communities sharing similar interests. People can create posts as long as they wish about their life happenings or matters of interest to them. They can also add videos and photos to these posts. People can comment on these posts as well as each other's comments. Frequently, this results in long conversations or threads growing out from initial posts. Facebook has expanded from this core concept to include apps and games that people can use on the platform. These tend to be visual in nature and inaccessible to blind users. These expansions have made Facebook a cluttered and busy environment to navigate.
    Keep in mind that these social media platforms are internet-based. They are used by people who go directly to the website of the service and do everything through their browser. Others might use applications created for computers running Windows, phones or tablets using Android, etc. This is generally referred to as being cross-platform. In the old days, you would pay a telephone company to connect you over long distance to people elsewhere in the world. You would pay for stamps to mail messages and packages to people. This still happens. However, social media offers the chance to communicate with the people who you care about at no cost. You can talk for hours to relatives or friends without paying a penny of long-distance charges. How is all this paid for?
    It all comes down to your attention and interests. Businesses are trying to make money and find out about people. Providing useful services such as the ability to communicate free of charge has proved a very effective means of getting peoples' attention and gaining information about them. They allow people to advertise on these services, which helps cover the costs. Your content and attention become the products sold to advertisers and other businesses by social media companies. Your participation draws your friends and family onto the service, where they themselves create content, encouraging others to join. Every so often, the content generated by people is so popular that those people can themselves make money through their use of social media. This requires harder work than many people surmise, and also requires very careful thought about how one uses social media.
    The trick to thriving for these companies is to maintain a balance between allowing advertising and use of data without alienating people who just want to socialize with each other. Fall off one way and there's no money. Fall off another and there is no user base. It is quite possible for these companies to fail. People don't talk about Myspace or MSN Messenger much anymore. Facebook has lost status as the cool place to be among younger people. Recently, it has also suffered some serious public relations damage and loss of trust due to the misuse of people's data. However, Facebook's overall popularity is such that it has so far survived these crises. Most social media platforms have suffered bad publicity. Blind users have seen the community once known as Audioboo entirely change and no longer support the kind of community they used to. The company simply couldn't sustain itself without changing direction. This has left many people feeling angry at the loss of a community of friends they once took for granted. Since we don't directly pay money for the maintenance of the communities that form on these social media platforms, they can seem more permanent than they actually are. The community you join may be less permanent than it feels. Take steps to make certain that the friendships you form will survive the collapse of the companies whose services made them possible. Have alternative methods of contacting friends you make online.
Why Go There At All: Positive Experiences with Social Media:
These days, there is a lot of talk of the dangers of social media. We hear all the time about cyberbullying, ruined lives, and ill-conceived remarks coming back to haunt people. The next major subsection will explore these dangers in some detail. First of all, though, I'd like to share some positive experiences I've had through my engagement with social media. I tend to consider social media to be a tool. You can use a hammer to build and repair things. However, you can also use it to smash in somebody's skull. Just because people might use a hammer for the latter purpose doesn't mean you should avoid hammers all your life. I advocate a reasonable, thoughtful approach to social media that isn't dominated by too much fear. In my judgement, there's frankly far too much good to experience through social media to let the bullies and criminals out there scare the rest of us off.
    What kind of good? For one thing, the only reason I've ended up happily married was thanks to a blog I still occasionally maintain. A mutual friend found my blog and decided to contact me. Our conversations led her to put me in touch with Sara, a woman I hadn't seen since we attended the Lake Joseph vacation resort during the same week one summer. Sara, who is now my wife, began listening to audio postings, and, eventually, we began talking. The rest is our happy mostly private history.
    These days, Facebook seems to be the point where past meets present. Thanks to its facilities for posting photos and videos as well as text, it has remained popular with groups of friends and families trying to keep in touch. While I was working on this guide, I was contacted by a friend from secondary school who wanted to arrange a reunion. That contact led to four of us school friends who hadn't ever assembled in person since those school days getting together for a meal and an evening's conversation. Facebook has also let me know about some family events and get-togethers over the years. People who recognized me in TV appearances I made as a child, or pictures of me included in articles or online postings, have contacted me via email or on various social media platforms. A number of interested strangers and people from school or university classes have heard me in podcasts or recognized me in a documentary about text-based adventure games called Get Lamp that I have participated in. They have also gotten in touch with me largely thanks to Facebook which makes it easier to track down people from one's past than other social media platforms tend to.
    For years now, I've been a member of social groups, and they've kept me informed about new apps, events, and other items of interest. I have also been able to share my knowledge and help other people get things done. I don't contend for a moment that friends made online can replace friends you interact with in the physical world. However, experience has shown me that people who completely devalue online relationships are willfully ignoring the possibility of a potentially helpful and meaningful form of connection. It really isn't an either/or choice. You can participate in the offline and online worlds. It's a matter of self-discipline and knowing when not to care.
    I have friends who travel a lot. Through Facebook, Mastodon and when I must, X, I have been able to keep in touch with them and find out how they're doing. More than that, I have occasionally been able to assist them in their adventures through sharing my own knowledge and experience.
    When I have needed help, I have frequently gotten it very rapidly after asking my questions on Mastodon or X. You can post a question publicly and then receive competent, detailed assistance through privately exchanged messages. I have often been able to provide timely assistance to people in the same manner.
    Elsewhere in this guide, I've examined the phenomenon of Internet radio in detail. This is a combination of social media with the ability to broadcast an audio or video stream live on the Internet. The community that can grow from this has been tremendously positive in my life.
    More broadly speaking, social media lets anybody spread information about events taking place very quickly. This has led to lives being saved and has changed how world history has unfolded. It has become much harder for those who, confident that nobody will know about it, would abuse their power or take advantage of people. Police forces have used social media to enlist the public's assistance, and this has saved many lives.
The Dangers of Social Media:
It helps if you consider these services to be actual public places you're going to. When we travel, we typically take precautions. I use my white cane to check ahead of me for obstacles. The echoes of its taps can also alert me to things around me. I make certain that what I carry with me is secure in pocket or pack. Typing on a keyboard, tapping on an iPhone, or uploading a video don't require much physical effort. There's an unreal quality about doing these things, which gives people a false sense of invulnerability. Beyond the larger concern of corporations misusing data they gather to operate and make money from their services, there are many personal pitfalls for users of social media platforms who aren't careful. The consequences of your online activities can have profound effects in your actual life and those of others. Think about what you share and who you share it with. Let's examine these dangers in greater detail.
Drama:
Like any other community, you'll encounter interpersonal relationships gone wrong in spectacularly public fashion. People can disagree angrily with each other even in ideal circumstances. When they're rushed, half distracted, and otherwise engaged as they often are while pontificating on social media, there is even more room for misinterpretation and a lack of thought before posting. This is often called "drama". One misunderstood remark can fill your timeline with absurdity as people join the fray with their own take on what was said and actually meant. You can find yourself sucked into it if you aren't careful and aware of what people say about you. It can feel like you're under siege as you deal with responses to a tweet or Facebook post you made that was taken completely out of the context in which you sent it.
    The best defence is to be consistent and take a moment before sharing to think about how it might be misconstrued. Provided you act responsibly on social media, I've found that people will know enough about you to prevent unflattering falsehoods from sticking. If someone ever accused me of murdering someone, they'd have to convince a tremendous lot of people who know me well enough to know I'd be extremely unlikely to do this. The same goes for other less serious but potentially hurtful things, such as being thought of as a racist. I consistently try to be as fair and open-minded as possible. People who saw a single instance when I failed to live up to these ideals or was misunderstood would run into many people who know me enough to set them right.
Digital is Permanent:
I was asked by a friend to start a blog on a platform he developed to be accessible for blind people. The timing for this seemed absolutely terrible, as I had just separated from my first wife. The only sort of blog I had any interest in writing was a personal one, rather than about a topic like access technology. Anybody who has lived through a separation that you know from the outset is effectively the end of a marriage can appreciate the emotional turmoil one goes through. The angry thoughts, dips into profound soul-searching as you evaluate everything against your inability to keep the most solemn and sober vow you've ever made ... I cringe at some of what I remember thinking at the time. However, before committing my thoughts to my blog, I always stopped and asked whether I was truly alright with them being out there in the digital world for anybody to read and potentially misuse. It actually made for wonderful therapy, as I had to step back and take a more objective look at my thoughts. As a result, I don't regret what's out there. Doubtless, there are messages I'd have second thoughts about, but overall, I've done a reasonably good job of staying clear of sharing damaging things.
    Unless you specify otherwise, anybody can see posts you make. Also, anyone can use what you say completely out of context for their own purposes. Do you believe in what you're saying enough to have it potentially be what you're remembered for? What you say today might very well come back to haunt you tomorrow or even years later. For instance, during the US presidential election held in 2016 while this guide was being conceived of, a very controversial and divisive man became President of the United States. Emotions ran very high and people have said some truly horrific things on various social media platforms. These are out there for anybody to see, including potential employers, friends, detractors, etc. Some remark made against Donald Trump on Facebook might conceivably end up preventing someone from Canada or the UK from visiting the US, since border guards have the right to search peoples' social media. What you share online can have offline consequences.
    Here are a few more examples that have stuck in my mind years after they've happened. There's the case of a young employee at Burger King, a fast food restaurant. After his shift one day, this young man and at least one friend who took the video, thought it would be funny to use one of the large industrial sinks for taking a bath in. This fellow washed himself in the sink while a friend made the video and posted it to YouTube. The video went viral, which basically means a whole lot of people saw it. This included the management of the restaurant, who promptly terminated his employment. It also has included potential employers who have elected not to hire him over the years. Something that might formerly have been one of those silly episodes you joke about with friends and family has stained this young man's reputation badly. There's nothing he can do to prevent the video from being available. It could haunt him for the rest of his days. He will forever be known as the Burger King Bather.
    Another case involved a lady who worked in public relations. She went on a vacation to visit relatives in South Africa. Before she left, she sent a message on X (formerly known as Twitter) to her followers:
    "Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!"
    During the long flight, that tweet was retweeted and commented on thousands of times. She was completely oblivious as her infamy spread. What she thought of as a harmless joke between online friends who knew her well enough to take it as a rather tasteless joke was being taken out of context and offending many thousands of people who she had no idea her words would ever reach. Those words were enough to utterly ruin her personal life and career in public relations. The incident is still often sited today, over four years later, as a clear illustration of what careless use of social media can do.
Cyberbullying:
What you share can be used against you by cruel and immoral people. There is no refuge from bullying done via social media. The whole idea of it is that you can participate in social media wherever you happen to be. Unlike previous generations of students, the advent of social media means that you're never safe from bullying. It will follow you home. Those photos or videos made while a relationship is fresh and enthralling may prove inescapable after a breakup occurs. Ill-considered remarks about others, or even one's particular taste in popular music or shows might one day prove ammunition for bullying. Even if you deleted your account from every social media platform on which you had been bullied, other people could still spread false or harmful information about you. People of all ages have had their lives turned into nightmares by total strangers who spot an opportunity for sadistic fun. This has driven some people to take their own lives.
    I hope the preceding paragraphs have given you an inkling of the possible negative aspects of social media that you may well encounter. Overall, my experience has been a very positive one. Part of the reason for that is the care I've taken to use these services responsibly. To be even better informed about these online dangers, I would urge you to read the following two books:
    Extreme Mean: Ending Cyber abuse at Work, School, and Home by Paula Todd
    So You've Been Publicly Shamed by Jon Ronson
Defensive Measures:
There are things you can do to minimize any damage you might experience through using social media. Different platforms will offer their own unique options and tools to guard your information, and you should take the time to become familiar with these. Meanwhile, I can offer you the following more general advice:
    It's all about keeping your own sense of intrinsic self-worth foremost in your mind. Also, know who the important people in your life are. What they think of you is far more critical than what people you've never even met in person think of you. Don't be unkind or dismissive to people who you associate with online, but don't let their feelings or problems swallow you up.
    All platforms will have options to block and unfollow people who cause you distress. Don't be afraid to use these options. Other people are equally free to do likewise to you. Remember, also, that your time is valuable. Don't feel that you are under any kind of obligation to become involved in drama if you would rather not be.
X:
https://x.com
    X, formerly known as Twitter, is a network that focusses on brief messages between people. Public messages are limited to 280 characters. Private messages can be up to 10,000 characters. Businesses use X for advertising, as do political leaders. Due to the limitation on the length of a single public tweet, conversations tend to be ongoing casual ones or very concise debates. People often try to fit everything into one tweet, which can lead to misunderstandings. There's a lot of "stream of consciousness" discussion, where people don't always think carefully about what they tweet. X is a great place to get technical help, since you can ask publicly in a short tweet and then exchange longer private messages with people you follow who also follow you.
    From a learning curve perspective, X is becoming more of a challenge for beginners. It used to be my first pick for a recommendation. However, things have changed markedly since Twitter rebranded to X after it was purchased. People who once helped to keep Twitter safe and accessible have been fired. As a direct consequence, there is much less of a chance that problems which people encounter in both areas of experience will be addressed quickly or effectively. Over time, as changes are made to X with the goals of making money and improving the experience for users without disabilities, people who require accessibility tools like VoiceOver are finding things becoming more difficult.
    Despite these changes, the core strengths of X remain present. The platform makes it easy to find out about and connect with people who have similar interests. The platform is still very widely used, so most news organizations, companies, celebrities, and others maintain a presence on the platform. I've had some truly excellent conversations and online community experiences thanks to X. Attending a virtual end-of-world party and observing how people reacted to Harold Camping's prediction of doomsday was absolutely fascinating. On X, you get to know people slowly over time as they post short messages about their lives, ask questions, etc. One day, you may suddenly realize you have become online friends and actually care about how things are going for someone you will likely never meet in person. X allows you to be more in tune with what's happening in the world in a very personal way.
    X started out as a website. You can still use it in your browser of choice rather than using an app at all. The site has been made accessible for screen readers. As further adjustments are made to the X app for iOS and to the platform over all, people might very well find that the website is easier to use than the app, or the other way around as time moves on. Once you've mastered how to surf the web using a browser, you should see if the website gives you a better means of navigating.
    The elimination of staff responsible for safety and accessibility has already had numerous frightful results. A good example is a journalist who works for the Toronto Star. She found herself personally attacked with private information, including her bank account credentials and home address, being made public by people angry with her published opinion columns. People at X have been so unsupportive that the person who controls her account is free to keep using it to cause harm while she has left the platform she once loved. People have little chance that false accusations or hate directed towards them will be addressed or removed. Personally, I've worked hard to block objectionable people and used all of the tools still available for people to protect themselves. The minutes of effort spent blocking and reporting spam and abusive comments that I've put in over the years probably add up to hours of unpleasant effort. Despite that extensive effort, I still come across far more hateful messages and material I don't wish to read in my timeline whenever I check on my X timeline these days. As a result, this is growing less frequent. Additionally, if you are unwilling to pay a monthly feee, you are now exposed to video and audio advertisements which are streamed to you as you used the service. This can make it harder to understand what you're reading if you rely on speech output.
    More recently, users of the X app have found that it has become necessary to double tap on a post to go into its area before you can read it. All that you hear as you flick through postings on your home timeline is the name of the account which the post was written with.
    The unfortunate changes made to X have yet to result in the utter meltdown that a lot of us predicted. The app is still mainly accessible. It remains a viable platform which is easy to join. Although people have sought alternatives, there are still enough users to make it worth continuing to have a presence on. The service recommends followers with similar interests or things in their profiles so it can be easier to find new similarly minded people to engage with. You just have to be willing to ignore the increased lack of safety measures or investment in accessibility and have a thick skin.
    To use the X service, you'll need to create an account. You can do this from within the app or from the website. You'll need to give X your email address and a password. You would also be wise to set up security by giving it your phone number so that if the need arises, it can provide you a code via text message that will verify your identity. If someone hacks your account and learns your password, this verification can help tremendously when attempting to recover control of your account.
The X App:
There are five tabs across the bottom of the app. From left to right, they are Home, Search and Explore, grok, Notifications, and Messages. At the top left of every tab screen, you'll find a button called User Menu. That provides access to a menu of things affecting the user experience. There are settings, access to your user profile, and many more options. This is followed by a heading informing you which tab you're in. This isn't the case in the Search and Explore tab, where there's a search field in place of a heading. To the right of that heading, things change depending on which tab you're in. Any controls or options will be found near the top left of a tab screen.
    The Home tab is where your timeline is displayed. This includes new tweets from people you have chosen to follow. You can flick left and right to have tweets read out to you. There are also recommended tweets and recommendations on people to follow. Near the heading at the top of the tab screen, you'll find a Compose Tweet button. Past that, you'll encounter your timeline, which can scroll infinitely. If you read a tweet you want to examine more closely, double tap on it with one finger. This opens the tweet and also shows you the thread that the tweet is a part of, including any replies made to it. You can also double tap with two fingers on a tweet. This is called a "magic tap" gesture, which can perform different functions in different apps as required. This overrides the normal function of this tap, which is to pause or resume playback. While in the X app, a two-finger double tap will activate a menu, giving quick access to commonly used X functions such as Reply, Retweet, Like, etc. Flick right through the options.
    To compose a tweet, double tap on the Compose Tweet button at the top of the Home tab. You will then be put in the tweet composition screen. There, you'll find an edit field to type your 280 characters. You'll be automatically placed in it. When finished typing, flick right, and you'll find all sorts of options to add photos, broadcast video, etc. The tweet button used to send your tweet into the world is found in the bottom-right corner of the composition screen.
    The Search and Explore tab is where you can look for people or tweets of interest. The rotor set to Headings is your friend here, as you can quickly get to different exploration facilities. There are headings for Today's Moments, Trends for You, a Connect button, and many more items of possible interest. You can't do any harm by looking around.
    The Notifications tab is where you'll find any mentions of you, as well as other notifications like tweets from people you want to be certain you see. Also, if anybody follows you, Likes or Retweets a tweet you send, etc., this will be recorded in the Notifications tab. It's a good idea to check every so often for new notifications. At the top left of the tab, you can find the Notifications Settings button, where you can customize what you're notified about.
    To send a message, you can use the New Message button at the top left of the tab screen. You will be placed in the area where you specify who the message is sent to. You can use the search field or flick right through an alphabetical list of your followed Twitter contacts who follow you back. You may send private messages to these contacts. Otherwise, you must communicate with public messages until you follow each other. Private messages are limited to 10,000 characters. This can be tremendously helpful when clearing up misunderstandings or offering technical help.
    Once a conversation has started, you can double tap on a tweet with one finger to enter that thread, whether it's a private one in the Messages tab or a public one. At that point, you're examining the whole thread. Flick left or right through the tweets. There will be a text field near the bottom right where you can add to the thread by replying. Double tapping on a tweet within a thread will focus specifically on that tweet and any replies to it.
    You can easily get back out of these threads. In the top-left corner, there will always be a Back button. In other circumstances, like when you're in the composition screen and want to leave it, look at the top left for a Close button. You're never trapped anywhere. There's always a Cancel, Back, or Close button at the top left to get you back to the main screens of X.
    The latest addition is the "grok" tab. This gives people who pay X to subscribe for extra perks access to an artificial intelligence called Grok. I have no idea how useful this feature is. Nor do I have any plans to pay a cent to the company in order to find out.
Mastodon:
https://joinmastodon.org
    This social media platform was created as an alternative to ad supported algorithm-driven networks. It was designed to be open source. This means that anybody can contribute to and examine the software programming. It is also decentralized. Instead of a collection of central servers, anyone who wants to put in the time can run their own server or instance, as they're often called. An instance is like an email provider. People can choose to create an account on any instance open to the public. They are able to migrate to a different instance if they later decide that its rules and facilities are a better fit for their needs.
    No single individual or company can wreck Mastodon as has happened with X. Communities and people who want a safe and respectful environment are free to create that. Also, third-party apps which are made for Mastodon can't be rendered useless to their users by a company. Free from corporate pressures and advertising, this makes for a far better environment in all sorts of ways.
    Having no system pushing people and content at you does put more work on individuals who want to be found and followed. Once you've created an account on a server, you should create a profile. This is what you want potential followers of your posts to know about you in order to decide whether to contact or follow you. Hashtags are a common feature in Mastodon profiles. Basically, it's a hash mark or number sign followed immediately by a word. Multiword hashtags are possible, but there can't be any spaces between the words. Often, people make hashtags out of their interests. I like to read and also am interested in technology. Therefore, my profile contains these words with the hashtag or number sign symbol, the shifted number three, immediately before them. This increases the chances that someone searching for users who share my interests will find my profile. Some sentences about yourself an a hashtag list of your interests should serve you well.
    In addition to a profile, most people will also do an introductory post where they introduce themselves and perhaps expand on information found in their profile. Over time, people will find your posts and may decide to follow you. You always have the option to block them, follow them back, etc. You can decide to protect your account so that people need to request to follow you, and you must approve their request before they can follow you.
    While users have ultimate say in who can follow them and how public their posts are, much of the Mastodon experience is shaped at the level of the instance the user chooses to join. The individual or group who provide each instance can decide what rules people must follow. A major difference between instances is how many characters an individual post can contain. Most instances have rules around things like hate speech. Some might insist on people discussing topics which might offend others put content warnings on their posts where appropriate. It's purely up to the people in charge of the instance you join to enforce their rules. There is no higher level of authority.
    Instances are linked together into what is known as the fediverse. You don't have to belong to the same instance as someone else in order to follow them and exchange posts. Think of instances like email providers. I use Gmail and can freely correspond with friends using Hotmail. Nothing stops people from creating instances where hateful and offensive content is encouraged. However, such instances will find themselves blocked off and isolated from other instances wanting to foster a safer more welcoming environment. I have yet to come across a truly hateful post in all my time on Mastodon.
The Mastodon App:
The Mastodon app for iOS has been well-designed. Clearly, accessibility was a consideration from the beginning. Although not as feature rich as alternative apps found in the app store for using Mastodon, the basic app is free and sufficient for most casual users.
    There are five tabs across the bottom. These are, from left to right, "Home", "Search and Explore", "Compose", "Notifications" and "Profile". The "Home" tab is where you'll find your timeline with messages from newest to oldest. Each message is preceded by its creator's username, how long ago the message appeared, and then the post itself. There doesn't seem to be any way to sort these posts into alternative order by various criteria. 
    Rotor actions let you easily reply to, boost, follow links in, and favourite posts. Double tapping on a post would put you in the thread, which you can add to via the reply button found at the top just before the first post.
    The "Search an Explore" tab lets you do precisely that and find people who share your interests. You'll find a search field as well as buttons for browsing people, hashtags, news, and "for you". Hashtags are important on Mastodon. People use them to indicate what they're interested in. Type a name, hashtag, or keywords into the search field. Alternatively, you can double tap on the Posts, Hashtags, News and For You buttons and see what appears. This gives you the ability to see what's trending and popular at the moment. The News button focuses in on accounts from news organizations who have decided to have a presence on Mastodon. The For You button takes you to a list of accounts which seem to match with your interests as determined by what you've previously indicated by your actions on Mastodon, such as the accounts you've followed or hashtags you've searched. You'll need to do more work searching for and finding people to follow. However, nothing you aren't interested in will get pushed at you. 
    The Compose tab is where you can create posts of your own. Double tapping on the tab will put you automatically in the edit field, ready to start typing or pasting. You can use the button to the left of the edit field to set your post's privacy level. Public is the default. Meanwhile, to the right of the edit field, you'll find other options to add emoji, add a pole for people to participate in, put a content warning on your post if it's offensive or controversial, etc. Nothing stops you from posting links if it suits you. How many characters you have per post depends on the instance you decided to create an account on. You can attach pictures and add alt text to describe them for blind followers. If you go past your character limit, you cannot publish your post until you rectify this.
    The notifications tab is where you can view and act on any notifications you receive. You'll be notified when people reply to your posts, follow you, mention you, etc. You can choose which things you want to be notified of in the settings found on the home or Profile tabs. One of the areas in those settings is called notifications.
    The Profile tab at the far right is where you can edit and create your profile. This is also where you can manage which hashtags you intend to follow, manage your lists of people you follow and those who you allow to follow you. You can also access the app settings, create an avatar photo which people can see, etc. You have a lot of latitude crammed into that tab.
    This should be enough to get you started using the Mastodon app. It's freely available in the app store. For a far more customizable premium experience, I recommend people try an app called Mona. I've been very impressed with its ease of use, accessibility and all of the abilities it gives you to make your Mastodon experience uniquely suited to your needs.
YouTube:
This popular service makes it possible for anyone to create their own channel where they can publish videos they create which don't violate intellectual copyright and other laws. You can use all sorts of different cameras and gear to produce and edit these videos before you upload them to YouTube. Alternatively, you can do it all with just your iPhone, the YouTube app, and a tripod or stand to keep your iPhone's camera steady.
    People have created videos about pretty much everything. There are videos about various products, game reviews, videos demonstrating how to do things, amateur horror series, video blogs about life experiences, and much more. If people attract a high enough viewer count, they can make money from their content as YouTube can put advertisements in the content which non-subscribers must watch in order to see the rest of the video.
    You don't need to create videos in order to participate. Many people, myself included, have never created a video. However, people are able to leave written comments about the videos. They can also indicate whether they like to dislike them, share links to them, and choose to subscribe to the channel of their creators. Subscribing to a YouTube channel doesn't incur a fee. It simply causes you to be notified of new videos a creator makes and have their content fed into your personal YouTube timeline.
    It is possible to get a more premium YouTube experience free of ads and with other perks by paying for a YouTube premium subscription. One of my favourite perks such payments grant you is the ability to play YouTube videos and have them continue playing in the background while you use other apps. This lets me take notes while listening to videos about new features introduced by Apple. I might hear a video about an influencer's top twenty horror books of all time and create a list of any which interest me in the Notes app while doing so. I might then write a comment about whether I agree or disagree with conclusions drawn in the video. Thanks to YouTube, I have some idea what's actually inside my iPhone from hearing videos from a channel called JeryRigEverything. I learned what it's like to design and manufacture a backpack from a channel called Nomads Nation. Through another channel called John and Heather's Dementia Journey, I've gotten glimpses into what life is like for a loving husband who finally reached a point of moving his wife who suffers from dementia into a care facility. I know what it sounds like to be on a cargo ship at sea, be in an emergency room during the pandemic, and countless other situations I'm unlikely to ever be in personally. I believe I'm a more thoughtful fellow for all that. It can be enlightening to read comments made about the videos and be able to ask questions of their creators.
    Of course, like other forms of social media, YouTube can be addictive. It's easy to while away many hours watching video after video. Don't think for a moment that I haven't ever done that. Also, there can be cruelty. There are videos which express and encourage hateful behaviour. Additionally, people can be unbelievably cruel with their comments about videos. You should go in prepared for that reality. Unlike other social media platforms, YouTube has rules governing both videos being created and comments. Users can report bad behaviour and action may be taken. Creators of videos and offensive users have been banned. Occasionally, this happens through artificial intelligence rather than human moderators. Find out more by going to:

The YouTube App:
I've had the YouTube app on my iPhone for a very long time now. Google owns this platform, and they have done an impressive job making the app accessible using VoiceOver. There's a whole-lot of content and plenty of settings and options, making for busy full screens to navigate. We won't be doing an exhaustive tour of this app. There's frankly too much to cover in that manner. However, I'll share some aspects which I've found important and give an overview of what you'll find in each tab. There is often more than fits on one screen, so scrolling through with the vertical bar down the right side or with three fingered swipes up and down will be something you do a lot.
    There are five tabs across the bottom of the app. They are Home, Shorts, Create, Subscriptions and You. By far, I spend most of my time on the Home tab. It contains the content which YouTube's algorithm thinks will possibly interest you. This is your YouTube feed or timeline. Before you get to that timeline, you'll find a bunch of useful things at the top of the screen. This includes a search button which lets you get to a search field where you can type in what interests you. You'll also find a "notifications" button, which takes you to any notifications about new videos made by creators whose channels you follow or whose videos you've liked. A series of other buttons let you filter videos by subject. I often use one called "New to you" which clears away any previously watched content.
    Your timeline consists of videos, with the name and length of each video followed by a button to go to the channel of its creator. There's also a button to take other actions, including reporting a video for rules violations. Double tap on a video's title to start watching it. There are headings on the timeline, but they're too far apart to make use of the headings rotor. You're better off scrolling with three fingered swipes up and down to get near where you want to be. There's a lot of clutter, including images and other things which can be found between videos. Accessible, but somewhat unwieldy.
    Once you go to a channel, you can find tabs letting you focus on videos, playlists, and other aspects of the channel. Double tap on the tab which interest you and explore. Playlists are related collections of videos. You can play them sequentially, jump to specific ones, etc. Take the time to subscribe to channels of interest. It's easy to forget about them if no new content appears for a while.
    After double tapping on a video to play it, new control buttons appear. There's a button to play and pause. To the left and right of that are buttons to rewind or fast-forward by ten second intervals. To the left and right of those two buttons are ones letting you skip to the previous or next video. You'll find a new but†on at the very top left of the screen, letting collapse the video so that the timeline is back taking up most of the screen. The video is still open at the very bottom, where you can find a button to close it, as well as a play/pause button.
    Some videos are live events and there'll be a chat window which appears letting people type into the communal text chat available for people watching the event. My church makes their services available online in this way. If I'm unable to attend in person, it's nice to have this option.
    The Shorts tab is where to find very short videos typically lasting seconds. Creators can briefly show a product or aspect of what they do, and people can then go to their channel to find more lengthy content. I have no use for these shorts and think they do nothing but cause clutter.
    The Create tab will open a dialogue box with all sorts of creation tools. The record button is on the bottom right. You can choose the recording mode, including live-streaming. You can add audio tracks if you wish. Having never created a video myself, I recommend that you find a mentor who has. Also, be certain to check the help available in the YouTube settings. You'll find these in the "You" tab at the far right. The settings button is near the top of that tab. The help and policies can be found at the bottom of all the settings. There are many totally blind content creators.
    The Subscriptions tab lets you manage the channels you've selected to subscribe to. It also makes for an easy way to get to those channels directly rather than using the buttons by videos posted to them. You'll be able to see which channels have new content. You can also unsubscribe from channels. So far, I haven't had any reason to do this. I appreciate the ability to drill down into channels I haven't checked in on for a while and quickly see what's new.
    The "You" tab is where you can manage your own channel if you choose to become a creator. You can also access the settings and help in those settings. Another button allows you to manage your account with YouTube. You can turn on incognito mode, which protects your privacy. I haven't made much use of this tab other than to use the settings. However, if you want to become a YouTube creator and post videos, I would encourage you to take the time to poke around this area and know what's available.
Facebook:
Facebook is a very popular social media platform that has become extremely well known and widely used. People can send messages, talk, post text or video updates to their own personal news feeds to keep friends and family informed and write comments on each other's posts. There are many games and apps specifically written for Facebook to increase social interaction and use of the service. This makes Facebook quite an expansive and complex service to become familiar with. It's trying to be the one-stop shop for social interaction. In doing this, it has become rather complex. If you can master Facebook to the point where you're comfortable with it, you should have a pretty easy time of most other things you might choose to attempt on your iOS device.
    Facebook sells data it collects as users take advantage of the Facebook service. People indicate approval of things like videos and messages by "liking" them. This quickly gives Facebook a great deal of information about the preferences, interests, and habits of its users. The data is useful to many corporations. In effect, you are the product. Businesses also take advantage of its popularity and extensively advertise on the service. The more Facebook can succeed in constantly keeping people using their service, the more money is made through advertising and sponsorships.
    Overall, Facebook is currently doing a good job of making its app and website accessible to blind users. They're very aware of their blind audience and eager to be known as an accessible service. Recently, they've started adding automatic descriptions to photos using artificial intelligence. You can hear them as you come to them in your news feed. To learn more about accessibility on Facebook, check out www.facebook.com/accessibility.
    Facebook has decided to split the many things you can do on Facebook into two separate apps. Think of the Facebook app as your public presence. You can look at peoples' news feeds, or post messages or videos to your own news feeds, comment on what other people post, etc. You can also interact with any Facebook groups you're a part of.
    Facebook Messenger is for more private communication between you and your Facebook contacts. It's quite a full-featured alternative to the far less complex messages app provided by Apple. Now, we will look at each of these apps in turn. However, be aware that they have undergone radical changes as Facebook seeks to define and differentiate itself from competing social media platforms. These apps may change at any point in time. The best overall advice I can give is to explore thoroughly, so you're aware of your options.
The Facebook App:
As of late 2019, there are six tabs across the bottom of the screen. These are News Feed, Friends, Your Profile, Groups, Notifications, and Facebook Menu. All of these are important to become familiar with. Rather than exhaustively describing everything in each tab, I'll give an overview of what you can do there. You can take time to look around using VoiceOver and figure the specifics out as you need them.
    News Feed
    You start out in the News Feed tab. Here, you can view your feed as well as the feeds of your friends. Any stories, photos, videos, etc. can be interacted with. Flick left and right through the various posts. A post will be automatically fully read without you having to do anything as you flick onto it. But wait. To read a post more carefully, double tap on it with one finger. This lets you read it, making use of VoiceOver gestures. Also, you can see how other people have commented and reacted to the post. Double tapping with two fingers takes you to some quick ways to react to the post. Additionally, flicking up or down on a post will go through a menu of options. Have VoiceOver Hints enabled so that you can take advantage of all the helpful hints Facebook has included. Near the top left, there are buttons for using your camera, searching through feeds to find items of interest, and much more.
    Friends
    This tab is all about responding to friend requests made by others, as well as finding people you may wish to request friendship with. You'll find a People You May Know heading, beneath which is a list of people Facebook considers it likely that you might want to interact with. Near the top, you'll find buttons to filter requests and who appears within this tab. For instance, you may remove people from the group Facebook suggests you may want to be friends with. Invitations to groups or events may also appear in this tab.
Your Profile:
Here is where you can create and edit your Facebook profile. This consists of information about you that others may or may not be able to see, depending on your privacy choices. You can use your device's camera or a photo in your collection to add to your profile. This is a common practice among sighted people and will allow them to recognize you more easily.
    There are different sections to your profile, including public information that everyone can see, plus many other things. You can do far more than simply write a brief autobiographical description. Adding in details like your home city, schools attended, and other details will let other people who you might wish to contact find your profile more easily. It will also give Facebook's friend-finding algorithm more information to work with, resulting in better recommendations. Be certain that you think through what information you reveal to people. The options to take firm control of this are there, but few people take the time to learn what they can do in this area. Remember that your profile is not the same as your account, which is always private.
Groups:
In addition to friends and family, Facebook also offers extensive facilities for groups of people who share common interests. The Groups tab is where you can discover groups to join, create them, and invite others to join. You can post private messages to group members that nobody outside the groups may read. Additionally, you may start group chats and post events that others may indicate whether they can attend.
    Personally, I don't do a lot with groups. I belong to one open to those who attended a school for the blind. They schedule chats that take place on Skype, as well as hold group conversations about topics of common interest. There is also a group that was started as an offshoot of a show on CBC Radio called "Now or Never". Its purpose is to allow members to encourage and help each other with various dilemmas and problems in life. The name of this group is "You Got This".
Notifications:
This tab contains any notifications awaiting your attention. These can be any posts made to groups you're a member of, event invitations, and reminders from various apps connected to Facebook you may be using. You can flick left and right through the various notifications and double tap on them to interact with them and read more closely. This opens up any previous related notifications. From there, you can flick left or right to view different notifications related to the most current one you double tapped on. Flicking up or down while on a notification gives you a menu of options such as liking, commenting, etc.
    Notifications all gathered in one tab like this are especially useful if you don't check Facebook regularly. Finding Facebook somewhat cumbersome, I fit squarely in this category of people who grudgingly pop in occasionally. The Notifications tab has alerted me to a good many events and other things that I might easily have missed without it. This holds particularly true for inquiries, messages, and other things directed at me personally.
Facebook Menu:
This is a very packed place. You can flick through the options and also use the rotor to flick between headings. Also, you can do three-finger scrolls up or down to quickly move through the contents of the tab. This area lets you access all sorts of otherwise hidden places and settings on Facebook. There are options and things in here including apps, games, shortcuts, and more. The most important thing to be aware of is the settings. These let you customize many aspects of how Facebook behaves.
The Facebook Messenger App:
Facebook wanted to have an app that competed directly with other messaging apps from other social media platforms. It, therefore, created the Facebook Messenger app for audio and video communication between closely associated groups like friends and family or business employees. The original Facebook app focusses on more widely shared communication.
    There are three tabs across the bottom. They are Chats, People, and Discover.
Chats:
Everything in terms of controls is at the top of this tab. The Settings button is at the top left. You will also find a button called Camera, which lets you share photos. A search field lets you look for specific users or words within chats. There's a New Chat button, allowing you to start a chat. The rest of the tab contains any chats you may be involved in. They are in chronological order based on the latest communication. Explore the Settings button contents. There are all kinds of ways to configure Facebook Messenger.
    While you're in a conversation, you have numerous options. Near the top of the screen, you'll find options to initiate audio or video calls with other participants. You'll find messages in a chronological list going left to right, with the right end being the most recent. After these messages, there are more options like an audio composer, media picker, camera access, and others. There are also options like waving at other participants. It's a busy space in terms of options.
People:
This tab is for dealing with all of your contacts. Also, you can add new contacts. Every option is at the top of the screen. There are buttons to change your view between all contacts and those active on Facebook. You'll also find a search field to quickly find the person you want. Below these buttons, you'll find a complete list of your contacts in alphabetical order. The rotor is your friend again, since you can set it to headings and flick up and down between letters. Double tap on the contact you want, and options appear for contacting or editing the contact.
    This tab is where you can block people who bother you on Facebook Messenger. To accomplish this, open a conversation with the person you want to block. Double tap on their name at the top of the conversation, and you'll find an option to block them. Blocking someone in Facebook Messenger stops them from sending messages, but is different from blocking them on Facebook. To achieve that, use the Facebook app. It is also possible to unblock messages should circumstances change between you and someone who has bothered you.
    Discover
    This tab concerns itself with activities and advertisements that you might choose to take part in. There are all kinds of games. Also, businesses have Facebook pages that may show up here. This is particularly likely if your friends have expressed interest in what's on offer. Many of these will be more visual in nature. However, people who are interested may find this tab to be worth exploring.
    There is a button called For You near the top as well as one called Recent. Below are a whole bunch of links to pages, apps, and games.
Meetings With Zoom:
https://zoom.us
    This might be difficult to believe given the past couple of years, but the Zoom Cloud meeting platform was originally built for business people to conduct secure and orderly meetings on. Thanks to the pandemic, Zoom might now equally be regarded as a social platform helping all sorts of people to connect with each other. In fact, it has been such a big part of my social experience during the pandemic that I've chosen to include my subsection about Zoom in the larger social media section rather than productivity software.
    There are a number of accessible meeting platforms. Microsoft Teams is another popular example known to be accessible on iOS for VoiceOver users. For this guide, I will be focussing on Zoom in this subsection. Given its excellent accessibility and rise to social prominence, it seemed the best choice as an overall example. If you can master Zoom, you'll find many online events will be open to you. Skills used in Zoom meetings are transferable to other meeting platforms. Just keep in mind that they'll have different control setups and approaches to the same task of connecting people productively.
    You don't need a Zoom account to join a meeting. Simply entering the meeting information will suffice. Most commonly, you can simply click on a link and be guided through what you may need to do. If it's your first time using the Zoom app, you may need to give permission for it to make use of cameras and microphones. However, if you'll be using Zoom regularly, I recommend creating a basic Zoom account. It doesn't cost anything. You can create the account from within the app, or do it on the Zoom website. People seem to find the website account creation experience easier. Once you log in using the Zoom Cloud Meetings app, it will remember your credentials and put your name in automatically when you join meetings. You also get a personal meeting ID number. Also, you will be able to create meetings and invite others to join you.
    A basic account lets you have meetings of any length between yourself and one other person. This can be a useful way to freely connect with people to touch base, give tech help, etc. For meetings with three or more people, you are limited to forty minutes before the meeting ends. If you wish, you can pay a monthly or annual subscription for a Zoom Pro or Business account. These provide more meeting capacity and other features, letting you host larger groups of people. There are also add-ons such as audio conferencing which can be added to further enhance what Zoom will do for you. For most smaller groups which aren't businesses, the Pro account should be sufficient. This lets up to 100 people participate at a time in meetings, which can be up to 30 hours long.
    I'll leave it to you to explore the various possibilities Zoom offers to people wanting to host conversations, large and small. In this subsection, we'll focus on what you should know in order to participate well in Zoom meetings using the Zoom Cloud Meetings app. Signing up for your account will be the first thing to do. For this, you'll need to be familiar with a web browser like Safari. Nothing says you need to sign up for a Zoom account using your iPhone. You can use a computer to do this if you feel more comfortable. The form to create an account is quite accessible. Once you've completed and submitted it, you'll receive an email with a link in it to verify that you do indeed want the Zoom account linked with that email. Once you've verified your email, the account will be active. You can then open the Zoom Cloud Meetings app and log into your new account.
    Let's explore the Zoom app while you're not in a meeting. There are four tabs across the bottom. At the far left is "meet and chat". This tab lets you join and create meetings. Unless you've paid for a Zoom room, the "start chat" button near the top of the tab won't be active. However, buttons to join, create and schedule meetings will be available and can be used. Simple double tap the option you want and then flick right to find any edit fields to be filled in or controls to set. You shouldn't have any trouble if you have a basic grasp of web browsing and using VoiceOver.
    The next tab is "Meetings". At the very top, you'll find controls letting you start a personal meeting and invite people to it. There's also a refresh button near the top of the tab. That button will refresh the list of any upcoming meetings, which occupies the rest of this tab. Double tap on a meeting in the list to reach a menu of options for that meeting. The very last one on the menu is the option to join. However, you'll also find buttons letting you change the date and time or edit the name of the meeting.
    The "Contacts" tab comes next. You can add and manage contacts here. It's possible to connect your list of phone contacts to your Zoom contact list. Alternatively, you can keep the list of contacts you want to communicate via Zoom with separate from your other contacts. I haven't made any use of this tab whatsoever.
    The final tab at the bottom right is called "settings". Here is where you can configure the app. The first button in this tab lets you create an account or sign in with an account you have already made. Enter your email and password, or do whatever procedure is required. I have my Zoom app set to let me use Face ID to log into my account. Once logged in, that first button in the "settings" tab will be labelled with your email. There are buttons in that account area to update your password, set your location and other things. Many of these won't be useable for people using basic accounts, but may work if you've paid for a pro account.
    There are other groups of settings in the tab. You'll find buttons you can double tap to reach areas about meetings, chats, contacts, and general settings. You can also create Siri shortcuts. There's quite a bit of depth to the Zoom app. I encourage you to look through all the options in Zoom settings, even though you don't really need them for basic participation. One thing you should do in the account area is set your display name. This will automatically be used when you join meetings. I use my real name. However, nothing says you have to.
    Once you've joined a meting or chat, none of those tabs are accessible. Another set of controls pops up for use while in meetings. At the bottom of the screen, there-are three buttons. These are "share content", "participants", and "more". Above these buttons, you'll find buttons letting you leave the meeting, get meeting information, start or stop sharing your video, mute or unmute your audio. People who set up meetings can decide whether people start with audio or video started or stopped. You should also know that hosts of meetings can take actions such as muting all participants, rejecting unruly guests, etc. Screen content can also be shared. However, this doesn't seem to be accessible to VoiceOver as far as I've experienced.
    Once you double tap the "share content", "participants" or "more" buttons, you'll be taken to a set of options which pertain to that button. The participants button will let you look at a list of all participants and also gives access to other options. You'll use this button often. The same is true for the "more" button. That gives you a series of options including making visual gestures, accessing the text chat, and much more. While chatting via text, you can still hear any audio proceedings which might be happening.
    Sometimes, hosts of meetings will set up breakout rooms. These allow for smaller, separate conversations to take place during larger meetings. Such rooms are also a common feature during Zoom conferences you might attend.
    Zoom is one of these popular cross-platform products which you could probably write a book about all on its own. In fact, this has been done. Sadly, that book which was so very helpful at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic has been rendered obsolete due to this rapid continuing evolution. Zoom achieved explosive growth, which they initially weren't at all prepared for. Gaming groups, school classes, friends, and families all jumped onboard Zoom when lockdowns started. As a result, Zoom had to quickly become more robust and secure. I hope that this subsection gives you enough of a grasp of Zoom so that you can feel comfortable participating in any conversations, events, meetings, or classes offered on the service. Many blindness organizations such as the CNIB continue to offer opportunities for pier supported learning and discussion via Zoom. These events can be very useful, particularly for people who are new to this technology or coming to grips with vision loss. Perhaps, you might even host your own online events.
Social Media Conclusions:
As with so many things, the pandemic has left its mark on social media platforms and what we think of it overall. Efforts to satisfy our need for connection with friends and loved ones during lockdowns have thrown developers of these platforms into high gear and given them the resources to thrive. People have also become far more aware of the systemic problems inherent in how these platforms are economically driven to maximize attention, even at the cost of cohesive society. I'm very hopeful that this mass exposure has planted the seeds for positive changes going forward. Many people have witnessed the damage that careless words and intentional attempts to divide people can result in. At the same time, people have also directly experienced many of the positive aspects of social media, as it helped keep us in contact with those we care about in a safe manner.
    For blind people, having many conferences, work opportunities and public events go virtual has been paradoxically liberating and empowering. I have attended several large events, including the virtual version of the Word On The Street festival, which I was once able to attend in person. I must say that it was far less expensive and easier to navigate independently as a virtual event. I thoroughly enjoyed the discussions, but must confess to missing that irreplaceable sensation of being with so many people who shared my love for books.
    I think it's safe to say that social media will be a large presence either indirectly or directly in modern life for the foreseeable future. Even if you don't participate in it yourself, you would be hard-pressed to avoid being affected by others whose thoughts, assumptions, and opinions have been affected by discussions on social media platforms. To help you decide how best to engage with social media, or whether you actually want to, here are some more of my own experiences with it:
    Every so often, as a single unemployed fellow, you find yourself facing a long holiday weekend when it seems like everyone else has people to be with and somewhere to go. That was the case for me on the Thanksgiving weekend of 2010. Three days of everyone else being busy and elsewhere. Three days of absolutely alone time with no reason to go anywhere. For people leading hectic, busy lives, that's often described as paradise. If, however, you feel like you've tried absolutely everything within your capabilities to contribute meaningfully, but nobody seems to care, that kind of empty long weekend can be soul crushing. No amount of solitary entertainments can fill the gaping hole left by having no friends or a partner to hang out with. If you're lucky, they might be engaging enough for you to forget your solitude for a while.
    By Sunday evening, I had reached the point where there was literally nothing else to do but look in on social media before turning in. I decided to check Twitter on the off chance that someone who I followed had actually tweeted something interesting. That happened surprisingly more often than I initially thought it would. Being on X, you would learn about the lives and concerns of the people you followed, a little bit at a time. Eventually, much like dust in a room, these little pieces of thought, ranging from what they had to eat for lunch to some casual observation typed out just after the thought was formed, would build up over time into something quite meaningful. And then, one day, you'd come across another tweet from a follower and realize that you truly cared about how this person you had never met in real life was doing. You found yourself responding and making an effort to express your own thoughts or cheer him or her up or share a hopefully helpful bit of knowledge.
    My friends had basically press-ganged me into getting with the times and joining up. I was still pretty skeptical about how meaningful one could possibly be when tweets could only be 140 characters long. Looking through the timeline of tweets from people I followed, I was rewarded. Heather, a friend I knew back in secondary school, tweeted that the first trapped Chilean miner was coming up. I checked the timestamp on the tweet. It was only a couple of minutes old.
    A group of miners had been trapped underground for weeks by a collapse. I had been fascinated by the unfolding crisis in the news. However, it had reached a point where no new developments seemed likely for months as people tried to figure out how to rescue the men. I didn't know that a rescue was at all imminent. Thanks to Heather's announcement, I was able to tune into CP24 in time to hear the first miner be freed. Hearing that happen was nothing short of incredible. You could feel the triumph of the Chilean crowd as the first man was lifted from the cave in a specially built rescue capsule. I stayed up late to hear the first few get pulled out. I had been reflecting a lot on how disconnected and fragmented we were all becoming; wondering if there was really any hope for me finding a genuine life partner at all, starting to doubt whether my projects would ultimately do anything other than pass lonely time and make me feel productive. The latest episode of Spark on CBC Radio had gotten me thinking about how little people seem to watch in common other than perhaps sports. We all seem to be on our own little islands. And then, Twitter, plus a friend I'll likely never physically meet again, got me on the same page as the rest of the world. My timeline was suddenly filled with cheerful tweets as people discussed the events happening on my own TV and so many millions of others. Thanks to Twitter, I could join in this conversation as readily as anyone else.
    Hearing the rescue was just what I needed to put things in perspective. For a while, at least, it restored and recharged my sense of patience and hope. That's a big part of the connective power of social media. After that Thanksgiving long weekend, I've never been able to think of Twitter with quite the same sense of derision. Through it, I was profoundly moved. I was sad to find it becoming a more hostile place after it was bought by a billionaire and became X. Had it become a kind of public utility not driven by corporate greed and stripped of all of its guardrails, I might never have looked for better virtual places to be. Although I still find TWitter, or X as it's now called, to be a useful source of information, I don't go there for discussion anymore. There's just too much junk and nastiness to dig through these days.
    Occasionally, we get so buried in our own misery that we lose a proper sense of perspective. You get so absorbed in your own life that all else fades. Before that Sunday night, I wasn't all that impressed by Twitter, Facebook, and the like. So much of what was posted seemed so very trivial. However, as time passed, that powerful experience became one of many. When the Fukushima disaster happened, I found out that a Japanese follower I had was stranded across the city from his wife. The phone lines being jammed, it took quite some time before he could even find out that his wife was thankfully alive and safe. Another follower living in Egypt was caught up in the events in Tahrir Square, which toppled the dictatorship. Others have tweeted about tornados, fires, and other disasters.
    Equally important, you get a sense of the good things that happen to people all over the world. I've found real pleasure in finding out how Christmas unfolded for people in countries in different time zones. All at once, Christmas has new cheer and longevity as I can read about what other people experience, the gifts they receive and the people they enjoy their holiday with. That expansive awareness has done much to addd vitality to the occasion. People also love sharing their happy discoveries, painful puns, and so much more. Occasionally, you might know something that can make a big difference to someone. I have experienced this particular joy many times now. Personally, I find this incredibly helpful when it comes to keeping a healthy perspective of my own life.
    I have also experienced some lighter forms of negative social media experience. People have taken remarks I've made completely out of context. Moments of flippancy on my part have given unintended offence to people. Of course, there is the ceaseless deluge of disagreeable spam from advertisers and others with unkind political agendas, to put it mildly. Keeping a degree of emotional detachment is a very helpful skill if you want to avoid getting sucked into often circular, hopeless arguments with people who seem to live for troublesome drama. The best and worst of us is on full display. Despite all that roughness, I, for one, plan to stick around and try to do some digital good. I hope that you'll keep a level head, take sensible precautions, and perhaps join in building a better social environment. I'll keep an ear out for you. Particularly on Mastodon, where I feel much more at home.

Navigating The World With Your iPhone:
One day, I got a call from John Morgan. I had known this kind philanthropist for years. It all started when I travelled with him to help a younger blind teen learn how to do more with his computer. Subsequently, he'd call me whenever he wanted my thoughts on accessible technology and whether it would be helpful in various circumstances. I would have gone anywhere with him.
    John called to see what I thought of a device designed to give GPS directions to blind people trying to get around on their own. He actually bought me one to try out. There were others he could give it to if I didn't find it useful. As things turned out, I ended up keeping it. I'll never forget the first time I went out on Canada Day on my own and enjoyed the fireworks show put on at the man-made lake near my building. I had previously gone around the area recording landmarks with the aid of a mobility instructor who figured out what the best points of interest would be to keep me from getting disoriented. It felt wonderful to stand with others, knowing that I would be able to find my building when things wound down without relying on anyone else. Before this, I always went to such occasions knowing that I was on someone else's timetable. If they decided to go home, I had to go with them, regardless of how good a conversation I might be having at the time. Thanks to the accessible GPS device, this was no longer the case. I didn't have to worry about being lost for ages mere meters from my place because I kept missing a landmark with my cane. This kind of thing had happened before to me many times in other situations. Miss one or two tactile clues, have familiar sounds masked by wind or other things, and you might as well be on Mars.
    That particular device cost John about as much as a current budget iPhone would cost me today. It served me very well for over half a decade. I haven't used that gadget in over ten years now. Apps on my iPhone have done a far better job locating and guiding me for pretty much that long. Right from the start when I first got my iPhone, the GPS worked very well and there were good accessible apps which put that GPS device to shame. Instead of waiting three to five minutes for the older device to locate me, my iPhone knew almost instantly where I was. Adding landmarks was much easier on the iPhone. Maps and points of interest could be updated much more easily. Things have only gotten better for iPhone users of GPS apps.
    Independent travel and gaining awareness of what's nearby have been tremendous stumbling blocks for me in life. A lot of that difficulty is due to what caused my blindness. I was born prematurely. Doctors followed what was then a common practice of providing extra oxygen to keep me alive. This oxygen certainly had that beneficial effect. However, it also destroyed my retinas and damaged part of my brain responsible for geospatial awareness. Solving spatial puzzles, comprehending geography and geometry, and keeping routes and mental maps have all proven impossible for me beyond a certain level. Things are now complicated further by moderate hearing loss, requiring me to use hearing aids. They're very helpful when it comes to hearing things happen in my immediate vicinity and participating in conversation. However, they don't give me a reliable sense of distance and direction to sounds. Too much background noise or wind can render me unable to navigate or do much of anything safely. Increasing the volume often only makes things worse, as everything, including background noise, is amplified. Even walking through relatively quiet parkland, I've had many occasions where people have suddenly appeared in front of me when it was too late to move around them. They weren't standing still or walking especially quietly, either. All of this is very unsettling when you've been accustomed to hearing everything effortlessly for most of your life.
    I thought it was vital that I explain these circumstances to you before discussing the navigational options your iOS device makes available, so you can put my thoughts in proper context. I have used an app called BlindSquare quite extensively and have done more limited exploratory testing of other apps I'll discuss here. Just be aware that this is one section of this guide where I'll be relying more on what the app makers say the apps can do and on what I've heard other people's experiences have been like. For a number of my friends, these apps are all they need to feel very confident in exploring their surroundings and going to new places completely on their own. For me, they are more helpful in finding out what's around me than actually getting to places. Using them, I can at least be confident of eventually getting home unassisted if necessary. That in itself is quite a marvellous relief.
    Having access to GPS navigation doesn't solve all the mobility and orientation problems for any blind person. Nor does it replace the need for a cane or guide dog and good mobility skills. These apps don't use your device's built-in camera to gather information and aren't aware of what's happening around you. They won't warn you of oncoming cars, bikes, or other hazards. They receive a GPS signal from satellites orbiting the earth and match what's detected to information stored on your device or retrieved from online sources. The information may not always be fully up-to-date. Businesses close or change locations. Any objects such as benches, garbage cans, etc. that you might put into the information as personal points of interest to keep on track could be moved. GPS signals can be blocked by structures, cloud cover, and other things. Defence department regulations don't allow civilian GPS receivers to be as accurate as technically possible. This is to prevent them from being used to precisely guide weapons. For all these reasons, it's not a good idea to completely rely on it. Use your own senses and common-sense.
    To help offset these difficulties, GPS apps may draw data from more than one source. Your iOS device can also tap into information received via the Internet and cell towers to help figure out where you are. Provided you are connected to Wi-Fi, these apps are even useful to owners of iPads, which don't come with GPS receivers included. These receivers can be bought separately, so it's perfectly possible, if somewhat more awkward, to use these apps with iPads while moving. While stationary, iPad owners can examine maps and virtually explore areas before going there, exactly like they could on iPhones. In fact, some people may find the larger size of an iPad helpful when exploring maps.
    Using these navigational apps takes a toll on your battery. As you move, the app constantly tracks your position indicated by the received satellite signals and checks for things to notify you of against available information. When necessary, it will check for and download online information, presuming this is possible. All of these activities require processing power. You may also incur data charges if you go over what your cellular data plan allows for. To minimize this, one thing you can sometimes do is download any maps, points of interest, etc. to your iOS device while you're connected to Wi-Fi. Over the past two years since the first edition of this guide was published, this has become a more rarely available capability. Most modern GPS apps now retrieve current data as needed from various sources and thereby provide more up-to-date information while reducing storage space taken on your device. Check the settings for the apps you use for possible ways to govern the circumstances under which data is downloaded. Investing in an external power bank is also an excellent idea for people making frequent use of GPS apps. They drain the battery of your device constantly as they monitor your location, process the GPS signal and keep map data as current as it needs to be.
    Another thing to consider investing in is a means of hearing information conveyed by these apps while on the move. Some people hold their iPhones in their hands while travelling. This can be useful, as it allows you to point the top edge of your device in directions of interest and make use of the "look around" or "geobeam" features common to GPS apps designed for blind people. This tells you what lies in the direction your device is pointing to. Most people that I talk to prefer to have their iPhones in their pockets and use small Bluetooth speakers, earbuds, or bone conduction headsets to keep informed while their hands are free for other duties. Some apps offer support for use with Braille displays. I've never attempted this, but would presume these displays would be small and light enough to wear around the neck or over the shoulder for easy access while on the move.
    There are two types of apps we'll be discussing here. The first kind are apps that are made for use by the public and are also made accessible for blind people. There are a great many choices here. We'll look at the two most popular ones. These are the Maps app that comes included in iOS, and Google Maps, its primary competition, available free from the app store. We'll also look at some apps for the public that seek to aid their users with aspects of travel. For instance, there are apps that focus specifically on travel via public transit systems. Other apps such as Uber attempt to facilitate travel by connecting would-be passengers with people willing to take them in their personal cars for a fee. Other apps help with more long-range expeditions, booking flights and planning itineraries.
    There are also several GPS apps designed specifically for blind people. These apps try to offer extra information that is helpful for blind users, as well as facilities to help make orientation easier. We'll discuss a few of the more popular options and how they differ. It takes extra effort and expertise to make apps that are as maximally built for blind people as these specially designed apps are. They typically combine functions of two or more apps into a more seamless single app, provide information tailored to be maximally helpful for blind people, and are designed with efficient accessibility from the ground up. It can be a lot easier to master the use of one of these apps than to juggle two or more apps designed for sighted people to gain similar information that is by nature more minimal.
    One thing you should always keep in mind when using any of these apps is that they are designed around car travel. Points of interest included in the maps and data these apps draw from will be located at parking lot entrances or driveways to places. When an app tells you that you have arrived, you'll still need to find the actual entrance to a place. Nothing stops you from creating a point of interest precisely at the doorway or path you must be at. However, it is up to you to perform this task and create the position markers helpful to you. It's a good habit to get into. Just be ready to still possibly have to search a little if there's GPS interference. Don't ever presume exact precision. Also, keep in mind that when you're told that a destination is a distance away at such and such o'clock, that's as the crow flies. In other words, it's a straight line to your destination that doesn't consider obstacles you'll have to cross or get around.
    You might wonder what kinds of special facilities and capabilities navigation apps designed specifically for blind people might have. Users of BlindSquare who wear earbuds or headsets will notice that the indicator sounds that immediately precede being told about points of interest are directionally positioned. You'll hear the indicator beep in the direction the point is located from your position, as much as this is possible. Another often used example is upcoming intersections. Apps designed for blind people will typically give more detailed information about these before a user reaches an intersection, so he or she has a better idea how to safely cross it. Those are just the tip of the iceberg.
    Rather than going step by step through the features and operation of each app I discuss, I have chosen to concentrate more on what these apps make possible and when they might be advantageous. There is excellent help available for each of these apps already. I see no advantage in reinventing the wheel. You can also find audio and video reviews and demos. I feel more comfortable leaving you in the hands of this expertly written help than trying to explain what I haven't used extensively. Your safety might hinge on being familiar enough with an app's capabilities so that you have the mental space to focus more on your surroundings. Presuming you've read previous sections on using VoiceOver, browsing the web, etc., you'll have the skills needed to master these navigation apps using the help provided.
    Even since the first edition of Personal Power was published roughly two years ago, there has been rapid change in this space. More of these apps are drawing upon the same sources of information. Google and Apple are allowing third-party apps to access their data. Also, the quality of openly available crowdsourced geographical data has reached the point where apps attempting to keep ongoing costs low are turning to it rather than that provided by larger companies. Advertising and business partnerships are becoming more common sources of revenue, allowing apps to be offered freely to consumers. Please review any help or instructions for the GPS apps you make use of, as they may change the capabilities they offer or the interface used to control the apps you prefer.
Going Mainstream:
Using Apps Designed for Sighted Users
    Thin, light, and portable, it's no wonder that iPhones and iPads have been turned into powerful navigation aids by clever app developers. Many apps designed for sighted users have been made accessible to blind people using VoiceOver. This has been done thoughtfully. However, blind people simply aren't the core focus for these apps. Information these apps provide is designed to give maximum aid to drivers and other people with sight who can quickly look at the screen while on the move. They have been set up to be operated as easily as possible by people with sight. In contrast, apps designed especially for blind people are carefully crafted to give extra information and easy control by touch gestures or audio menus rather than tools found at a glance. This can make quite a difference. For many people, the Maps app or Google Maps will be quite sufficient for their needs as blind travellers. One major difference is that mainstream apps don't volunteer as much information. You need to use VoiceOver and seek out what's nearby or find out how far away places might be. Other than directions to destinations, sighted people typically wouldn't appreciate being told about everything they're passing as they move along. You'll must have a good grasp and proficiency with VoiceOver to make effective use of these apps while travelling. You'll need to take your iOS device out frequently if you want to consult a mainstream app for information apart from spoken directions that comprise a route.
    As accessibility awareness and disability laws have taken hold, a lot more attention is being paid by developers of these apps to the needs of blind and visually impaired people. Both the Apple Maps app (included in iOS) and the Google Maps app have done substantial work to increase the usefulness of directions and route instructions, especially for blind users.
    Over the pandemic, these apps have continued to be improved. Typically, this has resulted in more information being made available. Google and Apple invest heavily in mapping areas using specialized gear which captures GPS information as well as visual. Crowdsourcing is also a part of the information mix. Many areas are mapped out in tremendous detail, including terrain and satellite imagery. All of this can be very helpful to sighted travellers. For the most part, it's easy for blind users to obtain any non-visual information made available. No image descriptions of buildings or other locations are available. However, air quality or transit information, traffic conditions, and other extra information should be accessible for blind users.
Apple Maps:
The Maps app is designed by Apple and comes already on your device as part of the iOS operating system. It taps directly into data maintained and collected by Apple. It isn't supported by ad revenue of any kind. It is a service meant to enhance the value of Apple products. For people concerned about privacy, this may be a better fit. You can view maps of areas and get directions to places. Apple is also integrating the Maps app with other apps like Uber and Lift to provide maximum convenience. It also supports Apple Pay and Siri. I recently heard a video that pointed out that the pricing information and ride booking procedures were better in the Apple Maps app than in Google Maps. In an effort to rival Google Maps, Apple is investing many resources into collecting geographical data. This new data is slowly being added to the Maps app as it is ready. This includes indoor maps of popular places like shopping centres and airports. Transit information as well as current climate information including weather and air quality index have recently been incorporated into Apple Maps.
    Apple Maps lives up to its name. An interactive map dominates the screen. Blind people can actually explore this map by dragging their fingers along roads. They can also use the VoiceOver rotor to flick up or down between points of interest, double tapping on an item to open an information card about it. You can choose how much of the screen is taken up by these information cards. You also have current local weather, a Tracking button, and a Settings button.
    The information cards have quite a bit of material on them drawn from various apps, as well as the address. You will also find buttons to get directions or call or visit the website of a place. If an app is associated with a place, there's a button to get that. Apple really plays to that strength of integration. The information cards are where that's most evident.
    Moving your finger around the screen allows you to explore the area around you and even follow streets. You can also find out about any nearby points of interest via the rotor by turning it to the Points of Interest setting. Flick up or down between points of interest and double tap on any that interest you. It is also possible to mark points of interest on the map.
    The Maps app is a springboard for many other apps that can incorporate aspects of maps into travel aids. This might allow an app focused on restaurants to offer the ability to give guided directions to a restaurant or show a map of where it is. It also allows Siri to give guided directions to places of interest when asked. You might never go into the Maps app itself, but will still very likely have made use of it without even being aware.
    To find help using the Maps app, the first place to look is inside the user guide for your iOS device. You can get the user guide from the Books app. I've given instructions on how to do this in the Quick Start section of this guide. The user guide from Apple will always have the most up to date and complete information about the features and capabilities of apps created by Apple that are included with iOS.
Google Maps:
Google is, and has always been, the information king. This is leveraged heavily to provide maximum contextual knowledge about places. Apple initially was going to simply tap into Google's data and pay for using the information on its products. However, the companies had a falling out and are now competing in this particular sphere of interest. The map is almost secondary to the information in Google Maps. When you enter it, you'll find a Menu button, a search field, and several further options including checking traffic, getting directions, and entering compass mode. Below, you'll find a heading called Explore (your local area name). In my case, Explore Mississauga. Flicking right below that heading brings you to buttons that are categories of places. Double tapping on one will show you local places in that category. For instance, double tapping on "coffee" will bring up places where you can enjoy coffee nearby. When you drill down like this, there will always be a Back button to get up to a higher level.
    If you double tap on a location in Google Maps, Google finds and displays everything from the website. This includes buttons for guidance to the location, a button to call a place, and all kinds of reviews provided by users of the app or from other places. You can learn a great deal about restaurants and places of business just from what comes up on a place's information screen. Don't forget to scroll down with a three-finger swipe to the left. There are usually some screens full of information. More than you'd get on Apple Maps.
    Google Maps has many features, including a compass mode as well as the ability to download a local map for offline use. If you use this latter option, be aware that some features depend on having a data connection, and you'll miss out on those if you're completely offline. All of this is explained in the app itself. To find the extensive help available from within the app, double tap on the Menu button at the top left. Next, flick right until you come to Help and Feedback. Double tap on that and then flick right until you get to help and double tap this. You will arrive at a web page with extensive help and instructions.
    If you use other apps in the Google ecosystem, you may find that they can interact with Google Maps when this is advantageous. This certainly includes any Google searches you'd perform with the Google app. This app is supported by businesses and advertising. You may encounter ads while using Google Maps if you thoroughly explore the information provided. Also, keep in mind that Google and Apple have different philosophies when it comes to privacy and sharing data. With Google, the data you generate is a product for businesses and other interested parties who have agreements with Google.
    Google Maps also has facilities to make sharing information such as possible locations easier using social media, messaging, or email. This can make working out what restaurant to meet up with friends at easier. People can look at reviews, visit the website, and access the menus that restaurants make available online. This can be extra helpful for blind people, since it provides a menu that you can examine without someone sighted having to read it to you. This way, when your friends are ready to order, you can be too.
Optimal Perspective:
Using Apps Designed for Blind Travellers
    While it's certainly quite possible to make good use of the Apple and Google Maps options, there are alternatives that have been designed from the start with blind users in mind. They tap into the same sources of data as other mainstream GPS apps. However, they present information in ways to maximize the benefit to a blind traveler. For one thing, they announce nearby points of interest and other information automatically. You don't constantly have to interact with the app to find out what's around or how close you are to an important landmark. What's more, the interfaces of these apps have been thought through carefully to make them as easy as possible to use from the perspective of blind people. This can make an enormous difference.
    There are numerous GPS apps designed specifically for blind users. They are more likely to cost money, unlike the mainstream apps we examined previously. There are several reasons for this disparity. For one thing, there are research and development costs associated with making these apps as easy to use and beneficial as they are. The potential user base for these apps is a lot lower than apps designed for sighted users. This reduces how attractive they are to advertisers and other ways that enable mainstream apps to be free to their users. It would be very distracting, counterproductive, and possibly dangerous to have advertisements intrude on blind people as they try to take in navigation information while listening carefully to their surroundings. There are often fees for developers of these apps to make use of the geographical data they tap into. Rather than having consumers pay an ongoing subscription, many developers choose to charge a higher price for their app up front and absorb the ongoing fees.
    We'll look at the most popular apps in this category. Remember that there are other choices out there.
    I won't be going too deeply into how to operate these apps. In all cases, you can find a very detailed user guide and/or-other help right from within the apps. The guides are also available online at the websites for the apps. With a bit of searching on Google, YouTube, or your favourite podcast app, you'll find all kinds of help including podcasts demonstrating the app, frequently asked questions, a link to contact the developers, and the user guide.
BlindSquare:
www.blindsquare.com
    BlindSquare costs $54 Canadian in the app store. It's a very popular option with a loyal following and frequent updates. Some blindness organizations will make BlindSquare free to their members. Also, there are sometimes sales which reduce the price for this app substantially. BlindSquare is an app that leverages data from the Foursquare database. Foursquare is a social app and game that lets people check into places they visit in the real world, telling people where they are. They can earn badges for visiting places often or visiting many places in areas, being certain to check in using the Swarm or Foursquare apps when they're present. They can also rate and review places. This data is tapped by BlindSquare to find points of interest so that it prioritizes more highly rated and popular locations when they're in your area. It also draws data from the OpenStreetMaps service, which provides information about streets, paths, intersections, etc. Combining these two sources gives a very useful picture of your surroundings, which is constantly updated by people checking into places and uploading GPS coordinates.
    Rather than taking up space on your iOS device with preloaded maps and a geographical database, BlindSquare frequently checks for data as you move. Nothing is stored on your device apart from points of interest that you create. As a result, BlindSquare takes up a small amount, around 100 MB of storage space, on your device. This small footprint makes BlindSquare quite manageable, even on devices with low storage capacities. Especially considering what you're getting in terms of capability. You absolutely need cellular data to make use of this app while travelling and not connected to Wi-Fi. It regularly checks for new points of interest to report to you as you're moving around.
    Using BlindSquare, blind people will be alerted to points of interest that come within a radius in categories of interest that they can specify. It is possible to filter what BlindSquare announces so that there is time to hear more of what's around you and what you're actually interested in. For instance, you could have it only announce restaurants within your search radius. By default, all categories are active, and BlindSquare tries to find the most popular and closest places to tell you about. Being able to focus in on what you want is a key capability.
    Another special capability of BlindSquare is the ability to use 3D sound if you use a headset to sonically indicate the direction of points of interest it tells you about. As you walk along, you might hear a short beep, sounding like it's ahead and to the right. That will be immediately followed by an announcement of a doughnut shop that has been detected. There are many other short audio indicators that can clue you in to where things are, whether you use a headset and perceive the 3D positioning. This has come in very handy for me when navigating the path around the man-made lake near my apartment. I have added in benches, large rocks, and other points of interest that make good landmarks, and hearing the direction they're in as I approach has enabled me to find them more easily after I've become disoriented.
    You can also access and control most capabilities via an audio menu that you access with the Play/Pause button on your headset. This allows you to have your phone safe in a pocket and still control most of the tools BlindSquare offers. To access this menu, simply press the Play/Pause button of your headset or earbuds. A menu of options will then be cycled through and announced one by one. You merely use the Play/Pause button again to indicate your choice. This simple and consistent interface lets you easily adjust the radius, activate sleep mode while you stop and speak with someone, find out what's around you, announce where you are, etc.
    You can also use voice commands to control BlindSquare. This is similar to asking Siri or another digital assistant to do something. There is a list of commands specific to BlindSquare, which you can find out about by asking the app for help. As of version 5, voice commands make use of Apple's built-in speech recognition and are therefore free to use. You no longer need to purchase command credits.
    Another new feature added to BlindSquare in version 5 was the ability to extract location data from a photo, either taken by you or shared with you, and create a point of interest using that information. You can then save that point of interest, simulate it, or do anything possible with other points of interest. Location data needs to be part of the photo file. It doesn't recognize places by their appearance.
    The app has been designed for maximum ease of operation using VoiceOver and was extensively tested by blind people. It can also give information from beacons that may be placed in or outside of venues. The CNIB Community Hub in Toronto has such a beacon.
    BlindSquare also has a Look Around feature, which lets you point the top edge of your phone in a direction and find out what's there. There are options to get weather information about a place, an option called What's Around Me that announces nearby points of interest, a Nearby Intersections option, and many other options. For instance, when visiting a restaurant, you can call the place, get directions via a third-party app, view the menu, and much more. You get at these options by double tapping on the location, whether it's in your favourites or in a list of search results. BlindSquare has also been designed to work with Braille displays. You would presumably wear a small Braille display in a sling bag, having it on your chest or over a shoulder for easy access.
    BlindSquare packs everything onto one screen and into menus accessed from that one screen. At the top is a toolbar featuring buttons to let you access tools, settings, and other features. Beneath that row of buttons at the right edge of the screen is a radius adjustment slider. This lets you quickly increase or decrease the area around you being checked for landmarks or that will be used during searches. Below this are a plethora of category search options, as well as a button giving access to announcement filtering. This lets you fine tune what is announced as you move around. The more familiar you are with the layout of this screen, the better your experience will be while on the move. It is absolutely possible to flick through all the options, but so much quicker if you have a rough idea where they are and can touch a point on the screen that is close or right to the option. At the bottom of the screen are other options, including the Sleep Mode button near the bottom right. This lets you put BlindSquare to sleep during a conversation with someone or while you don't want it checking for information and announcing things.
    You can go into the Tools button and then flick through to reach options such as Look Around. If you're wearing a headset, you would more likely take advantage of the audio menu by using the Play/Pause button on your headset. Options would then be spoken, and you'd just hit the button again when the one you wanted was spoken.
    BlindSquare cannot plan routes and give turn by turn directions on its own. However, it has been designed to interact with other apps operating in the background while using another app like Waze, Google Maps, or the Maps app that comes on your iOS device, etc. These apps can be given coordinates by BlindSquare and can then plan routes and give directions. BlindSquare can also hook up with transit apps like Transit or Moovit and give information such as bus stops and arrival times. Tying into these apps, BlindSquare can provide quite a comprehensive navigation service, making things as easy as possible for blind people. That's because it can run in the background while other apps have focus. You need to give permission for BlindSquare to be able to do this.
    Recently, BlindSquare has partnered with the new Aira service discussed in an earlier section of this guide. Users in supported countries like Canada, the US, and others, can be alerted to nearby locations where Aira is available free of charge. It is also easy to call an Aira agent from within BlindSquare and receive help via your iOS device's camera or smart glasses if you're wearing those.
    Here is an example of travel using BlindSquare. I find that BlindSquare is what I turn to for when I'm walking around my local area. Once I had the app, I got a mobility instructor to walk with me around the path that encircles the man-made lake near the building I live in. Around the path, there are several benches, garbage cans, paths leading in other directions, etc. As we came to suitable landmarks, I stood as near as possible to them and added them to BlindSquare. I didn't set them as destinations, so they don't clutter up my menu of those. However, they are announced automatically as I approach them. I am, therefore, warned of both bridges on the path well before I come to them. These are narrow crossings of small creaks, so I know to slow down and make certain there's room for me to cross safely. There are enough landmarks recorded so that I can quickly tell when I go off the path. My apartment is also marked in BlindSquare, so I can determine how to head towards it and return home.
    When I had friends over, prior to the pandemic, I often took them to a Symposium Café, which was a restaurant in a local mall. Sadly, this restaurant has long since closed. BlindSquare would announce the many landmarks along the route as I walk from my apartment. Once I had gotten there, I could also access the restaurant's menu from inside BlindSquare. While the online menus of restaurants aren't always kept as current as might be wished, it gives a good idea of what kinds of things are available. Once I've arrived at a place and viewed the menu, I can then put BlindSquare to sleep while having my meal and then wake it up when I leave the restaurant, so it can help me navigate home.
Good-maps Explore and Goodmaps Outdoors:
While both the BlindSquare and the Goodmaps Explore apps make use of the same sources of map data, they differ sharply when it comes to the user interface. Goodmaps Explore and Goodmaps Outdoors take a very different approach than BlindSquare.
    The apps use tabs across the bottom. Getting at the functions you want may involve double tapping on the right tab and then finding the function you're after on a screen far less packed than BlindSquare's all in one main screen.
    Each app has a different purpose. Goodmaps Outdoors is a turn-by-turn GPS app optimized for outdoor travel. It offers the ability to record routes and automatically generate waypoints to keep you on track. It's easy to search for and add points of interest. These are stored on your device and may also be shared with other Goodmaps Outdoors users. A look around wand feature lets you scan your surroundings by pointing your iPhone in various directions. Many announcements have sounds which precede them. This allows Bluetooth headphones to wake up before information is spoken and also alerts you to different types of information. Extra verbosity is provided regarding intersections.
    Meanwhile, Goodmaps Explore has more minimal outdoor capabilities. It doesn't do routes outdoors, but instead focusses on navigating indoors. An increasing number of venues are mapped using the Goodmaps process, which doesn't require any beacons or other hardware to be maintained in buildings. Instead, detailed images and measurements combine to provide a 3D map of a venue. Any user of Goodmaps Explore can make use of this information to navigate inside a building.
    The interfaces of the two apps follow similar designs and break functions up into easily mastered tabs and screens. People are able to configure Goodmaps Explore to avoid stairs and make other decisions which effect how routes are created.
Ariadne GPS or Lodestone:
For a couple of cheaper navigation apps designed specifically for blind people, consider Ariadne GPS or Lodestone. Ariadne features a map that is totally accessible with VoiceOver and can be explored by touch. This app has been around for a long time and hasn't been updated recently. Another alternative that is still being updated as of 2020 is Lodestone. It is produced by blind developers and allows local information to be downloaded for offline use. It is much cheaper than the two apps I focused on above, and was originally developed for Android smartphones. One particular advantage it offers is the ability to be far more specific about the categories and geographic regions you choose to store on your device. For devices with lower storage space, this is a very attractive capability, giving the best of both worlds and making certain you're never without local information. Out of all the GPS apps I've examined, this one may be the only one left which allows for extensive data to be loaded onto your device. It also has a steeper learning curve than some of the other apps, but you're rewarded with a wide array of functions and feedback.
Travel Aids:
Other apps to obtain are not made specifically for blind people, but may help with travel. TripIt is an app for managing the details of a trip. You give it information such as flights and hotel bookings, and everything is kept track of in that app. It offers numerous perks to frequent travellers and is said to be accessible for blind users.
Uber and Taxi Apps:
For more local travel, consider obtaining the Uber app. Many taxi companies also have apps. These can help with ordering rides, make payment easier and more secure, and much more. These apps generally work well with VoiceOver and can be very useful.
Final Thoughts on Navigation and Travel Apps:
It's incredible to think of how much choice we have in terms of our approach to getting around. Even the more expensive options are, by a long shot, cheaper than the devices designed for blind people that I've heard of. If you take the time to get confident with using VoiceOver, you can have very thoughtfully designed, accessible apps that do just as much as those more expensive devices. That iPhone in your pocket can be a lifesaver if you get turned around out there. BlindSquare has certainly helped me get back home when I've gotten disoriented walking outdoors. GPS apps aren't perfect, but they open up many possibilities for blind people.
    Do yourself a big favour and learn about any settings and configuration options related to the app you plan to use while travelling. There are typically many ways to customize what gets announced automatically, how far around you the search radius extends, and much more. Those options can make all the difference between something which distracts you needlessly to something which provides exactly what you need when you need it.
    When you're not using GPS apps for a while, it's best to close them, so they don't continue needlessly using data and resources in the background while you don't need them. I've had more than one occasion when I discovered I hadn't done this, and, therefore, had less remaining battery power than I thought. While travelling, please be mindful of how much hearing blockage and distraction you're incurring. Earbuds and over-ear headsets block your natural hearing to a high degree. There are plenty of reports of fully sighted people wearing these and failing to hear oncoming cars and other sometimes lethal hazards. Personally, I use a bone conduction headset while travelling. I have the volume as low as possible while still being able to reliably hear information. I never ever play music while walking. The only thing I want to hear besides my environment and people around me are the navigational announcements from my GPS app of choice. Some people worry that their iOS devices might interrupt the announcements at a critical moment with something unrelated to travel, like a notification that somebody tweeted you. I usually set my iPhone focus mode to do not disturb while I'm travelling, so nothing else intrudes on the announcements and operation of my GPS app. This mode has become very flexible in iOS 15. You can add specific contacts to the list of people able to interrupt you, and do a lot more to customize which apps might do so. Don't forget that while in this focus mode, your iOS device can still receive information. Just check the Notification Centre when you get where you're going and find out anything you missed on the way. Normally, if I need to make or answer a call, I'll move to one side of the path and stand still until the conversation finishes. I take as much responsibility for my own safety and that of others as I possibly can. Safe travels, everyone.

The TV App and Other Streaming Services:
These days, more people are watching what they would once have sat in front of a TV to experience on their computers, tablets, or smartphones. Content streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+ have grown tremendously popular, especially over the past five years. The TV, once an essential part of every home, is now increasingly losing its grip in favour of the flexibility and convenience offered by streaming services. For blind users of iOS devices, this is a very welcome and compelling development. Now, instead of having a TV taking up space, you can pull out your iPhone or iPad and listen to your favourite movies or shows anywhere you wish. You can absolutely have large speakers and displays if you prefer, but you could also simply use Bluetooth headphones or the EarPods that come with your iOS device. Screen size doesn't really matter when you can't look at it. Thanks to VoiceOver, everything is quite accessible. Finding out what's available is easy. Also, most services will offer at least some of their content with described audio, which is easy to turn on or off as desired without sighted assistance.
    Even when described audio isn't available for content, there are still benefits to using streaming service apps if you're blind. For one thing, there's the portability of your device. It doesn't matter how big the screen is if you can't see it anyway. I can pull out my iPhone and AirPods anywhere and fully enjoy shows. I can broadcast content to TVs or speakers that may be present in the area, allowing me to bring the party to other people. Also, there are subtitles. VoiceOver can read those out loud, making it possible to enjoy shows in other languages, hearing the English subtitles. You can also rewind and hear things again that you missed out on the first time. And then, many of these services let you run them in the background while doing other things. This is great for blind people who don't actually watch the screen anyway. You could hear a documentary or educational show and take notes in another app while you listen. You could pause a show and look up words you don't understand right when you hear them.
    Some of my readers might wonder what it means to "stream" content, such as an episode of a show. Basically, streaming is a way of making content available by having it only be present on your device as it's actually needed. It's not saved permanently onto your device. Services like Netflix don't want you to actually keep copies of what you watch using their platform. They don't have the rights to sell you files of movies and shows. Instead, they have a system that keeps constant track of your position in a show or movie as you watch the content. Only a tiny fraction of the show or movie is ever actually present on your device. It's only there long enough to be played. These slices are large enough so that enough new data is downloaded before you finish playing what's there, so there's never any unwanted pause in the action. This makes it possible to have tremendous amounts of content available, which doesn't take up much storage space on your device. This prevents you from keeping and sharing copies of what is offered. You need to be logged into the service to view content. A high-quality movie might be two or three gigabytes, so this isn't just about protecting themselves from theft. A lot of the services, including Netflix, actually do let you download content for offline watching as long as you're a subscriber and use their app. The downloaded material is encrypted so that it will only work within the proper app.
    For the most part, these services operate by people paying a subscription. You pay a subscription and gain access to their library of content. This typically includes content that has been produced by others, such as favourite TV shows and movies. However, subscription revenues also increasingly pay for original content made especially for a particular platform. Netflix, Disney, Apple, and Amazon all invest heavily in shows or movies made especially to be viewed on their particular service, at least initially.
    Not all services operate through subscriptions. There are some exceptions. I would say that YouTube is a streaming service. You can subscribe to YouTube TV and YouTube Music and access content you otherwise couldn't. However, the bulk of their revenue comes from advertising that they expose viewers to. Furthermore, YouTube lets anybody post content and even pays people revenue if it's very popular. In fashion and blindness circles, Molly Burke is a familiar example of a YouTube content provider. TV channels and national media outlets like CBC and BBC are also increasingly offering the ability to stream content, especially to people in the countries they operate in. The CBC has an app for its TV content called CBC Gem and also one for its audio content called CBC Listen. Canadians can watch anything for free with ads or subscribe to remove ads and access some extra things like the CBC News channel. However, the bulk of their revenue comes from Canadian taxpayers as well as from advertising.
    For the most part, the apps for these services are at least basically accessible to VoiceOver users. However, much like websites, some apps will be easier to use than others. For instance, Apple TV is by far the smoothest experience for blind people. It honours the descriptive audio setting in the Accessibility settings. Once that has been set to "on", audio description will be used whenever possible while in the TV app. Unfortunately, other services don't clue into that setting. In most cases, you need to go into subtitles and audio options while a show plays and select a track with audio description. After you've done that once, most services remember and will use described audio whenever possible.
    Another area where content providers may unfortunately drop the ball is when it comes to the accessibility of their apps. Updates come out quite often to improve these apps. These updates might change their visual appearance in an attempt to clarify things or simply incorporate a more aesthetically pleasing design. Updates might add capabilities such as better parental controls, more security, or the ability to display content in a more advanced format. Most frequently, updates are released to fix bugs which users have complained about or app developers have detected. In all of these cases, it is quite possible that people will neglect to test whether such updates break accessibility for people with disabilities. This isn't normally out of any kind of malice. It's more likely the result of the endless pressure to improve the user experience for the average person. Sometimes, changes which Apple makes to accessibility features like VoiceOver catch developers off guard.
    Having content audio described is tremendously important to blind people. There are countless occasions where it can be impossible to tell what's happening by sound only. How much content is audio described will depend on which service you're using. Also, it can sometimes depend on which country you're in. I tried watching "American Gods" on Amazon Prime and found that there was no described audio. However, I've read tweets from people in the UK who did have audio description available. Perhaps, they were watching the series on a different service. Alternatively, there are occasions where the described audio is only available in certain countries due to broadcast rights, which streaming services must honour.
    Another area where things can differ greatly is when it comes to actually browsing or searching what content is available on a streaming service. Some of them like Apple TV and Netflix are easy to explore. Things are organized under headings, and there are buttons to explore different categories. A separate tab lets you search for something you already know the name of. Other apps aren't as polished, and it's obvious that accessibility wasn't part of the thinking process of developers. When I initially wrote this section for the first edition of my guide, I found the Crave and Disney+ apps more difficult when it comes to exploration. You had to flick through everything and couldn't jump around as much. Things have improved overall in this particular area. On the whole, it's usually very possible to find out what's available and explore for yourself. You use the same skills that you would to browse the web. The better you are at this, the easier you'll find using the websites and apps of streaming services.
Getting Started:
There are a few steps to get set up with these services. You'll first want to obtain the app for the service you want to use from the app store. These are free to download, so there's nothing to lose by taking these services for a spin. Creating an account and subscribing to the service will be the first order of business. There is typically a trial period before you will be charged a subscription fee. This lets people look around a service to see if it works well for them and has the kind of content they're after. The only thing is that you need to remember to cancel your subscription before this trial period ends so as not to be charged the regular subscription fee at least once. Pick a time when you actually have some time to invest in experimenting with the app and watching some content. In some cases, you can subscribe through Apple's subscription service. This is easy to do and is done from within the particular app of the streaming service you want to subscribe to. From then onwards, you can manage that subscription through the app store. Double tap on the "my account" button and then on the "subscriptions" button in the menu which pops up. At that point, all of your subscriptions will be presented in lists of active and inactive subscriptions. You should be presented with several subscription choices and edit fields for putting in your name, password, email, etc. It depends on the particular streaming service and how much it values the convenience Apple offers its customers. Apple does an impressive job of making the payment and subscription process easy and fully accessible for people. There's the added bonus of managing all the various subscriptions you have through the app store in that one place.
    Some of these services, including Netflix, don't allow people to subscribe through iTunes. Instead, they insist that people subscribe and manage their subscriptions on their websites. If people subscribe through iTunes, Apple then gets a 30% cut of the subscription revenues. Essentially, these services would be paying their competitors just for managing the subscriptions. Meanwhile, if people subscribe using their websites, the services keep all the revenue for themselves. The apps are then merely tools to tap into content you've already subscribed to elsewhere. Apple doesn't charge for that. We see this with Kindle books, where you need to buy the books on the Amazon website rather than directly from the Kindle app. To manage these subscriptions, update credit card information, etc., people will have to visit the websites of the services they use, keeping track of account credentials and everything else for each service. I recommend that people keep a file or use an app like assistEyes Wallet to store such information. You could have a note in the Notes app that you can set to be secure, so you need a passcode or touch or face ID to open.
    Creating an account is usually simple. I have yet to experience any difficulties doing so on a service's website. The Apple Keychain feature will remember passwords you use on various sites, which can greatly speed things up. Most services will also let you sign up for newsletters to keep you informed of what new content is coming your way on their service.
    Once you've created an account, subscribed, and logged in, you'll be using the app of a particular service. A visit to the website of a streaming service will rarely be needed. Once you're subscribed, the app of the service will handle everything. Exactly what you find will differ slightly. When I open Netflix, the first thing I come to is a question asking who's watching. My wife Sara manages our Netflix subscription and has set up a profile for me. I always have to select my name. There's also a "kids" option that would limit content to family-friendly stuff. I merely have to flick right to reach my name and double tap on it. Other services don't offer this ability for different people to have their own profiles. Amazon Prime Video gained this ability after the first edition was published. However, it does seem to require you to share your main Amazon account credentials with other people you want to have access to this service. Profiles can make a big difference to the user experience because these services recommend things to you that you're likely to want to watch. They learn about you based on what you watch, so my profile and recommendations are quite different on Netflix than my wife Sara's. While our interests intersect, we differ greatly in when and what we choose to hear.
    Once you're past that point, things become pretty similar between apps. You're placed on the home screen of a service, which is quite like a website. These home screens are designed to promote new offerings and also any older offerings that the algorithms of the service you're using predicts you might find interesting. It will have headings, buttons, and show titles. Double tapping on a show title takes you into the show's entry, similar to an app in the app store or an item's entry on an online shop. Once in a show's entry, you can read all the details about it by flicking through the contents, just like on a website. You'll also find a Play or Watch Now button. There will be other buttons to help you navigate shows with multiple episodes and seasons. There will be differences in how easy it is to find your way around, just like there are with websites.
    Be on the lookout for sliders, combo boxes, buttons, etc. Interface elements like these are often used. Also, there are almost guaranteed to be tabs across the bottom. As of early 2022, Netflix has tabs labelled Home, New and Hot, Fast Laughs, Search, and Downloads tabs. The names are pretty self-explanatory. You'll spend most of your time on the Home tab of Netflix, unless you're watching content you've previously downloaded or want to look ahead at what's coming. The Fast Laughs tab has short funny clips you can play for quick moments of mirth. At the top of the Netflix Home tab, you'll find a series of buttons letting you quickly select a kind of content such as TV shows, movies, or the one it defaults to called categories. This changes what is shown in the home tab. The target selector button is for selecting something to broadcast your content to, such as a nearby TV or display.
    Things are similar when using the Amazon Prime Video app. They have four tabs at the bottom. Home, Search, Downloads, and My Stuff. The last tab is where you can access settings and manage your account, among many other things. I like having the Search capability in a separate tab. It declutters the experience when you really know the name of what you're after. This illustrates the kind of differences you'll find between the apps of streaming services. Take your time to look around and get to know the style of the service you want to use. That kind of exploration pays off.
    When you're playing content, things get very similar at that point. The video will play and hide the playback controls. They clutter up the view for sighted people. Imagine how distracting it would be if VoiceOver announced second by second how far you were in what you were hearing. That's how it would be for them. Their emersion would be broken by having the playback controls always present on the screen in a similar way. If you need to use the controls, just double tap with one finger to reveal them again. Then, flick left and right to get to the option you want and double tap it. The controls will hide themselves again after ten or fifteen seconds of inaction, so don't doddle. If you simply want to pause or resume playback, you can do so most efficiently with a two-finger double tap. When the controls are revealed, you'll find something similar to what's in the Music or Podcasts app. Rewind, fast-forward, pause, or resume playback, and move using a position slider through the content. Also, you'll find an "audio and subtitles" option or something similar. Sometimes, it's called "language and captions". Double tap this, and you'll be where you can select subtitles or audio description. Again, flick left and right through the options and explore them thoroughly. You should be able to find the audio description option if the title you're playing has it available. Once you set this on for one title, you shouldn't have to do it again, since it'll remember that you prefer audio description and use it when available.
An Abundance of Choice:
For the most part, these services try to be different from each other through various means. They have slight differences in the look of their apps. They compete for your subscription dollars through price to a point, but there's no race to the bottom. If anything, prices are increasing as the amount of available content increases. You'll find the most striking differences when you consider the content they offer and create.
    Netflix is the oldest kid on the block. They were certainly the first streaming service I heard about, as they predate this form of content distribution. They used to allow people to rent DVDs of movies for a flat monthly rate. Having and holding this dominant position, Netflix tries to offer some of everything. People will find all sorts of old and recent shows, movies of all kinds, documentaries, and comedy specials. I've found their original content to be the most extensive and varied. From the popular show "Stranger Things" about kids in the 80s living in a strange town, to original documentaries like "Our Planet", there's something special for pretty much everyone that you won't be able to find elsewhere. Netflix also invests a great deal of money into creating original new content for its subscribers to see before anybody else does.
    Since Netflix has maintained its grip on the "everything to everyone" spot, other services have needed to find other angles of difference. Not being very drawn to many series, I'm perhaps not the best guide to these services with their hours upon hours of content. I've always been more partial to a good book. I've only dipped my tows into these services so far. The possible exception to this occasional dipping may be Netflix, which I've enjoyed for a longer time and dug more broadly into.
    The pandemic gave a whole lot of people a whole lot of time they couldn't spend out and about. This has accelerated the growth and enhanced the competition between the various streaming services. All of them have kept a steady stream of fresh content coming during the past years of lockdowns and increased economic stress. As prices have increased, people have picked their services of choice. Otherwise, they drop one service to subscribe to another with a particular original series or other contents they want to consume. Their loyalties shift when yet another service features content they're more interested in at the time.
    As far as I can tell, Amazon Prime Video is going for a more bookish literary vibe. A great deal of their content seems to be somehow book related. You'll find original series like "The Expanse" and "Jack Ryan". These are both based on book series. This dovetails nicely with their Kindle and print book sales, which was a large part of how Amazon got started in the first place. It feels right that they would go in this direction.
    Meanwhile, Disney+ is all about making the truly massive Disney archive of movies and shows available, as well as other properties they are acquiring. The most notable of these acquisitions as of early 2020 are the Star Wars and Marvel Comics franchises. I think of them as being the superhero inspirational brand. Disney has always been about dreams and inspiring family-friendly content. With their acquisition of the Star Wars franchise plus Marvel and other comic-related content, it seems clear that they're doubling down on this image with their Disney+ service.
    Last but not least, Apple comes very late to this particular party. They have recently begun to make inroads, especially with Apple Music, which is discussed in its own section elsewhere in this guide. Their streaming service for shows and movies is called Apple TV+, which ties directly into their TV app. This app also offers the ability to hook into third-party services like Disney+, Amazon Prime, and others. The TV app will bring all the content from the various services you make use of under its own roof. It can act as the central point for your viewing and will launch the proper third-party apps when you want to watch their content.
    The Apple TV+ service offers Apple's own original content as well as a selection of channels with their own separate subscription fees if desired.
    Apple is really focused on originality and quality. It has a kind of highbrow feel to it. There's not as much content offered on Apple TV+. However, what's there is unique and consistently quite well done. It has become a favourite for me. The collection of original content is growing quite rapidly. It's like Apple is saying, "We may not have as much as the other services, but we offer better stuff."
    Many blind users have gravitated to the Apple TV Plus service. Their content is always offered with described audio. They also make use of Dolby Atmos sound. People will find all kinds of original movies produced by well-known creators and starring celebrities at the top of their game. Apple also offers a lot of shows geared towards children and families. There are also a growing number of documentaries.
The TV App:
The TV app that comes with iOS will let you subscribe to and watch Apple's own content. This includes what's on the Apple TV+ service, as well as some other channels with separate subscription fees. It also lets you connect accounts from other streaming services, provided that they permit this. Once that happens, the TV app can display the listings for shows offered by those third-party services. For instance, if you connect Amazon Prime Video, any shows you watch in that app will be displayed as entries in the TV app itself. However, if you actually go and play such content, the app created by the third-party content provider will open and be given focus. You will then view the show or movie you chose in that app rather than in the TV app. Apple, therefore, takes no responsibility for your viewing experience of third-party content, as it's contained completely within the separate apps.
    There are five tabs across the bottom of the TV app that let you access different areas. From left to right, these are "Watch Now", "Originals", "Store", "Library", and "Search".
    On the far left is Watch Now. This is where you can browse what's available through Apple's own service, plus whatever third-party services you've linked the TV app to. There are many headings in the tab which can help you navigate more easily. These contain things such as popular content, what you've recently watched, or other content which Apple thinks you might be especially interested in.
    The "Originals" tab contains Apple's own growing collection of content. Again, there are plenty of headings to help you navigate. If you find something in this tab and are subscribed to the TV Plus service, that content will be available for your enjoyment.
    The middle tab is called "Store" and lives up to its name. People used to need to go into the iTunes app in order to purchase movies and shows. However, Apple has seen fit to offer a replacement for this in the form of a single tab store in the TV app. Anything you purchase in this tab will be added to your library and available for downloading to your device.
    The Library tab comes next in the bottom near right. It contains any content such as movies and shows that you have purchased or downloaded. You can add and remove content from your device. You can also play content.
    Over on the far right is the Search tab. This lets you look for things that you know the names of. It displays the results of your searches in an organized fashion. It also provides a list of popular searches made by others. Let's look at each of these tabs in greater detail.
The Watch Now Tab:
This tab is the most dynamic and busy tab in the TV app. Similar to the Book Store tab in the Books app, it has a number of headings and buttons to help you navigate, constantly updating content. Near the top of the tab, you will find a heading called Watch Now, which makes it easy to get back up to the top of the large scrolling area. Flicking to the right, you'll next find the Account Settings button. This is where you can set preferences as well as manage connected third-party services. Beyond that button, there are buttons for filtering contents. The Movies, TV Shows, Sports, and Kids buttons will limit the contents of the Watch Now tab to items fitting those designations. Once you use one of these buttons, you can always find a Back button in the top-left corner that will return you to the main Watch Now view.
    Past these filter buttons, you'll come to the first of many headings that divide up the many screens worth of available content. The Up Next heading indicates that the section immediately below it will feature shows you're currently viewing or have recently watched. You might find the next episode in a season or a movie you might be in the middle of. Flick left or right to go through the contents, and double tap on what interests you. It may begin playing automatically once you've done that. If you encounter a show or movie that interests you wen doing your explorations of other parts of the app, never fear. There will be a button in its entry allowing you to add the item to what's in the Up Next section. Discovering that Apple TV+ was adding a reboot of Steven Spielberg's "Amazing Stories" during my explorations, I immediately took advantage of this feature and keenly look forward to this revival of a special show that I have fond memories of.
    There are many headings below, including What To Watch, which features recent additions or shows which might interest you. There's also a What You Can Do heading where you can learn more about what's possible from within the TV app. You'll also find a Learn About Apple TV+ heading. Beneath it are links and buttons along with explanations of what subscribing to Apple TV+ will provide you access to.
    Keep in mind that even without such a subscription, you can still make use of the TV app. You can, for example, rent and buy movies directly from within the app and view them. The entry for an item you're interested in will indicate whether subtitles or described audio are available. There are other channels offered by Apple that you can directly subscribe to. As this content comes from third parties, there will be a subscription fee for these channels separate from an Apple TV+ subscription.
Store:
This tab is full of headings such as "Hit Rentals", and "New Movies". The contents are constantly changing. Take your time and listen for image descriptions. The contents are often displayed as movie posters. This isn't the easiest tab to deal with, but it's workable if you are patient and careful.
    A lot of shows and movies are offered with described audio. The accessibility information in the item's entry page will inform you of whether description is available. Be careful when purchasing bundles of movies. I've had occasions where only a few movies within a bundle had described audio and chose to request a refund for those bundles. Apple isn't obligated to give you a refund for such purchases. However, my experience in this area has so far been positive.
Library:
The Library tab is where you'll find any shows or movies that you've rented, downloaded, or purchased. You are able to do things like deleting downloaded items to free up space. Also, it's a handy spot for keeping track of rented content that you will want to watch before the rental period expires. There is a Recently Purchased heading for things like TV shows or movies that you have bought through the app or the iTunes store. These items will be shown under that heading, even if they aren't downloaded onto your device. This lets you stream them without taking up storage space. Upon examining the Library tab, I found a documentary about science fiction that I had forgotten I had actually purchased in 2018 when it was released.
    Other than the heading for recent purchases, you'll also find buttons for downloaded content as well as for different types of content such as TV shows and movies.
Search:
If you know even a partial name of a movie, a performer, director, etc., this tab will likely prove a more rapid means of finding the show or movie you're interested in acquiring than the store tab. Simply type in one or more words into the edit field and then double tap the Search button at the bottom right. You'll be shown a list of any results. If you don't type anything in the field, flicking past it will reveal a list of popular recent searches. You'll never be stuck without something there to double tap on. Keep in mind that any search you conduct here will only look at content available through Apple's TV+ service and the iTunes store. Third-party app offerings won't be searched, and you'll need to go into their individual apps to explore what they have to offer. Any app of this kind will have a similar search capability. This will either be in the main tab at the top, where you'll find a button or edit field. Alternatively, they may have a separate tab for your searches, much like the TV app presents you with.
The Netflix Experience:
Over the past year, I have spent more time than I ever would have dreamed using the Netflix app. Other than the TV app discussed above, it seemed logical to also examine the Netflix app and service, so my readers would have a means of comparison when examining it and other streaming service options. Doing full explorations of every available service doesn't strike me as necessary, given how similar they are in terms of how they function. However, looking closely at two will hopefully prove helpful.
    My wife Sara signed up for Netflix and found the app to be pretty accessible. She seemed to enjoy what she was hearing on the service. It didn't cost much more to add what they call a second screen, which allows us to each have a profile and watch things at the same time. I had been hearing more about how they've added audio description to their content. It seemed like a good time to give it a spin.
    Subscribing to Netflix was easy. Sara chose to subscribe through the Netflix website rather than the app. She had no problems subscribing or creating a profile for me. She just had to tell me the username and password. I used those to log in with the Netflix apps on my iPhone and iPad. In terms of difference between devices, I found no particular advantage for blind people in using an iPad versus an iPhone. Some of the more expensive iPads apparently have fairly good built-in speakers, which are better than what you'd find in an iPod or iPhone. They would also be more widely spaced apart, given an iPad's larger size. However, it's even more effective and less costly to employ one or two Bluetooth speakers for much better sound on whatever device you might use. The larger screen of an iPad might be useful for people with low vision.
    As with other streaming service apps, you'll be using the same skills you would to browse the web. Knowing how to use the VoiceOver rotor helps a lot. Set the rotor to Headings, and you'll be able to get to different areas much faster. Also, to do anything other than browse and consume content, you'll need to be able to browse the web with Safari, since those things are done on the Netflix site outside of Apple's purview.
    When you open the Netflix app, if there's more than one profile, it asks who's watching. Just double tap on your profile. On my iPhone, I don't always get asked. It just seems to know sometimes. Once that's done, you'll find yourself on the Netflix home screen. This has a very simple setup. It's similar to the Kindle app in that there's a Browse menu button at the very top followed by a search field. After that, you'll find a featured show followed by a very brief description of it. After that, you get into a large number of sections separated by headings. Use the rotor to flick up or down to the one you want, and then flick left and right to brows. I've found that you sometimes find more items in a section if you go to the next heading and then flick left through the titles. Double tap on what interests you to leave the home screen and go into that entry. You never get stuck anywhere in the app. Just look near the top left for a Back to Browse or Close button to get out of an area.
The Netflix Home Screen:
There are numerous headings with all sorts of recommendations. The top one is Top Picks for (your name), which tracks in on what you show interest in. It's a key reason we wanted separate profiles so that we'd get recommendations tailored specifically to each of us. There are also Trending Now, Popular on Netflix, and a Continue Watching heading that features things you haven't completed viewing. As the service learns more about what you like, you'll find more headings further down the home screen.
    You can scroll up or down with three-finger swipes. You'll be given page numbers to help you orient. Moving up or down gives you fewer pages, but you can also swipe with three fingers left or right across the screen. I think this moves you more slowly through the content, so there are more pages to go through. If I scroll vertically, I currently get around eight pages of content. Going across, I get around thirty-five.
The Browsing Filter Buttons:
Near the top of the home screen, you'll find a button called Account Settings. This lets you manage aspects of your Netflix profile and account. Flicking to the right, you'll find buttons for TV Shows, Movies, and My List. Double tapping these buttons will take you into those specific areas of content. You'll find many different categories. These let you look at a range of content that isn't tailored specifically for you, like a lot of what appears on the home screen. Other than a list of categories, you'll also find different show titles. Double tap on any that interests you to access that show's entry, just as you would for a book or app entry in a store.
    If you have your preference set to Described Audio in the Accessibility settings on your device, you'll always get audio description when it's available for items on Netflix.
Setting Preferences and Parental Controls:
Double tap on the Account Settings option in the area at the top of the home screen. There, you can set parental restrictions and manage other areas of settings not found in the app. Netflix is like Amazon in that way. The app is all about consuming the content rather than account management and managing your subscription with Netflix.
Examining Entries and Playing Content:
Once you've double tapped on an entry of interest, you are then taken into that entry, which will now have focus, filling the screen. There, you'll find details about it as well as a Play button near the top of the screen just after the Close button. The Close button takes you back to the home screen or the search screen you were in. Hitting the Play button will play the movie or the show episodes. It will keep going until you use a two-finger double tap to pause, or until it checks to see if you're still present and watching. It does this after a while, and you can just double tap the Resume button to keep going. There are Rewind and other control buttons available, including a slider letting you move quickly through an episode. The controls are kept pretty simple during playback. After you finish an episode or movie, waiting long enough will let another one start.
Subscribing to Extra Channels:
As people choose to abandon cable TV in favour of these streaming services, many channels are becoming available for streaming. Examples of these channels are the City TV Plus package offered through Amazon Prime Video as an extra subscription. For an additional monthly fee, you can add one or more channels to what's available. These will include live-streaming content such as news or sports broadcasts. They will also typically include an archive of content which can be watched on demand.
    How easy it is to subscribe to these channels depend on the streaming service offering access to them. As usual, users of Apple TV have the easiest time. You can subscribe to channels directly from inside the TV app. Like all other subscriptions, they're handled through Apple's subscription services. So is the payment management. Most channels will have trial periods, so if you take advantage of one, be certain to cancel the free trial before it expires, or you'll be charged the price of a month's subscription.
    To subscribe to a channel on Prime Video and other streaming services, you'll need to go to the website and handle things from there. If this is the case, remember that the subscriptions to these channels must be managed from that site rather than through Apple's system. Once you've subscribed, it should be possible to view the content from within the app. If not, you can do this via the website. Once you double tap on an item and then on the "Play" button, the video should open. Remember that not all content will have described audio.
Further Thoughts on Streaming Services:
This section really hasn't needed any major updating since the first edition of the guide. Prices have gone up despite the economic uncertainty all of us are living with. More services are beginning to experiment with subscription plans which include advertising in exchange for being more affordable. Apps have slowly improved over the years. Other than these trends, very little has changed.
    Overall, I think these streaming services are very advantageous for blind people. In addition to the rapid spread of audio described content, there is also the advantage of being able to easily explore what's on offer. Given the tremendous abundance of content available, that's a good thing. One further advantage is the ability to pause what you're watching and look something up on a search engine like Google. If you find that an aspect, character, or words used in a show leave you confused, chances are that you'll be able to find a helpful explanation on the web. This might be a review of a show, a site set up, especially for helping newcomers to a show or movie understand what's happening, or simply a review that happens to explain an aspect of what you're hearing. You can also often find plot summaries and other content that may explain parts that don't contain enough audio information to follow fully. VoiceOver can read subtitles. This has allowed me to enjoy content produced in languages other than English. Hearing VoiceOver read subtitles does tend to break that fourth wall and wreck one's emersion in the story. However, it's better than not being able to follow a show at all. If you happen to use Braille, the subtitles can be sent silently to your Braille display rather than spoken.
    I've enjoyed a lot of what I've heard over the past months of having these services available. It has helped me feel more connected to the wider cultural landscape. I've been better equipped to participate more fully in conversations with sighted family and friends. I hope that the quick tour of the streaming services offered here will give you enough information to start taking advantage of the services that most fit your budget and appeal to your interests. There's more content on offer than one could consume in a lifetime.

Avoiding Scams And Other Online Crimes:
For many people around the world, the pandemic forced people to retreat from social life and stay largely at home unless venturing out became absolutely necessary. One had to shop, study, participate in social gatherings and find ways to stave off cabin fever by participating in the online world. For many of us with disabilities, myself included, we found that we could actually participate on more equal terms since events formerly held in person were now conducted via the Internet. Many advances were made in the apps and services which allowed such participation on a massive scale. Suddenly, a lot more attention was paid to making things easier and more accessible for everyone. I've heard it said that the Internet saw more advances in the space of a year than would normally happen in five. All of us needed the shops, websites, and apps needed to stay connected and supplied to just work. Seemingly overnight, my life felt a lot less unusual.
    Unfortunately, criminals have historically been quick to spot opportunities to take advantage of people moving into unfamiliar territory. They started upping their game and did their best to take advantage of the millions of people who would never formerly have shopped or did much of anything online, but who were now forced to be there. 
    After the second edition of this book was published, I became increasingly aware of the rising number of scams and other online crimes which ordinary people were falling victim to. One need not be particularly gullible or lack intelligence to become a victim. Given the right circumstances, anyone might be duped into paying money or divulging information to bad actors. These online crimes may not pose immediate physical danger, but their effects can absolutely ruin people's lives.
    Scammers and criminals look for our weaknesses. We all have those. Perhaps, we're too rushed and distracted to stop and think about what we're doing and saying. Perhaps, the criminal has gathered enough information about us to be extra convincing. On the other hand, perhaps we may lack critical information which may have prevented an attempted scam from working on us. Many things can interfere with our best judgement. Often, it can take paying careful attention to details and inconsistencies to avoid falling for an attempted fraud.
    Having spent over three decades socializing, shopping and taking full advantage of the tools and strengths of online life as they evolved, I've been exposed to my fair share of spam, scams and social trickery. However, thoughtfulness and luck have so far been with me. I've never been robbed of money, or been through the horror of having important identity information stolen. I've developed an almost visceral sense for this sort of thing. However, my track record isn't perfect. There have been a few instances where I've given people more information than I should have before realizing that an attempt was being made to obtain sensitive information from me.
    Over the years, I've read books and articles, listened to news reports and podcasts, and tried to keep up with the dark side of the online life I have come to appreciate so deeply. There's always more to learn about in this area. I've never for a moment presumed that I was somehow safe or above being a victim of someone's bad intentions. However, I've gained enough wisdom to hopefully help others keep safe as they participate in this increasingly important sphere of life. In this section, I will attempt to pass on the wisdom I've gathered regarding online crime and how to conduct yourself safely.
Phone Scams:
As an iPhone user, you are vulnerable to all the same phone scams which have plagued civilization for decades. Additionally, you are vulnerable to all the scams perpetrated by text messages. These are a somewhat more modern criminal undertaking. In such scams, you might be told that you owe taxes and will be arrested unless you press a button on your phone and provide information to someone pretending to be a tax official. Alternatively, you might be offered a service which seems legitimate such as duct cleaning. There are an endless variety of these scams, since criminals are constantly trying to take advantage of current events and circumstances.
    While there are times when scammers are targeting you specifically since they've learned something about you, they mainly cast their nets at a wide group of people. In one popular scam, you receive a phone call. You hear a synthetic voice which informs you that the call is from the tax department. It goes on to say that the police are on their way to your door to arrest you unless you press a button and pay what you owe. Typically, the voice doesn't use the correct name of the tax collection agency of your local government. For most long-time residents of a given country, that's an immediate sign that it's a false call. Another is the robotic voice itself. I've often been amused to hear a familiar voice which I've used on my computer or phone being unwittingly put to nefarious use.
    In another scam, we may actually be waiting for a package when we get a call from what appears to be the very shop or service we expect a package from. The voice on the call will say that more information is required or action is necessary before the package can b delivered. This scam is also inflicted on victims as a message which contains a link to click on to take action. The scammers hope that you'll act without thinking first. The information they hope you'll provide can be used for identity theft among other things. It can be sold to other online criminals who can then attempt to scam you or scam corporations pretending to be you.
    There is no shortcut that companies will legitimately offer people who owe money or await a delivery. Always take the time to verify the information they give you. Another thing to keep in mind here is that companies who you deal with will already have information which they'll ask about to verify your identity. I recently got a call from Rogers by one of their ambassadors. He was offering me a chance to update my modem and save on my internet bill. Rather than ask for my information, he told me what information they had and simply asked me if it was correct. This way, I knew I was dealing with a legitimate company representative. I didn't have to provide any information that Rogers already knew about me. I agreed to the offer and the new modem was installed the next day.
    A new danger is now emerging for phone users thanks to artificial intelligence. It is possible to take a sampling of a person's voice. Perhaps, they posted a video online with them talking about something of interest to them. Perhaps, part of a presentation they gave can be used. The computer can analyze that speech, break it down into phonemes, which are parts of speech such as vowel sounds, consonants, etc. From these building blocks, a digital voice can be constructed which sounds similar to the original speaker. This has been happening for years now. However, artificial intelligence greatly increases the quality of these voices.
    There are numerous things which scammers can do with these cloned voices. They will use them to fool people at legitimate companies into revealing information or doing something on behalf of whom they believe they're dealing with. Another alarming trick they can try is to use the synthetic voice to persuade friends or family of that person to pay money that the speaker needs to get out of some difficulty. This may be a ransom to release them from supposed abduction. Short sentences of the voice might be used to plead for help or money. The idea is to create enough urgency so that people don't pause to think about whether the choice of words sounded like those the person might say, imperfections in the imitation, etc. This can be especially effective against the elderly or people whose friends or family members are especially likely to get into such difficulties. People have lost thousands of dollars to this kind of crime.
    The only real defence against such calls is to be thoughtful. Don't let people rush you into foolish action. Know what's happening to the people in your family and circle of friends. Also, observe how they tend to speak. Chances are that the criminal who tries to fake them won't have enough information to do it convincingly. Certainly not for longer more involved conversations. Something will eventually ring unequivocally false.
    Please remember that numbers can be spoofed. The number that the call appears to be coming from is unlikely to be the actual source of the call. I thought to hang up and call the number of such a scam back. The person who answered had a completely different voice and knew nothing about the call which was made to me. Thankfully, phone companies, as well as software in your iPhone, are both getting beter at identifying such spoofed scam calls. I've been warned by my iPhone, when I've thought to pay attention to who it said the call was from, that this was likely a scam call. If I let such calls go to voice mail and the scammers have actually let a message, I've found warnings that would indicate that it was likely spam.
Emails of Evil:
There are many scams which make use of emails. Many are similar to text message scams. Ultimately, bad actors want you to click on a link, open an attachment without thinking, or answer and provide information that you ought not to divulge.
    With text messages, the aim is to catch people in a rush and have them click on the link before pausing to think. Emails are typically much longer than text messages. They may also employ formatting, signature text, or other things unique to the companies, individuals, and organizations which make use of emails. Scammers can create very convincing emails and then embed links which look genuine but lead to sites or to malware which might infect your computer or phone.
    In this age of online shopping, you will frequently be ordering things from various online shops. One popular scam is to receive a message which thanks you for a recent order. This is usually for a more expensive item. Many people will click on the link in the message thinking to cancel or stop the order which they never made in the first place. To cancel the order, you are taken to a site which looks legitimate at first glance. It might have places to put your email and password for your account at that store. Alternatively, it may try to get you to click on a link, which might then get you to click a button which runs malicious software on your computer.
Sophisticated Attacks:
As more people have begun using smartphones, more efforts are made by criminals and intelligence organizations to target these operating systems and bypass their security. The scams I've encountered so far have largely used social engineering to attempt to get me to divulge what I ought not to. However, I'm increasingly hearing about attempts to target iPhone users with attacks which don't require action on the part of the users.
    Apple goes to great lengths to make such attacks difficult. Apps and sites must typically ask your permission to access potentially sensitive resources including contacts, microphone, camera, etc. Expertise to thwart such protection doesn't come easily or inexpensively. Most such attacks are aied at particular individuals who are in positions of influence or power. The average user shouldn't be overly concerned as long as they think before clincking on a link in a message or email they receive. You're still far more likely to be tricked into willingly divulging information than you are to have it stolen surreptitiously.

Living Well with an iPhone:
By the time the third edition of this book is being read, I will have been using an iPhone for around fifteen years out of the half century of my life so far. I can't think of anything which has had a greater impact on how I do things and what is possible for me to accomplish without sighted assistance. It has also connected me with more people and provided me with access to far more information than I've ever dared to imagine would be possible.
    Some people have asked me how to live well with these devices and avoid the pitfalls and temptations they present. The reader should be aware that I'm far from a perfect role model in this area. I've had plenty of moments where I've been more attentive to my palm-sized piece of tech than to my surroundings or the people with me at the time. However, in this section, I will outline the dangers and share what wisdom I've gained from the mistakes I've made, my own more positive experience, and the astute thoughts of some considerate researchers whose books I've read on this topic.
    These devices are tremendously powerful. So much so that I've long thought it would be a good idea if new owners had to go through a kind of orientation course. This would familiarize them with the capabilities of their devices and take them to a good level of competent control. Owning a smartphone does have some pitfalls. These would also be covered, preferably before people began using their smartphones. The course would include time for conversation between participants and span perhaps around twenty hours. In this age of information, misinformation and disinformation, owning a smartphone is the equivalent of being able to buy a car and drive it immediately without first obtaining a driver's license.
    This may strike you as a bit of an extreme comparison, but consider: You're dealing with a powerful computer with all manner of sensors and capabilities, which is small enough to be in a pocket. This connects you to a staggering amount of unregulated information in addition to commercially available digital goods and services. You can access this digital world anywhere you might be. It's positively ludicrous to have that much power at your fingertips and be unaware of the majority of what it can do for you. We would be horrified if drivers of cars didn't have to understand how to work the brakes before getting their licenses. If homeowners refused to learn how to use their cooking appliances safely or lock their doors and windows, we might well question the wisdom of their owning a home. Especially if it's in our own neighbourhood. We should be just as concerned that people may be utterly unfamiliar with the security measures at their disposal or don't understand anything about the digital spaces in which they might operate using a smartphone. For the purposes of online life, your smartphone is the equivalent of a home and car combined into one hand-held device. It's your responsibility, much as it is with a car or house, to take appropriate steps and use these things responsibly.
    When you get right down to it, these are tools. They may seem intelligent, but they aren't really aware what we choose to do with them. My cane is also a tool. I can use my cane to walk competently and feel what's ahead of me. However, I could also misuse it to break someone's ankle, trip them, smash property, and do all manner of terrible things with it. It's quite possible for someone else to steal my cane and use it to commit what would necessarily be a brutal murder. From a very young age, I was taught that carrying a cane was a privilege rather than my right. People impressed on me how important it was that I didn't misuse my cane to intentionally injure others or damage things. While I was actually taught not to apologize for lightly contacting people with my cane and thus learning where they were, I was encouraged to consider others as I moved through the world with it.
    Our smartphones can also be misused and can allow us to accidentally or intentionally cause harm to others. From spreading information to bullying someone via social media apps, there are plenty of ways to cause mischief relatively inconspicuously to those around us. We can and should learn to view our smartphones with the same weight of moral responsibility that I was taught when I began to carry a white cane.
    I've often heard the complaint that we're "always on our smartphones". In my experience, those who make this complaint are typically unaware of the many very worth-while uses these devices can be put to. I used to feel a little defensive and personally misjudged by such people. On one hand, they never seemed to offer any worth-while compelling alternatives to being on my iPhone doing what I was doing. Rather than shop independently using my iPhone to access a grocery delivery service, I'd need to inconvenience possibly multiple people and pay more to get to and from a store. And then, there's knowing what's in the store beyond what a theoretically helpful soul thinks I need to know about. What difference does it make to anybody else if I'm reading a physical Braille book or reading one of thousands on my iPhone using a portable Braille display connected via Bluetooth? What's so bad about being able to navigate as I walk along thanks to directions and landmarks called out by my iPhone as I go past?
    A major problem for people is that to an outside observer, it all looks the same. It's next to impossible to see enough of what someone is actually doing with their smartphone. You can't just look at a crowd in a subway station and figure out that one person is using his iPhone to read a news article while another is listening to music or texting someone. That texter could just be casually passing time with a distant friend. He or she could also be helping a child with homework, giving vital instructions to a house guest wanting to use an unfamiliar appliance, or frantically trying to convince someone not to do something destructive. Sometimes, we've just had a hard day and genuinely need a safe distraction.
    Unless a Braille display is used, operating an iPhone is very much an auditory experience for blind people. This should always be kept in mind. People who are close enough will hear and understand what your iPhone says. This is particularly likely in otherwise quiet settings like classrooms and libraries. More broadly applicable, however, is that everyone can hear what you dictate to your phone. I've heard many people's sides of loudly conducted arguments, the occasional relationship break-up, and thoughts which should have been privately noted down rather than publicly broadcast to the phones of their owners and everyone else in earshot. People are under some sort of illusion that nobody around them will care. One-sided conversations can, in fact, be very compelling. I've occasionally had thoughts of following people or stopping what I was doing just to hear how such an argument or conversation turned out for the person within earshot. If you're not mindful, you can plunge people around you into your far from private story, and they'll feel compelled to listen.
    Remember that general knowledge of accessibility tools and the hundreds of apps useful for blind people in these smartphones is quite poor. The whole premise of a blind person making use of a touchscreen device isn't a very intuitive leap. Particularly for people who don't understand how blind people approach things. I still often encounter people who are amazed that I can use and iPhone or wonder if I'm faking my blindness. This can test one's patience, but I've tried to approach these situations calmly and politely whenever possible.
    Another problem this widespread lack of knowledge presents is that people don't realize that it's a far bigger ask for us to "put our phones away". They have no idea how much independence and accessibility they're asking us to forfeit. A good part of living well with a smartphone is to make your peace with that. Don't feel badly for using your smartphone when it's actually being of genuine use and benefit to you. A weekend where you've left your smartphone behind is a very different experience for blind people who are truly using them to the fullest in their lives.
    That being said, it's all too possible for blind people to be just as harmfully absorbed in their smartphones as sighted people are. We may rely more on our smartphones to access things which sighted people wouldn't have to, such as books, newspapers, print, etc. However, we also do the same kinds of things everyone else does. We are just as capable of doom-scrolling on social media, listening to podcasts or music to escape our dull surroundings, catch up on endlessYoutube videos, etc. While we're not alone, we need to be certain we're mentally present in the moment with people who may want to potentially interact with us. Short of wearing a sign saying "I'm happy to stop what I'm doing and chat!" I have yet to find a really practical way of enjoying the benefits of your smartphone while making this clear to people. Unlike people who can still see that they're being approached or that others are around and open to chatting, blind people can't read body language and might well be drowning out the sound of real life happening nearby.
    This is by no means a problem exclusively for blind people to solve. Fully sighted people seem quite capable of ignoring their surroundings at inopportune times, being absorbed in their smartphones. There is also a reluctance to break into each other's thoughts when smartphones or earbuds are in evidence. A book by Sherry Turkle called Reclaiming Conversation discusses the many hidden costs to society which have resulted from so many people being connected by smartphones to their personal circles of apps and people. At gatherings where smartphones are in evidence, conversation among attendees tends to be kept light and inconsequential. This allows people to be inattentive with relative social impunity, drifting in and out of conversation as they choose. People find it easier to text those who are absent than to talk to people in their immediate presence. One never knows when any number of people might be paying attention to their smartphones rather than each other. Turkle found in her research that people increasingly find it easier to conduct uncomfortable or important conversations via text at a distance, since they can edit what they say before sending their messages. According to Professor Turkle, and a good many others, the art of conversation is suffering under the technological on slot we find ourselves in. The book covers how this always connected lifestyle impacts different spheres of life, including everything from friendship, education, romance, work, and more.
    Don't ever feel like it's on your shoulders alone to solve this kind of societal hangup. We've reached a point with smartphones where people are beginning to appreciate what the cost we're paying in damaged in person relationships, lost moments of casual connection, and our sense of local community actually is. It's up to all of us to figure out where our social norms go from there. Smartphones and tablets are here to stay. They often tempt us with too much convenience for our own good. However, in my humble opinion, they are also capable of doing far too much genuine good in our lives to be thrown away or done without. A third, more nuanced thoughtful approach needs to be found.
    In a way, smartphones have given society at large a taste of the same kind of awkwardness I've felt all my life in public spaces where people are having conversations. Being unable to read body language, I'm never certain how welcome I would be if I chipped in, how long anybody involved is staying, etc. We're going to need some new societal expectations and social norms to win back a more natural, reliable sphere of public discourse.
    Until those come into widespread use, I think it's up to us to walk that balance between making the most of our devices and not unwittingly cutting ourselves off from offline life. A lot of that comes down to picking our moments and using the tools for managing interruptions wisely.
    Another balance which we need to be thoughtful about involves what information we choose to trust. This is critical when it comes to information we obtain from social media. Journalists have guardrails and procedures to check facts and make certain that what they publish is true. An organization may have a political bias or slant, deciding to cover things in a way which suits their audience. However, if they publish utterly false information, their reputations will suffer, as has happened. There are no such barriers on social media. Anyone can post anything. Think about the motives of the sources of your information before jumping to conclusions. Especially before coming to unfavourable conclusions about people. A tremendous amount of damage has been done because people didn't bother to check conclusions which fit their world view or that simply felt right at the time.
    Artificial intelligence is another area where caution is warranted. It can be used for criminal activity and spreading false information on social media or through emails. Also, the artificial intelligence we use to interpret what our cameras detect are prone to error. Always think about what apps and services tell you about objects in your environment. If something's really important, try to verify the information with another app which uses a different artificial intelligence, or use a sighted volunteer.
    Earlier in this guide, you'll find two whole sections devoted to focus and notifications. Those are absolutely essential tools for managing when, why and how your iPhone can interrupt you with information. Do the unglamorous work of going through notifications settings. These settings form the bedrock of when your iPhone informs you of things in normal circumstances. Make decisions for each app as to if, how and when it can interrupt you. For each app, ask yourself whether you really need to know the information it will notify you of right away. I have a lot of apps set to deliver notifications quietly to the notifications centre or put notifications into the next scheduled summary. Be certain you're only interrupted by apps where it makes sense that you are. I want to know about changing weather conditions, so the Weather app can interrupt me immediately if rain or severe weather is approaching. Perhaps, your friends and family can contact you on the FaceTime and Messages apps. You may want to let those apps interrupt you with notifications about incoming calls or messages most of the time. On the other hand, you might not want notifications to interrupt you from social media apps like X or Mona. I have these delivered quietly to my notification centre most of the time. Use the Focus settings and create options to change what can interrupt you in special circumstances. I have different focusses for when I'm sleeping versus when I'm on vacation or working on something and don't want anything to interrupt me.
     If I'm with friends, my iPhone will absolutely be with me. However, it's very unlikely that it will interrupt me with any information. I typically have it in the do not disturb focus. If I'm on a longer trip away, I have a vacation focus which does things like make certain my calendar won't notify me of events that I would miss anyway due to being otherwise occupied. There are some people who can call or message me while these focuses are active, but not very many. Some apps can also get through and notify me if necessary. For instance, the Parcel app might inform me that a package hasn't been delivered successfully. However, most things can wait or aren't that important in the first place. All other notifications are delivered quietly and await my leisure in the notifications centre.
    Barring unusual circumstances, during my time with friends or family, in-person discussion always takes immediate precedence. I might use my iPhone to dictate a brief note or obtain information about what my friends and I are discussing if there's some doubt as to our knowledge. For instance, I might ask Siri how old an actor is or perhaps play or read important news which my companions would be interested in. I might use an app to obtain a menu at a restaurant we're eating at, rather than have someone else need to read it to me. However, unless I'm in a group of people who are passing time on their iPhones while awaiting some event, I'll be careful to stay alert for conversation opportunities. I won't do anything too significant or absorbing on my iPhone. I'll save that for when I'm alone or when others are otherwise engaged. There are certainly such moments during longer gatherings or visits. For instance, if I'm at a gathering when everyone is watching a sporting event. When a game is in progress, the conversation about anything else tends to utterly tank in my experience. In-depth discussion is pretty much off the table due to attention being focussed on the game. Things revive again slightly during commercial breaks or timeouts built into many sports. The same applies when others choose to watch a TV show or movie which holds no interest for me. I might then decide to pull out my iPhone and do other things while keeping alert for conversational moments.
    Your smartphone makes an excellent device to capture and document memorable moments with. Many people no longer cary separate cameras or recorders, since what's in their smartphone is mor than sufficient for most circumstances. However, this is another case where just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should. The effort to make certain that your photo, video, or audio recording is as good as possible often means that you're not really experiencing whatever the event happens to be. This essentially turns an important experience in life into a kind of trophy to be collected. Such trophies are, in my experience, never worth the mental distraction from the event in question. Unless you can actually minimize what you need to do to start an audio or video recording and keep the mic or camera focused, you'll get too tangled in tech to be mindfully present in the moment itself.
    For years, I used an app to record moments and share them with a community of fellow users. I had quite a collection of these moments. However, I only rarely actually went through them and listened to what I had recorded. Eventually, the app turned its attentions from being a kind of community archive to more of a podcast making app. All of those recordings were lost. There were certainly other apps I could have used to continue recording life's special moments. However, this taught me that I would much rather fully experience a special moment than remove myself partially from that to preserve proceedings.
    Another thing I try to be conscious of is whether my iPhone is doing other people any good. Sometimes, I'm able to use my iPhone to help someone in some way. On a larger scale, I can participate in tech help lists and forums, sharing what I've learned. I can engage in projects like writing this book in a far more portable fashion than I could have with a laptop computer. While I'm with others, I can demonstrate how an app works, find an answer to a question they have, etc. I always take those opportunities. It not only helps them but also increases my sense of the value of what I'm carrying. People should be just as impressed with the iPhone I use to accomplish something needful in the moment as they would be if I pulled out a multitool to cut open a package, pry something loose, carve a piece of wood or tighten a screw.
    To achieve this kind of effect, don't wait until problems arise to find out such things as how to get help or properly navigate various apps. There are many ways to develop and design the iPhone apps we use every day. However, there are a lot of commonly used conventions, controls, and elements of design. Once you've taken the time to grasp these conventions of design, you'll be much more productive and much less frustrated when you encounter difficulties.
    One day, I was helping an older gentleman who had owned an iPhone for quite some time. He was very frustrated. A community bus route which he relied on to know when a bus would be at various stores and other locations had disappeared from the Transit app. I asked him whether he had investigated how to contact the app developers to get assistance. He said that he always found it a futile and frustrating hunt for that kind of thing. This surprised me, since I had very early on figured out where one should ordinarily look to find them.
    I don't tend to travel on buses and had never used the Transit app in earnest. However, it took me less than ten seconds to find the "user options" button at the top left of the screen. He had never thought to try this or look at the bottom where tabs containing such options are often easily found in other apps. This simple design convention of having important functions at the very top or very bottom, leaving the centre of the screen for information, had never become obvious to him. He simply learned the bare minimum he had to know for each app he needed. Every trouble spot would lead to fruitless frustrating bouts of searching, all because he had never been told about such a basic convention of app design.
    Unfortunately, many iPhone owners don't tend to become familiar with even basic approaches which app developers take to make various settings, contact and help available from inside the app itself. To avoid a great deal of possible frustration when you least need it, it can really help to look for such conventions and patterns. Put in the time to explore apps while you're comfortable before you require them in any sort of rushed circumstances. You'll feel far more graceful and in charge that way.
    Smartphones are designed to be used differently, for different purposes, by people with different abilities leading very different lives. All kinds of great advice is put out by well-meaning experts, myself included, about how best to use your smartphone. Before acting on such advice, or thinking that others should, take the time to think about how you typically use your phone and whether the advice makes sense in your or someone else's particular context. For me, the touch typing mode is best. However, others might actually save more time using standard typing. Many people make far more use of the haptic vibrations rather than sound cues. Different doesn't necessarily equate to inferior.
    You wouldn't go out of your way to dull the blade of your knife, put a soft pad on the head of your hammer to soften its strikes, etc, if you didn't have good reason to do such things. Don't lessen the readiness or convenience of using your smartphone unless you have a good reason. Let's go over a few examples I've encountered.
    Preserving battery charge by turning off functions of your smartphone is a prime example. Bluetooth and background app refreshing are commonly sited as things which can be done without in order to save energy. That's absolutely true. However, consider whether that energy is enough to actually be worth saving given your context in exchange for what you give up. Power banks with sufficient energy to fully recharge an iPhone twice can easily be carried in a pocket and won't cost you a fortune. Investing in one of those makes sense in any case, so you're ready if there's a power outage, or you're unexpectedly put in circumstances where you can't access a wall plug. Turning off Bluetooth means that you're unable to use any accessories such as AirPods, your Apple Watch, a Braille display or keyboard in conjunction with your iPhone without first turning Bluetooth back on. Barring unusual circumstances, I would never turn off Bluetooth. It doesn't save anywhere near enough power to be worth doing given how I live my life. Typically, I'm within easy reach of power. I constantly make use of many accessories which require Bluetooth. Perhaps, during a blackout which may last days, I'd consider turning off Bluetooth to maximally ration power given that situation.
    Background app refreshing lets apps check for new information while they're in the background. This is how your smartphone can know where you've moved while you're checking messages as you travel. This is how your weather app checks for storms or other conditions to warn you about. And yes. Your social media app uses background app refreshing to check for new postings to notify you of when you least need such distraction. Background app refreshing doesn't have to be an all or nothing choice. You can choose to turn it off for specific apps but leave it on for others. It takes a bit more work, but it's well worth doing. You'll have a much more satisfying experience than if you simply turn background app refreshing off for everything. If I had an extremely limited data plan, perhaps it would then be worth doing. However, I don't typically come anywhere near using even ten of the thirty gb of space my monthly plan includes. I turn off background app refreshing for some apps which I don't typically use, but leave it on for nearly everything without missing the small amount of data possibly wasted.
    Security is another area where people can really go overboard. Before you enable lockdown mode, restrict the use of apps with a long and all too forgettable passcode, or come up with a massively long password for your Apple account, stop and think. Seriously, think about the inconvenience you're creating for yourself. Is there good reason to incur this? Are you really in that much danger from others around you that it's better to be locked out of your iPhone than take the risk that someone somehow finds out what they need to cause havoc? The person who you've chosen to be your recovery contact might not be near his or her phone when you've forgotten your passcode or password. You may have to go through Apple's verification procedures when you're in a hurry and need your iPhone now. There are circumstances where more extreme security measures are absolutely justified. You might be entrusted with information so dangerous that extra security precautions are warranted. Perhaps, you're actually being threatened or stalked by someone. In that instance, you should certainly consider more stringent measures, despite their increased inconvenience to you. However, absent such extreme threats, the default precautions, such as a six digit passcode, enabling Face or Touch ID, a password with ten or more characters, etc, is more than sufficient. It's enough to use Apple Pay, be trusted by banking apps, and the like. Before you add in more security, really think about whether it's necessary given your circumstances.
    The above tips will help prevent your smartphone from being made needlessly less useful. One way that they are unlike other tools is that smartphones present us with the constant temptation to fill every idle moment with something of personal interest to us. Gratifying these temptations is never more than a few taps and swipes away. Our favourite music, podcasts, books, or postings on social media from our online circle of people are right there for the taking. Just because we can avail ourselves of this doesn't mean that we always ought to. Others will see the iPhone in our hand or the earbuds in our ears and likely presume we're otherwise occupied. Always being occupied isn't good for encouraging spontaneous social interaction with those around you. It also doesn't allow for more free-flowing thoughts to emerge. Take some time each day and choose not to do this. Spend those five minutes waiting in line or in the doctor's waiting room not using your smartphone.
    Even more vital than leaving room for social interaction with those around you, there's the matter of your own inner thinking. Give yourself time to simply sit and think. Be present to your own inner life of thought. Sometimes, the very thing which helps us find solutions or newfound purpose is a simple pause of action to give our minds time to wander. Boredom isn't always the enemy. If you find total silence unnerving, I've often found meditation apps or ones which give access to soundscapes to be useful. Music or sound without any words can give us a helpful point of focus. Typically though, there's plenty of sound around us already. Sometimes, I take time and simply listen to what noise can be heard in my apartment. Especially in warmer weather when windows are open. Give your mind some breathing room.
    You need not be online for your iPhone to be useful or able to entertain yourself or others. The calculator is always available. Your calendar can be accessed offline, as can your notes. I keep all of my thousands of Kindle books on my iPhone. I have a selection of music. There are audiobooks, games, and movies. Navigation information can be downloaded and used later if your Internet connection is lost. Apps like VD Scan offer the ability to read printed documents while offline. I use a certain amount of space to keep a constantly refreshing collection of podcast episodes. Enough to provide over two days worth of listening. Using an app called Kewix, I have a reasonably up-to-date copy of Wikipedia and Wictionary on my iPhone. This gives me access to an incredible amount of information even when unconnected to the web. Not everyone has the storage to spare that I do on my iPhone, and you need not go to the extremes that I have. However, be aware of what's possible even when you're offline. There's no way I'd ever be able to read all of what I have ready at hand. However, take time to get a grasp of the resources you gather on your iPhone. You never know when a cookbook of simple recipes, dictionary, or first-aid and survival instructions might be useful.
    Take the time to learn about what you have. Thinking of these devices as mere phones does them and yourself a grave disservice. They are incredibly complex advanced tools which can literally do thousands of different things for us. They are the equivalent of an astronomer's telescope or a blacksmith's forge and tools. In this world of valuable information, an iPhone can gather, sort and shape information for our pleasure and advantage. An iPhone is a house and car for our digital world. People put their lives at risk to gather the resources needed to make your iPhone. Many people work long torturous hours to assemble these tools. And that doesn't even take into account all the effort needed to make them as easy to use as they are. Even when bought used, these items aren't inexpensive. The least we can do as owners is take good care of them and invest the time to learn what's possible and how to use them in ways which enrich our lives. Taking this humble attitude and the steps I've outlined above, we can hope to live well with our iPhones and the people around us.

Economics of iOS Device Ownership:
Even on a low or fixed income, owning an iOS device makes economic sense if you take the time to master it and put it to as many uses as possible in your life. Thinking of it as a powerful, multipurpose tool and key to experiences is the best mindset to approach owning an iOS device with. It's not just a phone, and it isn't a toy or accessory. The more time and effort you invest in discovering and mastering its capabilities, the happier you'll be with your investment. You'll also be better equipped to maximize the economic benefit an iOS device can bring. I thoroughly understand how much of a sacrifice it can be to own and maintain an iPHONE. They're typically pricier than other smartphones. This is all the more true if you opt for the most current generation. Added to this is the ongoing cost of a phone and cellular data service plan. For people on fixed and lower incomes, this can be a substantial sacrifice of disposable income. In this section, we'll take a look at the costs involved and set these against the savings and economic benefits which owning an iPHONE confers on you. Most of this can apply to iPads as well. The only real difference is that you need not pay for a cellular data plan or sign a contract with a carrier. I'll also give what advice and wisdom I can about how to minimize and spread out the costs while maximizing enjoyment.
    To properly evaluate my advice here, I think it's important that you have some understanding of my financial status. I'm not about to divulge specifics. However, I do consider myself to be privileged in many ways. How am I privileged? Although I'm on a fixed income and live in a subsidized apartment, I am able to earn a modest amount of extra money for contract work that I do. I also have a very supportive family willing to offer some financial aid when required. Between these factors plus some gifts and honorariums from time to time, I fully realize that I can live more comfortably than many of my peers. There are certainly limits. I don't do any travelling beyond my local area. My situation does somewhat confine what I can do economically. This is especially the case when it comes to earning, receiving and saving money. There are rules around all of these things which I must obey or face pretty drastic consequences. For instance, if I break rules and no longer qualified for my rent subsidy, the money I had to pay to keep living in this apartment would suddenly increase to around five times as much as I currently pay. I don't take these rules lightly. However, it is a safe and relatively stable existence as long as you accept the limitations and obey the rules. My basic needs are covered. I am able to save a little but basically live month to month without the sheer desperation and stress this can entail without being certain of having ongoing income. Provided that I'm careful with my spending, I can live in what I think of as reasonable comfort. The contract work I do dovetails with my natural interests and has allowed me to invest in apps, subscribe to services, and do more than I otherwise could with my iOS device. Another major factor is that I have no costly vices apart from my love of buying books and tech accessories. That should give you as much of a sense of my economic circumstances as you need to consider my thoughts here in your own possibly very different context.
    If my own financial outlook became notably tighter, there are several things I would do to reduce my iPHONE-related costs. I would be more hesitant to purchase or subscribe to apps. My Kindle library wouldn't be added to as frequently as it has been. I would more seriously consider making due with less preferred apps which didn't have ongoing subscriptions. The iOS ecosystem doesn't lock you into ongoing cost beyond a certain point, so you can put dwindling money towards what you most value. There are certainly services which I would be loathed to do without. However, things would have to be very tight indeed before I would need to dump those services.
The Costs:
Obtaining your device is likely to be your first cost. This will vary depending on which device you choose. IPADs are typically paid for up front. It is absolutely possible to pay for an iPad in instalments, but I have yet to encounter anyone who has done that rather than save up and pay it all at once. The only additional ongoing expense is for one's Internet service and any equipment needed to provide Wi-Fi connectivity. Some people choose not to invest in home Internet and take their iPads to places where they can access Wi-Fi at low or no cost when they need internet connectivity. There are libraries, restaurants, and other places which offer this to visitors. That is about as inexpensive as online life gets.
    For iPhones, things are a bit more complicated. There's the cost of the iPHONE itself. This can either be paid all at once or, as is frequently done by people on lower incomes, paid over a couple of years as part of a contract. Such a contract typically locks you into a cellular data and phone plan with whichever carrier you select. In my own case, I paid around $115 Canadian per month for the cellular data plan plus what I owed for the iPHONE 13 while I paid off its cost over two years. Having unlimited Internet service available in my apartment is an additional expense. I forgo paying for television. I try to stretch the time between iPhone upgrades as much as possible, barring disaster or extremely useful new capabilities. In pretty much all of these areas, there are possible choices of iPHONE, carrier, service plan, etc, which would reduce these expenses to a degree. Your options will differ from country to country, depending on government regulation and other factors. You could well come to far different decisions than I have. For instance, if you're fortunate enough to be able to purchase your iPHONE outright, you're not stuck with a certain carrier until your contract has been paid, your ongoing costs between iPHONE purchases can be substantially lower. Your carrier may be willing to make a special deal in order to retain you as a customer, since you'd be free to switch carriers at any time. Those are the major fixed costs. Beyond this point, we enter the realm of personal choices and preferences.
    There are all sorts of optional extra costs which you might find worth incurring. What sorts of extras might you want? First of all, there are the services Apple offers. I use most of these, so I choose to subscribe to the premium Apple1 plan. This entitles me to make as much use of Apple Music, 2 terabytes of cloud storage, Apple TV Plus, Apple Fitness Plus, and Apple News Plus. I'm able to share all of these services with my wife Sara and a small number of others who I might add to the family plan. The cost of this plan has risen from the $37 it cost when I published the second edition. For this bundle of services, I pay around $45 Canadian per month as of May 2025. On top of this, I also maintain subscriptions to Audible Canada and Amazon Prime. Added together, those total around $40 Canadian each month. I consider this superb value for under $100 per month. There's a lot of room for people to choose services which suit their wishes. None are at all essential. However, I've found that subscribing to some services like the above greatly increases the utility of my iPHONE.
    There are more optional occasional costs. Apps in the app store will cost money. Some of these will require an ongoing subscription, while others will be a one-time payment. A surprising number will be free. Many apps, such as the Kindle app, let you enjoy digital goods from other markets. There are a wide range of choices when it comes to online shopping and digital goods like books, movies, audio dramas, some podcasts requiring subscription, etc. Indeed, your iPHONE does tend to make online shopping almost dangerously easy. I would advise budgeting for at least an occasional impulse purchase. The movie you've always wanted to own, the meal you can order with some swipes and double taps, that audio drama which sounds so epic. You get the idea.
Savings:
There are countless ways that having an iPhone can save you money as a totally blind person. A whole lot of different useful technologies are stuffed inside an iPhone. For one thing, they're actually quite powerful little pocket computers. There's as much computing power in a modern iPhone as you'd find in a high-end game console or desktop computer. Some of this is used to provide onboard artificial intelligence. The digital cameras in the front and back of iPhones are good enough that most people no longer bother owning a separate digital camera. The GPS receiver, compass, and motion sensors make an iPhone well suited to help with navigating. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity lets an iPhone help you communicate with others and use a wide array of accessories.
    How does this save you money? Having all of this in something I can hold in one hand or put in a pocket has many profound implications. Because I have an iPHONE, there are a whole lot of expensive things I really don't need to buy. Because of the camera and artificial intelligence in an iPHONE, I'll never need an OCR scanner or costly software to read my print mail and other paper documents. I don't need a costly, accessible GPS device to help me get around. My iPHONE already has a GPS receiver and inexpensive apps take care of the rest. 
    I paid for all the hardware found in most specialty devices designed for helping blind people when I got the iPhone. This means that instead of creating specialized devices for blind people only, developers can create apps which take advantage of what I've already purchased, thereby lowering the costs at both ends. It's also not as much of a stretch for developers of mainstream apps built for sighted people to make them support VoiceOver and other accessibility features Apple has created. I therefore can choose where to put my money towards apps more custom designed for blind people, and when to simply use an app made for everyone.
    An iPHONE can also save you money by making sighted help available when it's most needed. Sometimes, you simply need to borrow someone's working eyes for a few minutes in order to get something done. Combining the camera in my iPhone with secure internet connectivity, apps like Aira and Be My Eyes let me receive such help from people who can look through my camera and find the handkerchief that landed silently on the floor of my apartment. They can help me access an unfamiliar vending machine or other appliance which isn't otherwise accessible. During this past Summer, I used an Aira agent to assist me to adjust the temperature my air conditioner was set to. I can't count the times when items which I might never have found on my own have been found thanks to the connectivity and camera in my iPHONE. You save all sorts of money in avoiding costly mistakes and items presumed lost.
    By making online shopping easy and accessible, you avoid the mistakes made while shopping on someone else's schedule. You can save any transit costs for shopping trips. More importantly, you can take your time hunting for bargains, checking what you already have, etc. That saves money.
    There are a great many things that an iPHONE can become, which negates the need to purchase more bulky, separate devices. You are more free to pick your battles, spending your money where it will make the most difference. Buy one or two Bluetooth speakers and let your iPHONE be your entertainment centre. With an inexpensive keyboard, your iPHONE becomes a perfectly serviceable computer you can take anywhere. With the right apps and accessories, there's tremendous possibility for saving money otherwise spent on other things. Regarding accessories, keep in mind that just because you obtain a new iPHONE doesn't mean that the keyboard, headset, power bank, etc which you purchased will suddenly no longer be useful. Other than cases, you'll rarely be forced to upgrade many accessories just because you got a new iPHONE. Those speakers you bought at a discount might still work fantastically five years later. This lets you pick your moments to upgrade most accessories, such as when what you want is on sale.
Participation in The Mass Market:
Your iPHONE essentially allows you to access all kinds of things at the very same price as anybody else. The entertainment, services, and information an iPhone allows you to tap into are enough to boggle the mind. I haven't bought a music album in years now. Instead, I subscribe to the Apple Music service and can access more music than I could listen to over a lifetime. Subscribing to Netflix, Amazon Prime and Apple TV Plus gives me more quality entertainment than the Cable TV plan I used to pay twice as much for. As finances have gotten tighter and my entertainment preferences have changed, I've long since dropped Netflix. However, if a sighted friend tells me about something he or she watched on Netflix, YouTube, or Apple TV, I can use the very same apps and services on my iPhone to share in the joy. These streaming services now quite often include descriptive audio, which I can enjoy privately on my own device at no extra cost to me. The same holds true for news, magazines, and articles. The Apple News Plus subscription lets me read over two hundred magazines plus all the news articles I could wish for in a fully accessible manner. Because VoiceOver and efforts by app developers make the apps accessible, I am able to use what everyone else does despite being blind. This applies to books, services, and other things which I would otherwise be barred from using without sighted help.
Advice on Minimizing Expenses:
There are many things you can do to make your money go further while getting the most enjoyment possible out of your iPHONE. I'll go over as many of these bits of wisdom below as I can think of. I hope that at least some of these ideas help you reach a bit farther, explore a little more, and be happier with your investment in an iOS device.
    Learn about similar apps before purchasing one. Very often, there are many similar apps which accomplish the same thing but approach what they do differently. For instance, there are many note-taking and word-processing apps. Typically, there are a number of free apps or apps which let you try before investing money in unlocking their full functionality. See if you're happy with any lower cost or free options first, unless there's a compelling reason why a higher priced alternative attracts you. I've become very attached to the Ulysses app, which I'm actually using to write these words. However, had I found Scrivener or other alternative apps earlier in my search, I may never have resorted to Ulysses. You don't need to have every app under the sun. Find the ones which best suit you. I recommend finding at least one alternative app for any really critical functions or tasks in case your preferred choice develops accessibility problems over time. Unfortunately, accessibility is all too often not considered or tested for when updates to apps are made.
    Go over your subscriptions regularly. Increasingly, you will be subscribing to services or apps which meet your needs and interests particularly well. It's a good idea to go into the app store, into "My Account", and "Subscriptions" regularly. Go through all the active subscriptions and make certain you wish to continue paying for them. Cancel any that you no longer want. On the other hand, if there are subscriptions you know you want to stick with over the long term, consider strategically switching them to annual subscriptions rather than monthly. In most cases, this will save you money. You should time these switchovers so that you spread out the payments for individual things, so they come due when you're most comfortably able to pay them. That process will take time as you decide when or if you want to keep paying subscriptions on a monthly or yearly basis. These savings can really add up over the longer term.
    Take full advantage of storage. This is especially relevant to people with limited or intermittent Internet access. For instance, people in more northern and remote parts of my own province of Ontario are serviced very poorly by internet and cellular data providers. The costs for data can be very high and bandwidth can be very low-speed or unreliable. Meanwhile, most of the time, I'm well-connected and reasonably confident in speedy reliable internet access via Wi-Fi or cellular data. Blackouts and extended internet outages are certainly possible in my city, but they are very infrequent. People who live in areas where connectivity is costly or unreliable should first spend the extra money to get an iPhone with more onboard storage space. This will let them minimize the amount of bandwidth they will need. They might also be able to travel to spots where internet access is less costly and more reliable, and then move what they might need into their iPHONE's onboard storage. I can't put absolutely everything digital that I own into my onboard storage. However, I keep what I most want to always have available on my iPHONE. This includes my writing, my Kindle library, some music, audio dramas and books, references like the text of Wikipedia, and Wiktionary, and much more. This way, my iPHONE will still be of great use to me in a prolonged outage if it ever occurs. Keep things like ebooks, music, reference information, and other personal files stored on your iPHONE so that they're available to you without chewing up cellular or Wi-Fi data.
    For others in more connected areas, you may decide not to invest in onboard storage and instead invest in more iCloud storage. This could save quite a bit of money spent on your iPhones or iPads. Lowering the cost of your device would make upgrading to newer devices, more frequently, more affordable. Overall, though, extra storage is less costly to invest in than getting the top model of device. To me, the peace of mind and convenience of having more storage outweighs the savings. Others who live where cellular data and Wi-Fi are reliable and inexpensive will revel in the cloud with minimal onboard storage.

Why I wrote This Guide:
This project has been the most central and time-consuming project for a decade of my life with only short breaks between work on editions. It has grown to well over three hundred thousand words in length. Revising, editing, and updating obsolete sections takes hundreds of attentive hours. Some readers might well wonder what compelled me to expend so much effort and then give away its result freely. Those who don't care should feel free to skip on to the next section. For my more patient and curious readers, you will find my answers below:
    Let's start with why I'm making this guide freely available. One of the major inspirations of my continued efforts on this book is the cherished memories of a very kind man. John Morgan was someone Who I met when I was a young adult. I had yet to find any kind of purpose in life. He was looking for someone to come along with him to help a blind child learn to use a computer. Having nothing better to do, I agreed to go. It was a decision which continues to have a massive impact on my life. We built up a friendship during many visits to this blind youngster as we did our best to be of help. John began calling me more often to ask my opinions on various technology which he would procure for disadvantaged blind people in the greater Toronto area. Over the years, he also helped me financially from time to time. He never asked anything in return and always showed a genuine ongoing interest in the lives of the people he helped.
    During every encounter, I would find out a little about his life.
    He had worked as an engineer since arriving in Canada from Australia. I never learned how this engineer's life initially intersected with blind people. However, by the time I first met him, he had done a lot of volunteer work for the Canadian National Institute for the Blind. My mother originally met John there as she had also done extensive work for the CNIB. After retiring, John expanded his efforts on behalf of blind people. He believed that it was the duty of people who had found advantage and success in life to help the less fortunate. A key way in which he did this, beyond financial aid, was to value our interests, talents, and skills. He always made me feel like I had a friend rather than a benefactor. He never made me feel like a lesser person.
    I started the first edition of this book, intending to present him with an emailed copy upon its completion and telling him how much he had inspired me. Sadly, he passed away before the first edition of this book was finished. He had suffered a fall and never recovered from the damage it did to him. He wanted to have a house party and invite people who he had helped so that they could meet each other. Sadly, some of us met for the first time at his very well attended funeral. All I could do was to thank him posthumously in these pages and honour his memory with my continued efforts to have a positive impact.
    There have certainly been occasions when I've considered making each edition of the book the last one. However, the need for it continues. A moment's reflection on John's efforts and our many conversations about how helping others adds richness to our own lives has always proved a powerful cure to battered and worn down motivation. This is my way of continuing his legacy. This is how I can reach out and help those who are less fortunate than I find myself to be.
    Mainly, I think we're in a situation where the people who require this guide the most literally might not know enough to perceive its value to them. This isn't at all a case of willful ignorance or laziness on their part. Rather, the basic premise, that a device with a touchscreen can be one of the most valuable accessibility tools available, puts up a massive cognitive barrier for blind people. People with sight or people who have experienced this technology don't always appreciate how absurd it can seem to the uninitiated. For blind people who haven't tried an iOS device, it seems crazy to pay to learn what might be possible using something with almost no tactile elements to orient oneself.
    Asking blind people to believe that a device with a touchscreen could profoundly impact life demands quite a leap of faith from them.
    If you had never seen what things looked like from the top of a high mountain, how much effort would you put into climbing one with only the word of a stranger that the effort would be rewarding? Would you pay extra for instructions that no sighted people who use these devices need to pay to become competent? I think many blind people who might benefit tremendously from using an iOS device and accessible apps have approached things with that very naturally skeptical outlook and decided not to acquire smartphones and tablets. Even worse, they went ahead and got these devices, thinking that they would be just as intuitive for blind people to master as they were for people who could see. They then grow increasingly bitter because the information they lack prevents their experience from even approaching what was advertised.
    By sharing this guide with no financial strings attached, I hope to change the equation fundamentally. This guide may be shared freely and given to whoever might benefit. I'm not paid by Apple to do this. Nor am I being financially compensated by blindness organizations, who I sincerely hope will help spread this guide to their clients and benefit from it. There are a great many more enjoyable ways, and potentially a few more profitable ways, in which I could have spent the considerable time and effort that I've put into creating this guide. What has kept me going is my deep sense of how much joy and fulfillment my iPhone has allowed me to experience. I strongly believe that if more blind people can share in this enjoyment, their gains will enrich their lives greatly. Further, this will in turn increase my own enjoyment as well as that of people who already do even more with their devices than I've ever imagined was possible.
    Many people don't share the blessings of family and friends who keep me as informed as I tend to be and give me a measure of safety trying out new things. If these people are going to pay money for apps that might well drastically change their lives, they will first need to be convinced that it is possible; that a flat screen is somehow the gateway to great potential for enrichment of life that is nearly inconceivable before it is experienced. They will need information about the view at the top of that mountain so they know what they are striving for. Furthermore, they'll need the start of the climb to be as gentle as possible.
    I hope that by making this guide a free resource, more minds will be opened to the magnificent possibilities that I have been blessed to benefit from over these past years.
    I've certainly found these efforts to be rewarding in many ways. Not least of which being the many exchanges I've had with my surprisingly loyal and widespread readership. I've received emails from people in many different countries. I've been asked to be a guest on numerous podcasts. Over the years, I've been given the chance to speak to many groups online and, occasionally, in person. I've accepted the rewarding challenge of teaching a course based on the book, which is available online via Zoom or as a podcast put out by the Canadian Council of The Blind. I've called this course Unseen Touchscreen. While these opportunities have not, for the most part, resulted in financial gain, they have given me a sense of purpose and accomplishment. I've found that this has grown from a one-time project into an ongoing vocation. In a society where the first thing people want to know about us is what we do, having something like this book to point to is tremendously helpful to one's sense of self-worth. Nobody can take away the impact that I've had through this book and other efforts which have grown from it.
    While the opportunities I've gotten through using my iPhone haven't typically enriched me directly, there have been occasional rewards of a financial nature. The most unexpected and spectacular being the iPhone 16 Pro I received while working on the third edition. A group of very kind people who valued my efforts held a fundraiser so they could purchase me an iPhone. The money needed was raised within a day of the fundraiser going live. I'm still absolutely blown away by that. I've also received occasional gift cards from thankful souls from time to time.
    The capabilities offered by my iPhone have certainly saved me a lot of money and rewarded me in other ways. They have enriched my personal life with uncounted pleasures and points of meaningful interaction with others that I would never have otherwise experienced. These things have real value to me, and they'll have value to other blind people. In turn, these blind people will be more able to add value to the societies they are more fully able to engage with.
    I'm unemployed and on a fixed income. Counterintuitively, part of the reason for my benevolent act is the many rules surrounding this fixed income. When you introduce extra uncertain income that fluctuates radically from month to month, there's a danger of actually losing more and falling short in a given month as the systems can't adjust quickly. I would need to report any income to two separate government agencies. One of these provides social assistance, while the other makes the apartment I inhabit affordable on that fixed income. Breaking the rules around either agency could make things much harder going forward. Frankly, there wouldn't be enough steady income realized through selling this guide to make it worth the risk. The audience for this sort of thing is mainly blind people, their friends, and family, and perhaps, dare I hope?, some interested sighted app developers. We're not dealing with a bestseller here. For all its faults, the social support provided to people with disabilities who can't find work has given me a safe and secure economic and physical space to inhabit. From this vantage point, I'm all too aware of how many hardworking people live far more precarious lives despite all of their exhausting efforts.
    With my moderate hearing loss, sleep disorder and spacial difficulties in addition to total blindness, I don't see how I could fit into the kind of well-paying job it would take to earn enough to thrive. Thanks to the social safety net in my country, I can turn my best waking hours to contemplating and executing large projects on my own schedule. I can work on things which give me purpose and are helpful to others. Projects like this book. Consider this an example of what's possible when the constant worry about how to survive is removed from the equation. This is what can happen when we're given space to look beyond our own circumstances and share our gifts with others. Unless a way is found to eliminate the need for social assistance, I would much rather see people benefit from my efforts and reap whatever unexpected rewards come my way while moving onto the next project. If there were a way to earn a secure living offering people this kind of help gaining the most enjoyment and fulfillment from their iOS devices and other technologies, I would indeed be very interested. Most especially if that career didn't involve the pressure to sell products. I've never felt comfortable in the role of salesman.
    The path that led me to write the first edition of this guide stretches back to the unexpectedly favourable response I received after publishing the original Personal Power guide and lectures in 2009. I wrote the original Personal Power guide to help blind people who had obtained computers running Microsoft Windows and powerful screen-reading software. They were left without any idea of the many things these computers could help them do to enrich their personal lives. The guide ended up helping far more people than I ever imagined. These people were a somewhat different but no less deserving group than those whom I had actually written that guide for. I was in a South African newspaper, interviewed for several podcasts, and spoke to many online groups interested in what I had done. Add to these responses thousands of appreciative emails. Many of these were from countries I had never heard of. To everyone who took the time to write to me, thank you very much for being the positive proof that my efforts made a real difference. It is largely because of such a response to my initial guide that I felt I could once again step up to the plate and offer something helpful and meaningful here.
    By the time I chose to get my first iPhone, there seemed to be plenty of help for blind users already available. All my friends, both online and off, seemed to have a good grasp of what their iOS devices could do and where to find out what they didn't know. For several years, I didn't realize how blessed I was to be in a large and well-connected social circle. I don't tend to consider myself to be all that special. While I believe that's a good attitude to have overall, it can lead to presumptions that others are just as fortunate in their company and circumstances. Over time, these presumptions began to erode as I encountered people with iOS devices who were truly shocked when I spoke about a technique, capability, or app I had used for years. This included things I regard as absolutely basic and essential to know to do much at all with the expensive devices they owned. For example, many people were never told about the VoiceOver screen reader. Generous friends or family would give blind people iPods, iPads, or iPhones as gifts. They would show them Siri, the digital assistant that you talk to. The presumption of these well-meaning sighted people was that Siri made these devices accessible to blind people. Sadly, most sighted people are completely unaware of the VoiceOver screen reader included in every iOS device that actually serves this purpose.
    Without learning about and using VoiceOver, the built-in screen reader that Apple includes free of charge with these devices, there are a great many things blind people will not be able to do without sighted assistance. They won't be able to shop in the app store for life-changing apps that would read their mail, or tell them where they were. They couldn't review their calendar or reminders. Once VoiceOver has been mastered, these same things, plus a great many more, are easily accomplished without needing any help from sighted people.
    The more I looked into why these unfortunate blind owners of the same devices that had made such a powerful difference to me were left out, the less able I was to rest easy in my enjoyment. These people weren't living under a rock or anything unusual. Circumstances had simply worked against their finding out about the growing online community and resources enjoyed by those of us who had been well-connected. It's not caused by any lack of drive or laziness. Rather, it is the same kind of genuine unawareness that results in a blind person slipping on a patch of ice or a handkerchief lying on an already smooth floor.
    There is a real digital divide among blind people that seems to have several major root causes; economics is a large part of it. A statistic often tossed around is that roughly 80% of blind people are unemployed. If money is tight, you're not as likely or able to try new technology unless you have enough experience or information to understand how helpful and cost-saving it will be eventually. This information is out there, but it's still a case of being connected to the right people or organizations who are forward-thinking enough to stay informed. Sometimes, direct experience is the only way to be convinced enough to invest time, effort, and money into something very different and new. While iOS devices are widespread, the knowledge necessary to demonstrate the VoiceOver screen reader is not. Nor do many people know which apps are accessible and easy to grasp for blind beginners.
    Another big reason is conceptual. At a purely intuitive gut level, it seems absurd that a device with a touchscreen would be at all useful, much less truly coveted, among blind people. Knowledge of how VoiceOver and other accessibility features work isn't widely spread among sighted people who sell these devices. Everyone knows about the famous digital assistant called Siri. However, comparatively few know about the remarkable built-in screen reader called VoiceOver, which was developed specifically for blind users. There's no widespread sense of how capable it is and how many entirely different apps it makes accessible to blind users. Without such information, it's difficult to make a good case to a potential blind owner. Harder still for that owner to conceive of the possibilities without being able to try things out.
    The summer of 2016 was a pivotal one. During those hot months, my wife Sara and I attended a reunion at the W. Ross MacDonald school for the blind in Brantford, Ontario. Had it not been for her involvement with the school alumni, I might never have gone to one of these reunions. During that occasion, I had several key conversations with fellow attendees which would have far-reaching effects on what this guide has ultimately become.
    Later that Summer, Sara and I went on a week-long trip to visit our good friend Stephen Murgaski. Leaving my laptop at home, I simply brought my iPhone and accessories along. I had begun using it for writing my blog entries and was contemplating starting a more serious writing project using the Ulysses app. During that week away, I didn't miss my more bulky laptop at all. I could do everything I wanted to with the iPhone and a Bluetooth keyboard, which served me well for years before a drink spilled on it. I remarked on this to Steve during one of the marvellous conversations we always have while together. He does a splendid job at being devil's advocate. We explored the potential gains and shortcomings of using an iPhone as a computer replacement over the rest of the week. While I failed to convince him that I was right beyond my own personal use case, we discussed a broad range of situations and areas of utility. This exploration has deeply impacted my approach to this guide. He has been a good friend and sounding board for my approaches to explanations throughout the writing process.
    A couple of other pieces fell into place during that trip. One of these was listening to an audiobook by Chuck Klosterman called But What If We're wrong. In this book, Chuck explores the premise that we might one day look at things we're very certain of now quite differently. We might, in fact, view what we currently consider matters of fact, with the same kind of scorn and derision as we level against notions like an Earth-centred universe. He covers a series of things such as which pop culture would ultimately stand the test of time and areas of physics that might undergo radical changes in understanding such as gravity, etc. He puts forward the idea that we can be trapped within a false sense of certainty, strengthened by living in an age of so much shared information.
    Reading this book put me in a good frame of mind to examine all my thoughts that there was sufficient available help for blind people who had iOS devices but weren't as well-connected as I was. Perhaps, I was wrong, and it wasn't due to simple indifference and apathy. Perhaps, there were other causes I hadn't considered. Maybe, my vantage point was more skewed by a social bubble I hadn't even been conscious of as it formed around me.
    The final push came through hearing from a volunteer who had read some remarks I had made about the KNFB Reader app. He wanted to put me in touch with a lady named Joann who he thought I might be able to help. She had an iPhone, but had never been shown how to use VoiceOver. She had also never learned of the KNFB Reader app. Nor had the representatives of an organization helping blind people who she had contacted. Once I had returned home, Joann and I had several conversations over the rest of the summer. These gave me a far better grasp of how lucky I was to have the resources and friends that I do. Joann also clearly illustrated to me how tragically likely people were to remain ignorant of the very resources I had taken for granted and presumed everyone knew about. Quickly, as I explained the various aspects of iOS to her, I sensed the need for a guide like the one I have written here. Had I never learned about or spoke with Joann, this guide would never have happened. Her situation gave me the final push and radically changed the three and a half years it took me to bring the first edition of this project to a satisfactory conclusion. She provided me the newcomer's perspective that all my experience and skill had largely robbed me of. What sticks in my mind most powerfully was her absolute joy when, for the first time, she was able to take a community flyer and read it on her dining room table using the KNFB Reader app.
    Another big problem faced by blind owners of iPhones is that Apple doesn't provide many starting instructions for anyone. A book I thoroughly enjoyed on my iPhone, The One Device by Brian Merchant, offers interesting insights on this. One of the creators of the iPhone commented that the prevailing thought was if you had to ship a user manual, you had already failed to create a compelling device. For a large slice of the general public, this philosophy really seems to have been correct. People who can see do find these products quite intuitive once they get started. When my father bought his iPad, a helpful salesperson made certain he understood how to navigate and knew where to find the manual in the Apple Books app. Back then, it was called iBooks. This didn't take longer than ten or fifteen minutes. For blind people to receive comparable assistance would frankly require considerably more time. I would want at least an hour to go over basic concepts and teach enough for someone to then be able to take their device home and have a satisfactory experience exploring its capabilities on their own. VoiceOver just isn't intuitive enough without any initial instructions telling new owners about VoiceOver and directing them to the built-in tutorial.
    Even if a salesperson shows a blind customer some VoiceOver basics enough to get into Apple Books, it is doubtful they know enough about VoiceOver to give sufficient instructions. The new user must know how to obtain, navigate, and read the user guide freely available in Apple Books using VoiceOver. Doing this well requires a good grasp of numerous VoiceOver gestures and abilities. A "Getting Started" card that helps sighted people know enough to learn through experimentation comes with iOS devices. However, there is no such card for blind users. This is a profoundly unfortunate situation, since neither the possibilities nor operating techniques are anywhere near as intuitive at the start.
    This is particularly the case when blind people are given these devices as gifts or when they are ordered online. I've talked to blind people who heard how accessible iOS devices were supposed to be. They ordered an iPhone online and tried to make it work, expecting that there would be enough instructions to help them. Most often, they had to find sighted help to even get it turned on and set up to the point where they could use Siri. Unless such sighted help was familiar with the Accessibility section in the Settings, they wouldn't know about VoiceOver or other accessibility tools built into iOS. Having a built-in tutorial for VoiceOver should help people running iOS 18 or later tremendously. People on devices which are too old for this will miss out on this valuable resource.
    Adding to the problem, organizations supposed to help blind people simply weren't as aware of developments as I had presumed them to be. Given the many incredibly useful apps and possibilities like GPS guidance, object identification via the built-in camera, and apps capable of reading printed pages in mere seconds, such as VdScan, it seems criminal that this was ever the case. It is particularly sad that this ignorance is more frequently found in more remote areas where the benefits of these devices would be most useful.
    Thankfully, this landscape of ignorance has drastically improved since I started this project. Blindness organizations and agencies have truly awakened to the potential contained in smartphones and tablets. There are now all sorts of training initiatives and programs to help blind people obtain both the devices and the training needed to get started. I'll steer you to some of these many resources in a section at the end of this guide.
    Knowledge of communities like www.applevis.com where blind people can find out about accessible apps as well as tutorials is not very widespread among the general public. This means that even if blind people figure out enough to get online, they don't know where to go. The user guide available in Apple Books would be helpful, provided that a new blind owner was aware of Apple Books and understood how to use it.
    Presuming you gain knowledge of VoiceOver and the skills to use what's already on your iOS device, there's yet another uphill battle that I sincerely hope this guide helps blind people win. The expression "There's an app for that!" has become very familiar in the sighted world. If accessible apps were as widely talked about and advertised as popular and accessible games and apps, blind people might connect the dots as many sighted people do and think to check the app store to see if there's an app that will do what they require. Outside of initiatives like Living Blindfuly, AppleVis, and other blindness related initiatives, however, not a lot of attention is usually paid to apps made especially for the blind. Moreover, there is as yet no way to search specifically for apps that are known to be accessible to blind people and support the VoiceOver screen reader. While a collection of "apps that support VoiceOver" can be found under the Quick Links heading in the app store, it's a small and very infrequently maintained collection.
    For example, nothing was there to tell me that the app that my bank developed for people to use was accessible to me as a blind person. Given past experience, the natural assumption would be that I'd be wasting my time trying it. Yet, when I did try it, I was amazed at how very intentionally accessible it turned out to be. It's even better and more convenient than the completely audio telephone banking I used for decades. I haven't called that number in years now thanks to this banking app. The developers even responded to constructive criticism and improved the app's accessibility over time.
    Sadly, people are still vastly more likely to come across inaccessible apps if they do decide to look around. The path to satisfaction and real competence is far easier to find for sighted people. If my father decided one day that he wanted to garden, fish, brew beer, or damned near anything else, he wouldn't have to try very hard to find an app that would be in some way helpful to the endeavour of his choice. For blind people attempting the same thing, they must also determine whether an app is accessible with VoiceOver. The description of an app often makes it seem like a certainty that it would be accessible. However, after purchasing the app and running the word processor, calculator, text-based, story-driven game that piqued their interest and sounds like it ought to be accessible, they find that it, in fact, isn't. The new blind user may quickly stop experimenting if he or she finds too many inaccessible apps before being pointed to the thousands of fully accessible ones. Nobody who makes accessible apps has the advertising budget to make it generally known that blind people can use them. Therefore, they might never discover that their bank's app is as accessible as mine turned out to be. They might never find a writing app that suits their needs if they start with the idea that it isn't worth trying to look for accessible apps that absolutely exist. They might never delight in the extensive efforts by many developers to create welcoming, accessible experiences for blind users who dare to venture into the world of the touchscreen.
    Meanwhile, for sighted newcomers, it's easy to become downright overwhelmed with information about apps that are totally useable for them. The possibilities are seen everywhere, from popular TV shows to ads seen on Facebook while playing games. A major objective I have in writing this guide is to point blind people to a great many fully accessible apps, so they have positive initial experiences with their iOS device.
    These barriers can leave blind people walking around with very powerful life-changing devices that they can barely use at all. They don't know what they're missing out on. Nor, most likely, do those who help blind people accomplish things that they, if properly equipped and informed, could easily do for themselves. This unfortunate circumstance bothers me deeply, nagging at my conscience. Especially when all that it would take to solve the problem is having the right information available. Precisely the situation I found regarding Windows computers when I wrote the original Personal Power guide. Sadly, history really does repeat itself.
    In this case, the sense of missed opportunity is exponentially more profound. There's no outcry because the dots simply haven't been connected in the common mind. It's different for me. Those dots are very much connected. I'm certain that there is a lot of potential for good among blind people, who have thus far been left out of the growing community taking advantage of this new portable economic space. If these people are let in, everyone wins. They will have an affordable means of engaging with the online world. The more blind people there are who use these devices, the greater our engagement with the online world and our economic leverage will become. They simply need a boost up the initially steep learning curve to a point where they're connected with the online community of helpful people and resources.
    Although I've discovered a lot on my own over the years of using my iPhone, I write this guide while standing on the shoulders of generous giants. Please take the time to explore the resources I've listed in the Helpful Resources section located at the end of the guide. Many of these resources were around to help me get started on my own journey with iOS devices. A good many other friends and family helped get me out of jams my explorations got me into. You can read a little about them in the Acknowledgements. Consider this guide to be my way of passing the generosity that I experienced onward.
    If this guide enables someone to connect more with the people around them, share their enthusiasm and interests online, express themselves, travel and exercise with greater confidence, or enjoy the many digital entertainments that I've been blessed to enjoy, then I will count this project a success. I will consider myself even more richly rewarded if readers of this guide choose to share their talents, personal interests, and knowledge with the online community I have hopefully enabled you to connect with. Tell us about your discoveries of accessible apps or techniques for getting things done using iOS. Share your adventures in the form of reviews of apps and postings to blogs or social media so that others can benefit from your success. Be a positive part of the online world that I've come to appreciate so deeply. Having that world grow richer and more vibrant through your efforts and shared experiences will be reward enough for me.
    Keeping this guide up to date becomes necessary due to many circumstances. Over time, the iOS experience changes as improvements to iPhones as well as the software they run are made. This eventually means that the gap between what was written in a prior edition becomes too different from what a beginner will encounter. These differences might be great enough to cause confusion. Another issue is that apps appear and disappear over time. More suitable apps for certain tasks or for use as examples will emerge from time to time. Sadly, economics dictate that some apps won't be popular or well-maintained enough as change occurs and will be pulled from the app store. Apps designed specifically for smaller segments of iPhone owners are particularly vulnerable to this. Also, all sorts of things can change how online life happens. With this guide, I have always sought to go beyond the technical and equip any newcomers to online life with the knowledge they need to thrive and conduct themselves safely. All of these factors may mean that enough has changed to make an updated edition of this guide necessary.
    In my quest to share what Apple has made it possible to equip myself with, I lack the resources and infrastructure to distribute this guide in alternative formats to those who would benefit tremendously from this being done for them. All I can really do is set this loose on the Internet in the hope that the right people will find it and pass it on to where it'll do the most good. Please pass this guide to whomever you think should read it. If I had my way, it would be on every iOS device owned by a blind person and would be as simple as possible to access and learn about. Any organization or library for the blind should feel free to post this guide in any format. All I ask is that I be given proper credit for my work and that the content not be changed beyond whatever is necessary to produce this guide in alternative formats or make it easier to navigate.

A Fond Farewell:
What a long way we've come together. From setting up your device, to online shopping, to using the camera, I hope you've gained a good idea of the large number of possibilities that exist for your iOS device. That is my main goal with this book. Despite only a fraction of the total apps created being accessible to blind users, the scope of what that small flat slab of tech can allow us to easily accomplish still amazes me. I hope that I've also convinced you that the online world that it lets you access is meaningful and has substance; that it is worthy of your participation. For me, it has provided a place where I can be of real help to people and have an impact. It is a place where I feel that I have a voice. Through your iPhone, I hope that you will choose to step forward and help shape online life for the better. While I look forward to more adventures in the so-called "real world", I don't intend to turn my back on the good I can do in the digital space. It truly has value.
    This edition was created entirely in the Ulysses app. It continues to improve steadily and has-gained the ability to generate an interactive table of contents. This was the only thing I needed to use the Pages app for.
    Work on editing this edition has already begun before this farewell was started. For the first pass through, I'm using the ElevenReader app to read my book in an excellent, natural sounding AI-driven narration voice. I can pick from a wide variety including such famous actors as Sir Lawrence Olivier, Burt Reynolds and James Dean among others. I can pick out mistakes as I hear them, pause the reading, and pounce on the area of concern, making changes in the Ulysses app quickly. The Apple Intelligence writing tools just aren't ready to be trusted with proofreading large blocks of text. I always end up with an extra copy of the text despite telling it to replace it with the corrected version. I have somewhat more trust in the expert system built into Ulysses, which proceeds step by step, giving me the chance to decide what to do about mistakes it finds.
    Creating this guide has been a much longer and far more exhaustive process than I had originally thought it would be. Keeping it updated is quite an ongoing effort. Change is a constant in the iOS ecosystem. The goal posts just never stop moving. Some truly great apps have disappeared, and new ones have come along. We've had three major iOS updates. The slow emergence of Apple Intelligence seems like it'll be a large enough change to demand a fourth edition be ready for release in a couple of years.
    People seem to appreciate my snapshot takes on how the world is doing from my perspective. I began writing the farewell remarks for this edition on the early morning of the first of may. I always seem to be finishing editions of my book around when Earth Day is celebrated. Earth Day was observed, but given the triumph of politicians who deny climate change in the name of political expedience, it's hard to remain very hopeful. A couple of years ago, smoke was absolutely everywhere in early Summer. The people in charge of my apartment complex covered the airflow intakes with metal sheets in an attempt to keep out smoke from wildfires burning in another province. The smoke from those fires drifted as far south as New York, as well as across Canada. There was no relief from the acrid smell. Using air conditioning might have cooled the air, but it would have been too toxic to breathe. Had I needed a wake-up call about the reality of climate change, that would have been more than sufficient proof for me. I sincerely don't want to have this become a part of normal life. The more carbon we put into the air, the more likely that eventuality is.
    Even more alarming to me is the drift towards selfish defensive thinking which is taking root in North America right when we most need its opposite. The trust that we Canadians have had in the US for more than the five decades I've lived has been totally shattered by Trump's actions in a matter of months. There's a palpable anger towards the US now. The cup of Jumping Bean Dark Roast coffee I sip from is emphatically Canadian. It's delicious, and its galvanizing bitterness is quite emblematic of our increasingly absurd reality. Until a few months ago, I never would have given a second thought to which country produced the coffee I enjoy, the chair I sit in, the food I eat. Now, my fellow Canadians and I are ever so conscious of supporting an economy whose administration wants to annex my country. My American designed iPhone, manufactured in China, makes it possible for me to show my very real but heretofore quiet patriotism through my wallet. I do this with said iPhone by choosing Canadian made products and acquiring them through another American giant called Amazon, which has been ever so successful here. I'll show that patriotism as often as is at all practical. Canada is a far from perfect place, but we get plenty of things right. I just wish it didn't take quite as much pushing for us to get to the point of remedial action.
    As someone whose life has been improved in many profound ways by American ingenuity, these sweeping political changes are nothing short of appalling. There's a deep sense of betrayal that I doubt most Americans are at all conscious that their government has unleashed. Such sharp abandonment of leadership roles The US has had on climate action, health initiatives and science has happened in such a short time. These changes will cost lives well beyond their borders.
    I very much worry about the efforts underway to repeal laws in the US which concern accessibility. People in the prime of health don't realize how close they are to having a temporary or permanent disability. Leading conversations for a local group of people who have lost their vision recently, I have a deeper sense of how true that is. I would hate to see what accessibility and inclusion relate legislation which has been so hard fought for in Canada come under similar attack from people who can't see beyond their own wallets. These are profoundly unsettling times for anyone with even a small dash of common sense, honesty and moral decency.
    Being geographically attached to the US and saturated by American cultural and media influence, Canada really can't escape the selfish populist headwinds. I'm glad to see that more Canadians are appreciating and standing up for our more humane approach to those who are less fortunate in health and wealth. However, I worry that our resolve might not be able to withstand the rising protectionist darker sentiments, normally more dormant in Canadian culture. We too are losing our ability to find compromise as our sense of economic and existential peril increases. The US doesn't have a monopoly on people who want to burn it all down. One of the most divisive politicians we've ever had just came far too close to being our prime minister for me to have any sense of comfort.
    There are bright spots of hope out there. I hear and read more every day about people who are doing their part and helping each other. There are people working on all sorts of collaborative projects and imaginative approaches to inequality and climate change. In particular, city governments still seem to have their sights set on these issues. One source looking hard for much-needed good news is called Reasons To Be Cheerful. It's a website and publication which has definitely lifted my spirits. Check them out at:
    https://reasonstobecheerful.world
    I'm also happy to hear that not all corporations are slashing their initiatives when it comes to diversity, inclusion, and accessibility. Thankfully, Apple has stood its ground when it comes to its accessibility initiatives and its more humane stance. Accessibility does indeed seem to be a deeply rooted part of what Apple does. Enough for me not to be overly concerned about this changing at the whim of current political trends. Over the past month, VoiceOver has turned twenty years old. It has been a truly transformative part of my life since 2011, adding endless incredible possibility to a flat, smooth rectangle of glass I keep with me everywhere.
    Global Accessibility Awareness day will arrive on May 15th. I'm very hapy to be able to publish this book on that special day as my own contribution. If things proceed as they traditionally have, Apple will reveal some of what we can expect in terms of new or improved accessibility features coming to iOS. From an accessibility standpoint, iOS 18 had a lot to offer and was far from disappointing. I frankly need a Summer break from working on this book. However, I keenly look forward to finding out what to expect in the Fall from iOS 19.
    So much historical change is happening that it makes one's head spin. Against such a backdrop, it's hard not to feel that one's efforts are rather insignificant. There are so many large-scale problems which I would love to help solve. However, I've been given an increased sense of purpose from many of you, my readers. Around thirty of you got together and funded the iPhone 16 Pro, on which I write these words. Many more of you indicated your willingness to contribute. Still more of you have reached out via email and social media with kind appreciation and tales of what you've managed to find or accomplish through your iPhones. All of that is very meaningful to me. The more I hear about the good you do through knowing how to use your iPhones, the more of a sense I'll have that I've accomplished something worth-while.
    Readers have indicated that they've enjoyed learning a little about what I'm up to beyond the guide. It has become a tradition for me to indulge such curiosity in these final remarks. On a personal level, I'm feeling much more connected these days. The Unseen Touchscreen course I conduct for the Canadian Council of the Blind has been attracting people from across Canada over the past few years. It continues to go along very well. It gives me a group of people who attend regularly enough to begin to know. They continue to ask excellent questions and are eager to make the best possible use of their iPhones to enrich their lives. I'm honoured that they have continued to find it worth their time to attend my cessions.
    Meetings with my local chapter of the CCB have been similarly rewarding. Hearing loss makes me value these online connections even more, since it's easier to participate when I'm in control of my sound environment. However, now that the pandemic is behind us, we are slowly beginning to have more in-person meetings. Those can be more taxing with hearing aids, but with people truly interested in engaging, they're still very enjoyable and stimulating. I've been happy to discover that my appetite for such gatherings hasn't diminished.
    I'm also involved in helping to lead another local group sponsored by the CNIB. They are all dealing with sight loss. For a number of them, this has happened quite recently. I'm still figuring out how I can best contribute to their journeys into what I've known as normal all my life. I learned to understand what limits being blind placed on me as I grew up in a family keen to expand my horizons and chance for success as much as possible. The people I'm encountering have suddenly had their jobs end and options drastically reduced, as if someone threw a switch and turned off the world as they knew it. I try to make them aware of as much of what is possible as I can, while realizing that it takes a long time to adjust and begin to find new purpose and meaning.
    Participating in the Kelly and Company show continues to be rewarding, despite the fairly drastic changes to the show's format. I no longer cover technology but am still sharing what I find regarding entertainment which is accessible to blind people. I make appearances every second week, which people seem to be enjoying. Absolutely all of the work related to this is done on my iPhone.
    I'm hopeful this year of being able to celebrate the release of the third edition with some friends in person this time around. Perhaps not on the day of release, but soon thereafter. More people who I've come to know in person have a sense of what I've been up to. I'll hopefully be doing more socially over this coming Summer. I'm much more experienced getting around using Uber. It's at least affordable for local trips. Finding people interested in taking those trips is finally starting to seem like an actual possibility. Making new friends is a slow, hard process, but I feel like its happening.
    I've obtained some Braille RPG dice and hope to put them to use participating in a game at some point. The chances are probably better finding an online group these days. Either way, my iPhone will doubtless be of tremendous help.
    Two larger creative dreams also still beckon to me. I believe I've gathered all of the resources I need to take a good crack at either of them. Ever since my days in secondary school, I've dreamed of writing a collection of loosely connected short stories. Increasingly, the idea I have for these stories is turning into more of the outline of a novel. My other big, long-standing creative dream is to create a widely enjoyable game. I've come to the conclusion that perhaps a roleplaying game would be workable. It would share the same world as the novel but allow things to unfold in countless different ways. Slowly, I've gathered books and materials about writing, stories, and game design. It's all ready and waiting on my iPhone.
    Working on this guide really needs to remain my primary focus. People definitely seem to appreciate the approach I take. However, I'm hoping to make slow progress in organizing my thoughts on the near future Earth on which the core story takes place. I'll likely lean towards working on the novel first. I think that imagination is our best shot at coming up with the kinds of empathy, humility, and capacity for change that we'll need to find our way out of this darker patch of history moving at headlong speed.
    We have at last arrived at the end of this guide. If you've actually read this whole thing, you have my profound admiration and thanks. I didn't write it with that kind of persistence as the expectation. The idea was that people would skip around to what they were interested in or felt they needed at any given moment. I sincerely hope you have found it worth your time.
    Fifteen years is long enough to have given me a real sense of history happening in this world built by Apple and those of us who jumped aboard their iPhone train. I've been honoured to have experienced works of genius that are simply no longer available. Through countless online conversations, I've witnessed a lot of tremendous creative good take place. Having a sense of the economic forces and other factors at play will hopefully put you in a better position to direct your time and efforts to advocate for improvements thoughtfully. Over all, I've found that app developers in particular have been eager to include accessibility once they're made aware of the possibility to do so and of serious interest from people unable to use their creations due to various disabilities which can be accommodated with some effort and consideration.
    This is, by far, the largest single ongoing project I've ever undertaken. That saying about great art being abandoned rather than finished rings very true to me. I've included all of the wisdom and discoveries I could think to. Making over a decade's worth of experience available in a single document is a very tall order. I wish that I had made this a collaborative project from a very early point. By the time I got to a place where I considered it, I was in too deeply to let go of control. Especially of the overall friendly tone that I consider so important. To really do a complete all-encompassing job of this would take a team of people with more skill, varied interests and life experience. For better or worse, you're stuck with me. This book will remain my personal project for as long as I can keep going. My thanks to everyone who has come forward with suggestions and questions which help me make it a better resource. Thanks are also extended to those of you who share Personal Power and make this book available in other formats increasing its spread and accessibility. It means a great deal to me as well as the people I continue to hear from who have received the book through these efforts.
    You now know quite a bit about what keeps me cheerful and fascinated. If you've enjoyed that process, I'd love to hear from you. Of course, I'm interested in what you thought of the guide. Has it helped you? Is there something you wish that I had thought to include? A fourth edition of this guide is definitely on the way. I'm very interested in hearing about the adventures you have with your iOS devices. Just as others have helped me, I'm happy to answer your questions if I can. I'm also just as happy to have a good conversation about life, the universe, and everything. Reach me on Mastodon at "@mfeir@mstdn.social". Otherwise, there's email. Contact me at michael.feir@gmail.com.
    Until the next edition, I hope you keep safe and healthy, do what good in the world you can, and increase happiness.
