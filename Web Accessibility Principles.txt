WebAIM Quick Reference: Web Accessibility Principles 

Principles of Accessibility 

1 Perceivable - Available through sight, hearing, or touch. 
23 Operable - Compatible with keyboard, mouse, voice control, and other devices. 
4 Understandable - Easy to comprehend. 
5 Robust - Works across browsers, assistive technologies, mobile devices, etc. Follows standards.

Alternative Text 

6 Every non-text element needs a text equivalent (often conveyed in the alt attribute) to provide an alternative to the image content. 
7 The alt attribute should present the content and function of an image, but not necessarily a detailed description. 
8 If an image is decorative, or redundant to nearby text, it should have empty alternative text (alt=""). 
9 If an image is a link or hotspot, the alt text must describe the link's function. 
• Words like "picture of," "image of," or "link to" are redundant. Screen readers already identify images and links by default. 
• Ensure alternative text is as succinct as necessary.

Readability 

• Use the simplest language appropriate to your content and audience. 
• Use white space (line length, text spacing) to improve readability. 
• Supplement text with images and icons. 
• Check spelling, grammar, and reading grade level.  
Content Navigation  

• Create semantic structure with regions, headings, and lists. 
• Provide a skip link to help users get straight to the main page content.  
Data Tables 

• Identify data table headers with <th scope="col"> for column headers and <th scope="row"> for row headers. 
• If appropriate, add a <caption> for the data table..

Color 
• Position form labels adjacent to or near their controls, so the labels are associated visually. 
• Use <label> to associate labels with controls programmatically. 
• Use <fieldset> and <legend> to group related controls 
(like radio buttons) with a higher-level label. 
• Clearly identify required form elements. Don't make a field required if it is not necessary. Ensure all directions and cues are readily accessible. 
• Ensure validation errors are obvious to screen reader users, and that users can easily make corrections and resubmit the form.

Links and Buttons  

• Ensure links and buttons contain descriptive text. 
• Avoid generic phrases such as "click here", "here", "more", "more information", "read more", "continue," etc. 
• Ensure links can be visually differentiated from other page content. 
Multimedia  

• Videos and live audio must have captions and a transcript. 
• Captions must be synchronized, equivalent, and accessible. 
• Archived audio must have a transcript. > webaim.org/techniques/captions/ 
Documents  

• For the most robust accessibility, use HTML instead of proprietary document formats. 
• When only a document will do, PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel provide basic accessibility features. 
• If document content cannot be made fully accessible, provide an accessible alternative. 
• Test document accessibility in a screen reader.

1 Color can enhance comprehension, but do not use color alone to convey information. Be especially cautious of red/green color combinations. 
2 Ensure that text, icons, and user interface elements have strong luminance contrast..

4 Ensure that content reflows without breaking layout up to 400% zoom (from a 1280 pixel wide viewport). 
5 Ensure responsive layouts and structures are keyboard accessible. Provide a descriptive page <title>. 
6 Ensure functionality available to mouse users is also available via the keyboard. 
7 Make all scripted and dynamic content, dialog pop-ups, and page widgets available to screen readers. ARIA, when used 
appropriately, can be helpful. 
8 Ensure the web page language is defined (e.g., <html lang="en">). 
9 Implement and test to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
