[]When our team set out to survey, research, and write this year’s State of Digital Accessibility Report, we could not have predicted how different the world would be when it came time to publish it. Six months later, we find ourselves in the most challenging business environment of the last 100 years. Organizations are picking and choosing expenditures with exceptional care. Funds for digital accessibility might seem a “want” rather than a “need.” My ask to all of you is to fight that view: in this time, more than ever before, digital accessibility is critical to the health and safety of people with disabilities.

Based on the welcome and rapid response by the global scientific community we know a lot about COVID-19 and its impacts. Based on the data, one inescapable conclusion is clear: the disease will have a disproportionate, negative impact on vulnerable populations – chief among those, people with disabilities. If the community we support, people with disabilities, cannot safely shop for food, access state and local government communications, get health services, and connect to distance learning and working opportunities safely, via the medium of the Internet, that community will be endangered. 

We can deflect a portion of that danger by working with redoubled energy toward inclusion. In all times, we have refused to accept a world where people with disabilities are treated as secondclass citizens. Now the stakes are higher. Now we are called to a greater mission and great impact. Heed the call.

Years from now, when COVID-19 is behind us, the dust has settled, and we’re back to some sort of normal, you will have to ask yourself if you have done all you could to protect your customers and constituents. Digital accessibility is a key part of that. Help your organization see that. In doing that, you’ll help protect a community and do some good.

This report can play a part in that. Our belief is that accessibility practitioners do something good that is also defensible as an investment. Work in this field must be able to stand up to the robust scrutiny all technology investments face. This report is contribution to standing up to that scrutiny. It can help justify immediate investments in accessibility and guide the long-term maturation of your program. Our hope is that it provides a set of tools you can use to benchmark your program and understand where and how investments in digital accessibility can have their largest impact for people with disabilities. 

I look forward to journeying with all of you as we grow and mature together over the coming years and decades. As a group of practitioners, we can help achieve the goal of enabling all people to live their best lives through access to technology.

Stay safe out there.

For accessibility professionals and all stakeholders involved in digital inclusion, the results of the 2020 State of Digital Accessibility survey will mark a turning point: the more than doubling of respondents year over year reveals a considerably heightened interest in digital accessibility while key data points of the enclosed report show progress among organizations of all sizes over 2019.

We are grateful to our colleagues at Level Access for having taken the initiative of this survey and to the over 1,100 respondents who took the time to respond to its questionnaire. Its results constitute a unique resource for organizations to benchmark their own practices and degree of advancement in implementing digital accessibility with their peers, either by industry or organization size. The report also offers specific gap analysis which often represent “low hanging fruits” for organizations to improve their performance and competitiveness in matters of digital inclusion.

Most importantly, those results provide evidence that in today’s environment, leading companies, universities, and public sector organizations are committing to making their digital channels accessible to persons of all abilities, an even more pressing priority with the COVID-19 pandemic.

From the perspective of IAAP, the International Association of Accessibility Professionals, those results show the heightened level of expertise of its members and the positive impact of its professional certifications in accessibility. This is good news and a well-deserved reward for the many volunteers, experts and staff who have worked relentlessly at promoting the accessibility profession, including colleagues from Level Access.

We encourage all stakeholders involved in accessibility to go through the detailed results of this survey, and to use those to further promote digital inclusion among their organizations, fulfilling our ultimate objective of making our world digitally accessible to all.

Introduction 

Welcome to the State of Digital Accessibility Report, presented by Level Access, G3ict, and IAAP. The 2020 Report draws on the data gathered in the State of Digital Accessibility Survey to provide insights into overall trends in the industry and the digital accessibility programs of organizations large and small.

The 2020 report will cover the following themes:

The State of Accessibility Programs

Among the 1,119 participants in the survey were representatives of nearly every industry group and organization size. The report provides a set of tools to benchmark an accessibility program and understand where and how investments in digital accessibility can have their largest impact—on both the organization and people with disabilities.

Challenges, Risks, and Motivations

Every accessibility program has a story—a spark to get things started, goals to achieve, and obstacles along the way. The report tells these stories through data so organizations maturing an accessibility program will find they are in good company.

Product Development, Design, and Testing

The majority of people who took the 2020 survey identified themselves as responsible for the design, development, and testing of websites, apps, and other digital assets. Insights about tools, training, user testing by people with disabilities, and more will be presented.

Content Creation

Digital accessibility is not limited to code. All content published digitally should be accessible to people with disabilities, including blog posts, documents, emails, webinars, videos, and social media.

[]

The majority of accessibility programs have fewer than 10 team members. This survey question was openended, and many participants wrote in comments like, “I am the accessibility program” or “just me!”  

[][]How many people work primarily on accessibility  in your  organization?

When accessibility is centrally owned, it is by IT or Product.

[]
In 31% of organizations, accessibility is a distributed responsibility. Over 60% of organizations report that the program’s budget is owned by the same department.

[]

What business unit is responsible for digital accessibility?

[]

[]Diversity & Inclusion departments are on the rise.

While just 12% of accessibility programs are managed by Diversity & Inclusion, that number has jumped from a mere 3% in 2019.

[]

[]
[]Roles of Survey Participants

[]

*Consumer Products & Services includes retail, restaurants, travel, hospitality, business services, etc.

[]

Relationships with Accessibility Vendors

  -- ----
     
     []
  -- ----

Partnering with a vendor provides expertise in a very specific technical skillset and access to people with experience building and maturing accessibility programs. Only 24% of survey participants reported a stable relationship with a digital accessibility vendor, with the 22% using a vendor on a case-by-case basis.

[]

Do you have a relationship with a digital accessibility vendor?

Larger organizations are more likely to have a vendor.

The larger the organization, the more likely they were to be partnered with a digital accessibility vendor and the more likely they were to be in a year-to-year or multi-year contract.

  --------------------------------------------------- ------ -------- ------- --------- -----------

Highly regulated and/or highly competitive industries use accessibility vendors.

When the stakes are high, organizations often choose to partner with digital accessibility experts.

[]

Drivers, Goals, and Challenges

All 1,119 survey participants were asked about the reasons why their organization has committed to digital accessibility, the goals they had for their programs, and the challenges those programs face.

[]
Inclusion tops the list of drivers in 2020.

The business drivers for accessibility continue to be a mix of legal risk reduction and the desire to do the right thing. Nearly 68% of participants said that their organization feels compelled to be inclusive of people with disabilities, showing that these drivers can work hand-in-hand.

End-user accessibility plugins and widgets 

Over 66% of the organizations responding to the survey did not use plug-ins as solutions. Plug-in solutions offer insufficient coverage, often fixing minor cosmetic issues without addressing functional access barriers.

Top Five Challenges for Accessibility Programs

A thriving accessibility program does not appear fully formed and perfected; every program has its challenges. Survey respondents were asked to identify the challenges faced by their accessibility programs and five common threads were found.

[]1. Incorporating accessibility earlier in the development lifecycle (56%)

For those involved in the creation of digital properties—product, UX, engineering, etc.— this challenge ranked high. When digital accessibility is only considered after a product is developed, remediation takes more time and energy. It is much more cost-effective to be thinking about inclusive design at the first stages of planning a new product or a new feature for an existing product.

[]2. Training (55%)

[]
Every role listed training in their top three challenges. When the clock is ticking—see #3—it can be hard to make time for professional development.

3. Time (51%)

Time to develop an accessible product — or remediate an inaccessible one — is a common challenge. Developing accessible digital properties can be done on a tight schedule, but only with the proper planning, training, and tools.

4. Access to usability testers who have disabilities. (45%)

While the majority of organizations agree that testing by people with disabilities is important, the majority don’t do it. Many participants commented that budget prevented them from expanding usability testing to include people with disabilities.

[]5. Too many content creators – can’t monitor everything (44%)

Whether content creators are writing code or sharing documents, the never-ending stream of new content can be hard to manage from an accessibility standpoint. This especially rang true for those in higher education who have professors and teaching assistants uploading documents and videos for classes daily.

Product Development

The longer an organization waits to incorporate accessibility, the greater the chance that the product will be inaccessible (or expensive and time-consuming to retrofit). When the product team considers accessibility from the start, they can iterate, test, learn, and end up with a stronger product.

Accessibility teams scale alongside their development team.

While the best situation would be that every developer is trained on and charged with accessibility, the reality is quite different. In fact, 44% of organizations have between one and three people who work primarily on accessibility.

As product development teams grow, so do their accessibility teams. The 2020 survey numbers reported below can be used to justify increased budget for accessibility team members.

[]

Organizations with fewer than 250 developers were most likely to have 1 to 3 people working primarily on accessibility.

[]

[]
90% of development teams think about accessibility before building begins.

[]

What is the earliest time in the systems development life cycle that you start thinking about accessibility?

[]

The most common project to outsource is an accessibility audit or other formal testing of systems once built. (See page 28 for more on audits.) This was followed by captioning and training.

User Experience & Design Systems

[]
Design systems help organizations drive better products to market faster. They can also streamline accessibility—integrating accessible components in a standardized framework to consistently create inclusive user experiences.

The survey showed that organizations that partnered with an accessibility vendor—even short term!— leveraged that relationship to develop a more accessible component library.

[]

[] Organizations that include accessibility when writing product and feature requirements

[]

Organizations that include accessibility in acceptance criteria

[]

The survey asked those in technical roles about user testing by people with disabilities, accessibility testing in continuous integration, and code-level unit tests.

Most organizations are not testing their product with people with disabilities.

[]
While 94% agree that testing by people with disabilities is important, 56% of organizations are not doing it. While automated and manual testing can identify many accessibility barriers, the best way to ensure an inclusive experience is to involve people with disabilities. Their experience is an invaluable part of the development process.

More established programs are more inclusive.

A clear trend appeared in the relationship between age of accessibility program and inclusion of people with disabilities. The older the program, the more likely it was to be inclusive. In fact, the age of accessibility program was more of a predictor than the size of the program or its budget.

Validating accessibility in unit testing

The earlier accessibility issues can be found, the more cost-effective they are to fix. Running accessibility tests alongside standard unit tests is being adopted slowly. The survey revealed that only 21% of organizations are validating accessibility requirements in unit testing. The number jumped to 33% for those in a multi-year relationship with an accessibility vendor.

Testing Tools

Preferences for testing tools change as an accessibility program matures and acquires the knowledge and funding to operate efficiently and effectively.

Browser extensions and page testers

The majority of development teams (84%) reported using browser extensions and page testers. This number rose to 90% for organizations with more than 5,000 employees. The number drops to 74% for organizations where accessibility testing is part of the continuous integration process.

Free tools

[]
The majority of organizations—across all sizes, verticals, and maturity—use free tools. There are many free tools available and, despite their limitations, they can prove useful.

Overlay-based remediation tools

These solutions apply fixes over a website or web app using JavaScript and without altering the code and are typically provided by a blend of automation and manual services. They require extensive maintenance to account for new content and because any changes to the underlying code can break existing fixes. These tools were used by only 7% of development teams.

Plug-ins or widgets for users to alter UI

These tools generally provide assistive options (like text enlargement) that are already available via browser or operating system settings and fail to ensure an accessible experience. The survey found these were used by 32% of development teams and more frequently (44%) in those with short-term relationships with accessibility vendors.

Script-based web monitoring

While only used by 10% of all development teams surveyed, script-based web monitoring was more frequently used by teams with mature accessibility programs (17%), those who rated their accessibility knowledge as advanced (19%) and those who test for accessibility as part of CI practices (19%).

SDKs or automated testing integrations for development

[]
While only 14% of development teams reported using SDKs or automated testing integrations, this number doubled to 28% for those with advanced accessibility knowledge. Other groups with high adoption include those in long-term contracts with an accessibility vendor (23%), those who include accessibility testing as part of CI practices (23%), and organizations with 50k+ employees (35%).

Site scan or web crawl software

Site scans and web crawlers were used by 41% of all development teams. This grew to 58% for accessibility programs between 7-10 years old and 57% for those over 10 years old. Those organizations in a long-term contract with an accessibility vendor were also much more likely (57%) to use site scan or web crawl services than those who had no vendor relationship (32%).

Auditing the Accessibility Audit Report

[]
Many organizations complete digital accessibility audits on key properties. The survey asked those who have had an audit to share their experience, rating each aspect of the audit report as Absolutely Necessary, Very Important, Important, Not Very Important, or Not Necessary.

Absolutely Necessary, Very Important, and Important have been combined here as “Total Positive.”

[]

[]

[]

Advanced teams shared some common features.

For professionals looking to join a team with advanced knowledge in accessibility, these were the common features:

1. Organization Size

•   Fewer than 50 employees

•   [][]
More than 50,000 employees

2. Industry

•   Education

•   Financial Services

•   Accessibility Services

3. Certification

• IAAP-certified employees or contractors

[]

Buying & Selling Accessible Technology

The best way to find out if a piece of technology works for people with disabilities is to ask people with disabilities to test it. The next best thing is to look for documentation: a VPAT (or other accessibility conformance report), and the answers provided in a Request for Proposal (RFP).

The majority of buyers want accessible technology.

The survey found that 55% of organizations have prioritized buying a product or solution because of its accessibility. Only 25% do not ask vendors for any sort of proof of accessibility before purchasing a product or solution.

[]

[]
Do you hold your vendors accountable for digital accessibility?

The RFP process often doesn’t include questions about accessibility.

For those selling technology, the data skews toward RFPs not asking about product accessibility. But when those questions are asked, survey participants say they are confident answering them.

Accessible Content and Communications

Every organization creates content – whether it’s educational materials, marketing collateral, product pages, or digital documents. The survey asked those in content creation roles about the accessibility of the content they produce.

[]
Content velocity makes accessibility challenging.

Static websites are a thing of the past. 45% of respondents reported that they update content daily or even several times a day. With content being published at this rate, accessibility is not a given unless best practices are baked into the content creation process.

[]

How often do you update content on your website(s)?

[]

Everyone knows that captions are important for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, but they are also helpful to those with cognitive disabilities or English language learners. (That’s not even mentioning how many hearing people view videos with their device muted.) The survey found that 90% caption their video content, with 30% of them choosing to outsource the task.

Document accessibility is improving (slowly).

Digital documents have their own set of best practices to ensure accessibility. For those using Microsoft Office, the Accessibility Checker identifies errors and walks the user through remedying them.

PDFs are not as straightforward and can pose challenges, especially issues of reading order for screen reader users. In the survey, 18% admitted that they do not tag their PDFs to make them accessible. This number is down from 23% in 2019.

[]
15% of organizations outsource the task of document accessibility.

Social media accessibility is rising.

In the 2019 survey, only 29% of organizations reported using alt text in social media posts. In 2020, this increased to 45%. In today’s fast-paced world, accessible social media content is a must for any organization that values inclusion.

[][]45% of organizations report using alt text in social media posts.

[]
[]60% of organizations reported that current litigation trends have motivated them to move faster to achieve accessibility compliance.

Legal counsel is key to a successful settlement.

If an organization receives a demand letter or is sued, the first step should be to secure counsel. If internal counsel does not have experience with ADA settlements, there are attorneys and firms that specialize in it.

The survey revealed that 65% of organizations that came under legal scrutiny contacted their internal legal counsel immediately. 22% chose to respond directly to the complaint.

[]

What were the first actions you took upon receiving a notice of a lawsuit filed or a demand letter?

[]

Prepare for significant expenses for legal counsel.

The majority of organizations who used external counsel spent over 40 hours with their attorney(s). Given the hourly rate of a quality attorney, this is no small line item!

+-----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------+

Internal expenses also add up quickly.

The majority of organizations also spent over 40 hours with internal teams, working to resolve the complaint and bring their properties into compliance.

The bottom line: Accessibility now is the budget-friendly choice.

The risk of a lawsuit is still very real, especially for consumer-facing companies, educational institutions, and public sector organizations. Putting accessibility as a must-have line item in the budget will mitigate some of the financial risk posed by lawsuits and demand letters.
