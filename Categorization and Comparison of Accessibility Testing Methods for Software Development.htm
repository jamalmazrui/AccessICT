method relates to impairments and barriers. In this work we have expanded the
W3C cognitive barriers from one category to four categories in order to provide
a better overview of cognitive barriers and testing methods. We also present an
overview of multiple existing accessibility testing methods and what kind of
barriers they cover. Finally, we present a recommendation on how to select a
collection of accessibility testing methods in order to cover the broadest
range of disabilities. Our focus is tools that can empower and ease work
processes of software development teams, including both developers and testers.

</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>The aim of accessibility testing is to
evaluate whether the final solution will be accessible for a wide range of
people, including people with various types of impairments, such as limitations
in vision, hearing, cognition, movement and speech. Accessibility testing is an
important part of a process to achieve universally designed solutions [1]. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>It is challenging, though, to conduct accessibility testing
in an efficient way during the development of software and digital services.
Studies have identified several challenges to usability testing, such as costs,
both in terms of recruiting participants and evaluating the results [2],
difficulties in organizing and integration into work processes [3], and lack of
competence and training [4]. It is therefore not uncommon for user testing to
be neglected in software development [5], [6]. However, companies state that UD
is important, and want more focus on accessibility [7]. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>To further complicate matters, there are few methods, tools
and methodologies that cover all types of impairments and barriers, and it is
hard for testers to know what types of impairments and barriers they have
covered. To ensure a high degree of accessibility, it is necessary to conduct
user testing with a variety of users, but having the software team testing for
accessibility prior to this gives more efficient user testing [1].  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>There is a wide range of methods, guidelines, and
approaches on testing methods for testing accessibility. In this paper, we give
an overview of a number of techniques and actual tools. We focus on testing
methods that can be conducted by all members of a software development team,
categorized according to which kind of barriers they cover. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:27.65pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: After
the discussion of related work within accessibility testing and software
development in Section 2, we propose a particular grouping of barriers to be
used for categorizing the accessibility testing methods in Section 3. After
that we present numerous testing methods with their features in Section 4,
before we discuss our findings in Section 5. We also discuss limitations of our
work in Section 6. Finally, we summarize and highlight future research directions
in Section 7. </p>

<h1 style='margin-left:9.6pt;text-indent:-10.35pt'><span style='line-height:

work </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>The strengths and weaknesses of various
methods have been assessed in previous work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>In a 2005 study, expert review, screen reader, automated
testing and remote user testing were compared to each other [8]. The authors
found that methods where multiple experts and multiple tools were combined gave
the best results. Another finding was that automated web accessibility testing
tools and guidelines alone were inadequate for web designers with little
accessibility experience. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The correct comparison of tools is not a trivial task.
Brajnik proposed the comparison criteria completeness, correctness, and
specifity, developed a detailed comparison process and successfully applied
this process to the task of comparing two accessibility evaluation tools [9].
The process includes a statistical analysis of the recorded data points in
order to be able to quantify error margins, uncertainties, and confidence
intervals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The same author also proposes the criteria validity,
reliability, usefulness, and efficiency for the proper comparison of
accessibility testing methods [10]. The criteria are applied to compare the
methods &quot;barrier walkthrough&quot; and &quot;conformance test&quot;. The
former is based on scenarios and personas with impairments, and the latter
denotes testing according to standards and/or guidelines such as WCAG. The
barrier walkthrough is found to achieve better results than the conformance
test method. More detailed results on the same experiment are given in [11]. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The comparison of methods and tools, however, depends
heavily on the used accessibility model, of which multiple definitions exist
[12]. Moreover, the named work gives a taxonomy of accessibility evaluation
methods and discusses the evaluation of accessibility methods with regard to
the author's own definition of accessibility model, as well as the importance
of context. It also lists the pros and cons of the methods &quot;conformance
review&quot;, &quot;subjective assessment&quot;, &quot;screening techniques&quot;,
&quot;barrier walkthrough&quot;, and &quot;user testing&quot;; however, on a
rather high abstraction level. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The accessibility evaluation method &quot;barrier
walkthrough&quot; is discussed in detail in [13]. The results show that there
should be three to five experienced experts in order to find all problems on a
webpage in a reliable manner. In contrast to this, up to 14 nonexperienced
reviewers are needed to achieve the same quality level, as their assessments
diverge considerably. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Other work focuses on often neglected aspects of
accessibility testing methods, namely their inherent costs and benefits [14].
The authors argue that both differ considerably across testing methods, and
that both aspects thus have to be taken into account for choosing the
appropriate method. Bai have investigated how to prioritize testing methods
from a data perspective, by looking at how many issues they find compared to
the cost of using the tools [15]. An evaluation of different accessibility
testing methods and which methods uncover what type of problems has also been
studied by [16]. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:27.65pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Specifying that &quot;automated testing&quot; or
&quot;semi-automated testing&quot; has been used as evaluation method, however,
is simply not enough, as discussed in [17]. Tools, even though they share the
same purpose, will likely have differing quality in terms of correctness,
completeness, robustness, time consumption, and other parameters. Therefore, it
is not only of importance to choose the correct accessibility evaluation
method, but also to choose an appropriate tool to be used within a particular
method. Also, there are multiple ways in how to apply such tools, and variants
in application order [18]. </p>

<h1 style='margin-left:9.6pt;text-indent:-10.35pt'><span style='line-height:

groups </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Working with accessibility is a negotiation
between diversity and practicality. On the one hand standards and categories
are useful tools when advocating for, and working with accessibility. On the
other hand they can become too broad or too generalizing, which reduces the
diversity in ways of functioning for people in the defined categories [19]. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>It is very challenging to group or categorize impairments
properly, because they are often overlapping in one or several aspects. There
are numerous attempts at grouping various impairments, and no clear consensus
on the optimal approach, neither in information technology nor in medicine.
Impairment categorization is also highly dependent on context.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>From a use of ICT solutions perspective, it can make more
sense to categorize barriers rather than specific diagnoses, such as dementia
or dyslexia, since barriers in ICT are created by a lack of accommodation for
different ways of functioning rather than lack of accommodation for a specific
diagnosis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>If we are going to describe, evaluate and discuss testing
methods for accessibility, we need to have consistent categorization of the
various function barriers. We therefor consider function barrier categories
from a testing point of view, and not from a medical point of view. We also
focus on testing digital solutions and not physical environments, and this will
also impact on our categorization. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The categorization of WHO is very broad and complex and can
cover a large range of applications. However, their main focus is a medical
perspective, and they do not have a good classification scheme for ICT
interactions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Another interesting categorization is based on the 1996/97
Disability Follow-up Survey in Great Britain [23]. This categorization is most
relevant for product design. It is developed to support estimating the number
of people who are excluded from particular aspects of product use, and to help
product designers making informed design decisions. The categories are vision,
hearing, cognition, mobility, dexterity and reach.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>It is worth noting that there are separate categories for
mobility, dexterity and reach. Mobility covers walking, steps and balancing,
while dexterity is about grasping and finefinger manipulation, in both the
dominant and non-dominant hand. We believe that it is the latter that has the
highest relevance to software usage, and this is covered in the third W3C
category &quot;Physical&quot;.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Our goal is to find the most common and non-overlapping
categorization of function barriers that users experience when using ICT
solutions, and we believe that the W3C categorization is the more useful from a
software perspective. However, their second category that includes cognitive,
learning and neurological barriers can be expanded since it's a very large and
complex group as defined by W3C. Researchers have pointed out that W3C WCAG 1.0
and 2.0 have limitations when it comes to addressing cognitive disabilities
[24]. W3C acknowledges that this is still a challenge in the newly published
WCAG 2.1 [25], by stating that it makes &quot;some accommodation for learning
disabilities and cognitive limitations&quot;. Also, it could be argued that
software in general puts high demands on the cognitive abilities of the user
because it usually contains a lot of information.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Another argument for expanding the cognitive or Learning
Disability category is because it is a large number of people that experience
cognitive functional barriers, and it make sense to break the group into
smaller sizes. It is difficult to find accurate number on how many people that
experience the different functional barriers, but several studies indicate that
cognitive disabilities are more common than the other types of disabilities,
such as vision and hearing. Statistics from the US [26] for 2016 explains that
while 2.4\% of the population have some vision disabilities and 3.5\% of the
population have hearing disabilities, a whole 4.8\% of the population have some
form of cognitive disability. This does not, of course, directly relate to
functional barriers for ICT solutions, but it gives a strong indication that
the cognitive category should be broken down into smaller categories. A final
argument for breaking down the cognition category, is that ICT solutions places
very high and particular demands on the cognitive functions because it is very
information intensive.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>We have therefore expanded the W3C categories with some of
the mental functions from ICF that are relevant from the perspective of testing
of ICT barriers. This includes attention and memory functions which are merged
into one category, thought and higherlevel cognitive functions which are merged
into one category, and finally language and calculation which are also merged
into one category. Finally we end up with three cognitive categories instead of
one as shown in Table 1: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The merging of functions into categories are based on
similarities of barriers that are created. For example a page that requires
five successive, correct, operations creates barriers because it requires
attention that can last for all five operations <i>and</i> a memory of several
earlier operations. Hence, attention and memory is grouped in one category. </p>

in  software  development; ranging from fully automated tools to manual

grouping these methods, but no clear standard from a software development
perspective. In terms of software development, how much time it takes to
conduct a test is vital since accessibility testing is often neglected because
of constrained resources [28]. We have therefore categorized methods based on their
cost in terms of how long they take to complete on average and how different
they are. The different method types are listed in Table 2. There are studies
that have tried to categorize cost [16], and we have based our work on a
similar definition with low, medium, high. Low typically means that a testing
method can test a single webpage in less than 5 minutes, while medium between 5
and 30 minutes depending on how well the tester knows the method. High means
more than 30 minutes for a single webpage. </p>

margin-left:-.75pt'>We have evaluated four typical accessibility testing tools
for each method type, and an overview can be seen in Table 3. The evaluation of
coverage was performed based on the description of barriers in each category.
For example, for the category <i>L&amp;N</i> a method that includes checks of
accessibility in textual and/or numerical content received an x.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Many of the automatic checkers had only one rule or test
that within the attention and memory (<i>A&amp;M</i>) barrier category.
However, it was at most one single test, and we believe it would be
unreasonable to make a check for the <i>A&amp;M</i> category based on a single
test. Each automatic tool has a set of rules, or algorithms that tests single
accessibility aspects. A tool was deemed to include a check for a category if
rules covering barriers from that category is present in the tools rule set.
Only rules that specifically identifies an error were included. For example in
the case of HTMLCodeSniffer, the rule with the description &quot;Ensure that
the image submit button's alt text identifies the purpose of the button&quot;
was excluded because it is a <i>possible</i> error, but the tools does not test
the content of the alt text. On the other hand, a rule with the description
&quot;Image submit button missing an alt attribute&quot; was included because
it tests whether the alt attribute is present. HTMLCodeSniffer received and x
in the <i>Vis</i> column in Table 3 because there were several rules checking
the accessibility of visual content. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The checklists were deemed to include a check if one of the
checkpoints in the list covered barriers from the category. For example, a
checklist containing checks of auditory content received an x in the <i>Aud</i>
column of the table. Simulation tools were evaluated based on the kinds of
barrier it simulated, for example a tool simulating dyslexia received an x in
the <i>L&amp;N</i> column. Expert testing methods assumes that the expert
designing the test is aware of barriers from all categories and includes them
in the test design. </p>

are covered varies quite a lot between the different method types. This is
expected, since the time and resources required to use the different method
types also varies a lot, and also because some of the methods have a focus on
particular functions, such as vision in the case of Cambridge Simulation
glasses. </p>

margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>Our categorization of function barriers
allows us to investigate which barriers that accessibility testing methods
cover. We have shown that it is practical to expand the W3C groups into several
cognitive barriers, since this makes it clear that many barriers are
inadequately covered by testing methods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>We have marked some of the testing methods with a check for
attention and memory <i>A&amp;M</i>, but very few have tests or guidelines for
memory. In most cases it is the tests for attention that gave a check for this
barrier category. This might indicate that we should have memory as a separate
barrier category. In the US alone, an estimated 5.4 million have mild cognitive
impairments (MCI) not counting dementia [29]. A typical barrier for people with
MCI is loss of short-term memory, which support the indication that memory
barriers is experienced by many people. Complicated webshops and checkout processes
are obvious candidates where testing methods needs to check for memory issues.
There were also very few methods that have any tests for barriers in
understanding and handling numbers in the <i>L&amp;N</i> category, and more
tests for number barriers should be developed and implemented. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Also more testing methods for higher level logic (<i>HLL</i>)
barriers and speech (<i>Spe</i>) is required, since very few methods consider
that category. This is important since complex pages like webshops and
information webpages often make use of higher level logic. Government webpages
that explains what kind of tax reduction you are entitled to is a typical
example.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Visual (<i>Vis</i>) and physical (<i>Phy</i>) barriers are
the categories that are best covered by all testing methods. Ideally all
testing methods should cover all barriers, but this is not required as long as
the testers make sure to select a group of methods that covers as many barriers
as possible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>The methods of the expert type (<i>Exp</i>) are the only
testing methods that show very good coverage for all barriers. However, that
comes with a cost since they require extensive training and takes longer to
conduct that the other method types [30]. This does not mean that they should
not be used of course, but we believe it is likely that they will not be
selected by software teams with limited time and resources. At best they are
maybe used once throughout the project, and probably towards the end before
user testing. It also takes time to master these expert methods, as Brajnik
have shown that noneexperiences do not achieve the same quality level as
experienced experts [13]. This means that other method types needs to improve
their coverage of barriers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:27.5pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Previously it has been recommended that when software teams
are testing for accessibility they should make sure to include at least three
different testing methods [1], and make sure to include methods that are
supplementing each other in terms of barriers they are covering. Table 3
clearly illustrates the need for combining various methods in order to cover as
many barriers as possible. While the testers should also have the cost of
utilizing the various methods in mind, the table can be an aid when deciding
upon the best combination of methods. The cheaper methods may be conducted more
often than the expensive. However, the testers must then be aware of which
barriers they are actually testing for. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>We have not verified that the accessibility
testing methods actually cover the barriers that they claim to test for. With
other words, we are trusting the documentation for each of the methods. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:27.6pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Also, the category &quot;Cost&quot; for method types is set
only from an experience point of view, with further influences from other

</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:0in'>In this work, we have discussed how
barriers can be categorized based on existing classifications.  We argue for
splitting the cognition category into several smaller categories, since this is
a large and diverse group. From a testing point of view, it can be beneficial
to subdivide the cognitive group into categories that can be tested by
different testing methods. The same approach could also be applied to the other
barriers, but we have focused on the cognitive barrier in this paper, since
this category seems to be weakly covered in the literature. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>We have further compared numerous accessibility testing
methods for software development. The methods have been categorized into five
method types. For each method type we have evaluated four testing methods and
shown what barriers they cover. An analysis of some of the most common
accessibility testing methods, and to what extent they cover the various
barrier categories, has also been presented. The matrix showing the functional
barrier categories and testing methods gives a quick overview of which testing
method to choose from for a particular barrier. Our goal is that this overview
of accessibility testing methods can be used by software development teams when
they need to decide what kind of method they should use. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>Our work further indicate that software teams should
prioritize to educate and train several members of the team in different expert
methods, since these are the only methods that cover all barriers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.3pt;margin-bottom:23.75pt;
margin-left:-.75pt'>More studies into other testing methods should be done to
provide a better overview of accessibility testing methods and which barriers
they cover. It is also quite clear that more testing methods are needed for the
cognition domain, and in particular for barriers related to memory, numbers,
and higher-level logic. They should be developed and implemented for several
types of methods, such as checklists and walkthroughs. Finally, more attention
should be given to how to categorize barriers within the cognition domain. We
believe it not beneficial to group all cognitive barriers together in one group
and have shown some of the consequences in this paper by illustrating the lack
of tests for cognitive barriers. </p>
