Assistive Technology Devices for Students Struggling in Mathematics

 

This document contains information on the range of assistive technology supports that can be used by students who are struggling in mathematics.  Supports are available to aid in basic calculations through higher level math skills.  Supports are also available to help students who are experiencing difficulty in math due to writing and/or reading difficulties.  The types of assistive technology supports used are determined by individual student abilities and needs as well as the required mathematical tasks across all instructional environments.  

 

In this document, assistive technology supports are organized into various categories based on the primary features or applications of the technology.  Moreover, the age ranges for which the supports are appropriate are identified in the following categories:  elementary, middle, and high school.  Lastly, tools are linked to the various math skills addressed in the Georgia Performance Standards.  It is recommended that individuals utilizing this document refer to the standards to determine the specific skills that are addressed at each grade level.

 

§   Number and Number Relations

§   Measurement

§   Geometry

§   Algebra

§   Data Analysis and Probability

 

The assistive technology supports referenced in this document are included to provide examples of different types of aids used by students with disabilities to accomplish educationally relevant tasks in instructional and access areas.  The document does not include all assistive technology supports within a given category and inclusion of a particular support does not constitute endorsement by the Georgia Department of Education.  Additional supports may be added to the document by contacting the Georgia Project for Assistive Technology.
