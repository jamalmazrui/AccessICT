A Guide to Accessible Event Planning

[]

What is this guide?

This guide has the instructions to set up accessible events and conferences. Accessible means people can fully participate in conferences. Accessible event planning includes four steps. These four steps are universal design, physical accessibility, sensory accessibility, and cognitive accessibility.

Here is what each of these steps means:

Universal Design 

•        Universal design means everyone can go and take part at an event. Physical accessibility, sensory accessibility, and cognitive accessibility must happen for everyone to take part.

•        Physical Accessibility: The space has no problems for wheelchair users and people with vision disabilities

•        Sensory Accessibility: The event is safe for people with allergies. There are accommodations for people who are Blind, Deaf, or hard of hearing.

•        Cognitive Accessibility: Give clear information about the event. Provide all material in different formats and plain language. Let people know what to expect in advance.

•        Accept and deal with accessibility needs that are different from yours.

This guide includes an accessibility checklist and a sample accommodations form.

Physical Accessibility

All physical space used for the conference can be used by everybody. This includes hotels, elevators, and conference room. Examples of physical accessibility include:

 

Doors/Entrances

•        Signs with braille that say the names of buildings, room numbers, and where accessible entrances and elevators are

•        Main entrances have wheelchair accessible ramps

•        Working entrance buttons for wheelchair users

•        Wide doors and hallways for wheelchair users

•        Clear paths in and around your venue for blind people and wheelchair users

•        Accessible elevators that work

Surrounding Areas

•        []No hills around your conference buildings and transportation

•        Check for curb ramps that accommodate both wheelchair users and people with vision disabilities (see image at right)

•        Restaurants nearby  (no more than 5 minutes walking distance)

•        Weather: depending on your location, snow and ice during winter can prevent participants from attending your event. Try to schedule your events in the spring, summer, or early fall.

Seating

•        Wheelchair accessible activity tables with room for snacks, medications, and session materials

•        Chairs with high backs for people with balance issues

•        Everyone can see the front of the room

•        Accessible seating should be part of the room set up

•        Do not separate accessible seating from the group

•        Wheelchair accessible public bathrooms should be next to or near training session rooms

Transportation

•        Accessible transportation near the location (no more than five minutes walking)

•        Have a list of accessible transportation options

•        Bus

•        Taxis

•        Subway

•        Local non-emergency cabulance companies (businesses that offer wheelchair accessible transportation)

Overnight Lodging for Conferences

•        Rooms with ADA automatic door opener

•        Rooms with enough space for wheelchair users to move around comfortably

•        Bathrooms have roll-in showers with a bench

•        The beds are high enough for a hoyer lift but low enough for wheelchair users

Sensory Accessibility

There are two types of sensory accessibility:

1.     Hearing and visual aids are available (sometimes overlaps with cognitive accessibility)

2.     A safe place for people with chemical and light allergies and/or sensitivities.

Examples of hearing, visual, and tactile (sense of touch) accommodations

•        Image descriptions for presentations and captioning for videos

•        Sound devices for hard-of-hearing attendees

•        Microphones

•        CART and ASL interpretation

•        Alternative formats: braille, digital, easy read (plain language with pictures), large print

Examples of accommodations for chemical and light sensitivities

•        Fragrance free policies

•        No flash photography policies

•        ASL applause (or “flapplause”) instead of clapping

•        Noise cancelling ear muffs

•        Sensory free rooms

•        Working air conditioning

Cognitive Accessibility

Everyone who comes to the event knows what to expect. Everyone knows: 1) What the event is about. 2) The schedule. 3) Where the event is. 4) What accommodations are available.

Examples of cognitive accessibility include: 

Detailed Schedules

•        Make a schedule for your event available on your website or in emails.

•        Send schedules to people in advance of your event.

•        Conferences: send schedules that include airport arrival and departure times, training session names, speaker names, and breaks to participants and speakers at least a month in advance of your event. People who do not use email receive hard copy schedules.

•        One-day events: send a completed schedule/agenda no later than 2 weeks in advance. 

Information Packets (for Overnight Conferences)

•        Accommodations form with a list of accommodations people can request

•        Include two types of event schedules: An event schedule and daily schedules (see appendix for example)

•        Include information about quiet spaces

•        Provide the name, email, and phone number of main contact person for the event

•        Provide a list of local medical equipment stores with rental fees 

(for commodes, hoyer lifts, and other types of equipment event organizers cannot reserve)

•        Add a brief note about expectations for support people

•        Note: information packets should be sent to confirmed participants 3 to 4 months before your conference.

Cognitive Accessibility at the Venue

•        Use nametags for everyone.

•        Present sessions in different ways.(i.e. written and verbal instructions, visual aids such as photographs, drawings, and charts)

•        Schedule many breaks throughout the day. Do not schedule sessions that go beyond an hour and a half.

•        Allow people to move around to stim or pace.

•        Provide and explain color communication badges.

•        Make sure presentations are viewable from different angles.

Conflicting Access Needs

An access need is a support or accommodation a person needs to communicate,

learn, and participate fully in an activity. People need different things to participate. Sometimes the needs of two different people conflict. Below are two situations and how to solve them.

Scenario # 1:  People with low vision need fluorescent lighting. However, people with sensory disabilities have headaches and become anxious with fluorescent lighting.

Possible Solutions:

•        Provide high contrast electronic and hard-copy presentation materials for low vision participants in advance

•        Allow participants with low vision to bring a personal lamp for tasks

•        Use natural ligh when possible

•        Bring light filters if natural lighting is not an option

 

Scenario #2:  A person cannot process speech well. He needs to hear things multiple times to understand them. Another person has a physical disability. She cannot speak well.

Possible Solutions:

•        Allow the use of tape recorders for the event so people can hear information many times.

•        Allow text-to-speech devices.

•        A person with a communication disability may ask a support person’s help.

The support person repeats what they said to the group.
