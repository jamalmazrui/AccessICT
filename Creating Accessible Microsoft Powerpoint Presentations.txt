Data Tables 
Accessible tables need a clear table structure and table headers to help guide a screen reader user. 
• Select the Insert tab on the ribbon, then select Table > Insert Table. 
• Keep tables simple. Tere is no way to add table header information in a way that will be identifed by a screen reader. 
• If you have Adobe Acrobat Pro (not just the free Reader), save your presentation to PDF and add table headers in Acrobat Pro. 
Hyperlinks 
PowerPoint automatically creates a hyperlink when a user pastes a full URL onto a slide and presses Enter or Space. Tese may not make sense to screen reader users or others, so make the link text descriptive.

Other Principles 
• Ensure font size is sufcient. If your presentation will be viewed on a projector, font size may need to be even larger. 
• Provide sufcient contrast. If your presentation will be viewed on a projector, sometimes the contrast needs to be even more pronounced. 
• Do not use color as the only way to convey meaning. 
• Avoid automatic slide transitions. 
• Use simple slide transitions when possible. 
• Do not put accessibility information like alternative text in the Notes pane. 
• If you have embedded video, ensure it is captioned. 
• If you have embedded audio, include a transcript. 
• If your slides contain animations, ensure they are brief and do not distract from the most important content on the page. 
• Use simple language.
