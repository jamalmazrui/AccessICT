1     Introduction

Digital accessibility is integral to modern times, especially because a significant percentage of the population is with one or multiple disabilities today. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 16% of the global population (or ∼1.3 billion people) currently suffers from significant disability (World Health Organization, 2022). This statistic highlights the need for digital content and services to be accessible to people with disabilities so that they are not excluded from actively participating the digital society today (Dobransky and Hargittai, 2016). Consequently, digital accessibility is not only a social responsibility, but also essential for legal compliance, inclusion, and business benefits. It ensures that everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, has equal access to digital content and services, and is an essential factor of an organization that provides digital content or services. Digital accessibility, as defined by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI),

01

implies that people with disabilities should be able to access, navigate, perceive, and interact with content [Initiative (WAI), 2022]. Digital accessibility refers to the practice of designing digital systems and services in a manner that makes them accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities (Sharma et al., 2020). This includes ensuring that websites, software, and other digital products can be used by people with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. Therefore, it is important to ensure that everyone, regardless of their ability, can access and use digital products without facing barriers or discrimination. If this is not done, it may result in people with disabilities being excluded from opportunities, diminishing their degree of independence.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capacity of a machine or computer system to simulate and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as logical reasoning, learning, and problem resolution (Hassani et al., 2020). The determination of when applications and services can be classified as intelligent, as opposed to merely emulating intelligent behavior, is a topic of debate (Schank, 1991). Notwithstanding the ongoing philosophical discourse surrounding the extent and limitations of AI, remarkable progress has been made in a vast array of disciplines, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. For example, AI-powered voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, and Google Assistant have become increasingly popular because of their ability to interpret natural language and offer user-friendly responses (McLean et al., 2021). In addition, AI pattern recognition algorithms have proven beneficial in several applications, including facial recognition, image processing, and object detection (Abiodun et al., 2019; Fu, 2019; Liu et al., 2020). AI has benefited industries by monitoring and detecting defects in various processes, resulting in increased productivity and decreased downtime (Pimenov et al., 2023). AI has also been instrumental in forecasting using intricate data analysis to make predictions. AI has been beneficial for improving treatment processes in the healthcare industry. For instance, tools powered by AI have been used to analyze medical images and identify abnormalities, resulting in more precise diagnosis and treatment recommendations (Liu et al., 2006). Smart assistive technologies, such as wheelchairs designed for people with limited mobility (Leaman and La, 2017) and canes intended for people with visual impairments (Hapsari et al., 2017), leverage advancements in AI to offer enhanced products and services. These advancements demonstrate the immense potential of AI in improving accessibility and user experience, making it an intriguing field of study for both researchers and practitioners.

The importance of digital accessibility in the AI era cannot be overstated. With the increasing use of AI in all spheres of life, it is crucial to ensure that these technologies are accessible to all individuals. This review presents the current state of the application of AI in the digital accessibility sector and proposes a classification system for identifying accessibility standards and frameworks, challenges, AI methodologies, and functionalities of AI in digital accessibility.

The next section provides background information on AI and its applications in various industries. Subsequently, an overview of current applications of AI in the digital accessibility sector is provided. This is followed by the research methodology, which describes the process of systematic review mapping and presents research results based on a classification framework. Subsequently, we discuss the current literature on the four dimensions of accessibility frameworks/standards, challenges, methodologies, and applications of AI for digital accessibility. Finally, future research directions and implications are discussed.

2     Background

As artificial intelligence continues to permeate various aspects of our lives, it is important to investigate its impact on the digital accessibility of people with disabilities. The inception of the term “Artificial Intelligence” or “AI” dates back to the 1950’s when it emerged as a concept for designing machines with the ability to perform tasks that resemble human-like cognitive abilities (Schwendicke et al., 2020). In recent years, AI has made significant advancements in various industries including healthcare, finance, and transportation. With the development of machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning algorithms, machines can now learn from data and improve their performances over time. This has the potential to significantly improve accessibility for people with disabilities, particularly in the health care industry. For example, AI is already being used to analyze medical images and diagnose diseases, such as cancer (Bi et al., 2019). In the finance industry, AI can also be used for tasks such as fraud detection and credit scoring (Zhou et al., 2018), which could potentially affect the financial accessibility of people with disabilities. However, it is important to monitor the use of AI in finance to ensure that it does not perpetuate discrimination against people with disabilities or other marginalized groups. Overall, although AI has the potential to improve accessibility and inclusion, it is important to approach its development and implementation with caution and focus on inclusivity.

Rapid advancements in technology have led to an increase in the use of digital devices for various purposes, including access to healthcare services. However, not everyone has equal access to these digital resources because of various barriers, such as physical, sensory, and cognitive disabilities. AI-powered technologies such as Automated Speech Recognition (ASR), Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT), Google Vision API, and DeepMind are increasingly being used to improve accessibility for people with disabilities (Bragg et al., 2019). These technologies have the potential to transform interactions with digital devices and platforms. For example, ASR can provide captions and subtitles for video content (Alonzo et al., 2022), and image and facial recognition technologies can assist people with visual impairments (Feng et al., 2020). The utilization of AI-generated summaries in digital content can provide an advantage for screen reader users by breaking down lengthy texts into more manageable portions (Chen et al., 2023). Furthermore, AI can simulate user behavior to pinpoint and rectify navigation issues, and automate regression testing. Additionally, the implementation of AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can offer accessible communication options for people with speech and hearing impairments (Shezi and Ade-Ibijola, 2020; Subashini and Krishnaveni, 2021). However, the potential risks associated with AI in this context must be considered, such as the possibility of perpetuating existing biases

and neglecting the needs and experiences of certain groups of people with disabilities. It is crucial to address these potential drawbacks to ensure that these technologies are truly inclusive and provide benefits for all users.

Machine learning algorithms can recognize patterns and identify accessibility barriers to digital content (Abduljabbar et al., 2019). For example, image recognition algorithms can automatically provide alternative text descriptions for images, making them accessible to the visually impaired (Bigham et al., 2006). Similarly, natural language processing algorithms can identify and correct language that may be difficult for people with cognitive impairments to understand (Le Glaz et al., 2021). By creating machine-learning algorithms that specifically address the issues of digital accessibility, we can create technology that benefits all users, regardless of their abilities. However, it is crucial that these algorithms are developed with inputs from people with disabilities to ensure that they are effective and meet their needs. In addition, it is important to consider the potential biases present in the data used to train these algorithms, as they may perpetuate existing inequalities and exclusion. By addressing these issues and prioritizing accessibility in machine-learning algorithms, we can work toward a more inclusive and equitable digital future for all.

Advancements in AI have created new opportunities to enhance digital accessibility for people with disabilities (Hapsari et al., 2017). However, as AI technology progresses, it is crucial to closely examine its impact on accessibility and to ensure that these technologies are developed in an equitable and inclusive manner. Despite the growing interest in the intersection of AI and digital accessibility, a comprehensive systematic review of the current state of knowledge and practices in this field is yet to be conducted. This systematic review aimed to fill this research gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of the current state of knowledge and practices related to AI and digital accessibility. By reviewing the existing literature, this study offers valuable insights into the potential benefits of AI for people with disabilities as well as identifying potential challenges and opportunities. Furthermore, this review can guide future research and development activities toward creating more inclusive and accessible technologies. The results of this systematic review can provide valuable resources for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers working in the fields of digital accessibility and AI by identifying gaps in current knowledge and practices, which can help promote digital accessibility and support the development of inclusive technologies that benefit everyone.

3     Materials and methods

This literature review followed the procedures and processes for conducting literature searches proposed by Watson (2015), and was conducted in three phases: planning, execution, and reporting. The systematic review methodology used in this study incorporated the strategies and guidelines outlined by Kitchenham et al. (2007) and Ali et al. (2018, 2020, 2021, 2023). Figure 1 depicts the steps involved in the systematic review.

In the planning phase, the need for a systematic review was identified, a classification framework was defined, research questions were defined, and a research protocol was developed.

During the execution phase, the search query was conducted based on the following keywords: exclusion and inclusion criteria were applied; screening based on title and abstract reading, full-text reading, and quality assessment were conducted. The reporting phase included classification of the chosen articles and discussion of the findings.

3.1     Planning stage

3.1.1     Identify the need for a systematic review

To our knowledge, no systematic review has comprehensively outlined these research findings, while providing a profound analysis of the research and practice related to the topic of digital accessibility, with a specific focus on AI applications for people with disabilities. Although limited in number, existing surveys on digital accessibility are often specialized in nature, with many being country-specific studies or tailored to specific fields, such as education and software engineering processes (Bong and Chen, 2021; Chadli et al., 2021; Paiva et al., 2021; Prado et al., 2023). However, despite these valuable efforts, no comprehensive systematic review has yet extensively examined the intersection of digital accessibility and AI applications within the existing literature. This study seeks to address this gap by providing an extensive analysis of this field, revealing potential benefits, challenges, and opportunities.

3.1.2     Develop a research review protocol

In this step, the research review protocol used for the literature review was finalized. The classification framework is based on a model initially developed by Ngai and Wat (2002), which is based on how advanced technologies have enhanced various fields. The framework was developed and modified by Ali et al. (2018, 2020, 2021, 2023). The framework used in our study takes into consideration four dimensions of how AI is used in different sectors about accessibility: applications, AI methodology and techniques, design standards and frameworks used, and challenges. Table 1 provides more details on the classification framework used in our study.

3.1.3     Defining the research questions

Formulating the research questions for this study is a crucial step in systematic reviews (Paul et al., 2021). The research questions identified for the study are as follows:

RQ 1. What are the AI applications that have been used to enhance digital accessibility?

RQ 2. What are the different AI techniques that have been used to enhance the accessibility of digital systems for people with disabilities?

RQ 3. What are the key challenges and barriers that must be overcome to achieve accessible AI systems for people with disabilities ?

To minimize bias, strategies for article selection were determined at this stage. As a part of this process, a comprehensive search strategy was created to encompass a wide-ranging search of various databases, and a manual review of the selected articles was conducted. The databases chosen for this systematic review included the ACM Digital Library, IEEEXplore, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Springer. During the research process, filtering tools were employed for every database to minimize duplication. In conducting the manual review, the broad manual review method was utilized, which entailed scanning the title and abstract of each research article (Golder et al., 2014), followed by reading the full content of the selected articles to eliminate any irrelevant ones. Table 2 lists the eligibility criteria used in this study.

3.2     Execution stage

The execution stage involved the implementation of the steps outlined in the planning phase. The main steps undertaken in the execution stage are as follows:

•    To ensure a thorough search, we utilized key terms extracted from relevant research papers and research questions,

04

including synonyms, acronyms, and spelling variations of these terms. The search terms were then classified into three categories: those related to AI, technology-specific terms, and accessibility in the context of disability. The keywords identified for this study were: ((“Artificial Intelligence” OR “AI”) AND (“Digital” OR “technology” OR “technologies” OR “technological”) AND (“accessibility” OR “inclusion” OR “inclusivity” OR “disability” OR “disabled” OR “special needs” OR “impaired” OR “impairment”)).

•    Filtering tools were used to refine the research results while conducting the online database search. Several filters were implemented in this study, including the year of publication (2018–2023), document type (journal articles and conference papers), and language (English). Given the vast quantity of results, additional filters, such as “title,” “abstract,” and “keyword” search, as well as “open access” filters, were utilized to refine the search. Of the 50,655 search results returned by the Springer database, only the first 1,000 were considered for this review.

•    The articles were subjected to abstract and keyword screening followed by full-text screening.

•    To ensure the validity of the articles included in this study, certain quality assessment criteria were applied to confirm their value. Quality assessment of the candidate papers followed the guidelines outlined in Kitchenham et al. (2007) study. Consequently, we formulated the following questions to evaluate quality.

1.   Are the aims clearly stated?

2.   Are data collection methods adequately described?

3.   Are all of the study questions answered?

4.  

  -- ----
     
     []
  -- ----

Is the AI technique and methodology used in this studyfully defined?

5.   How do these results add to the literature?

6.   Are the limitations of this study were adequately addressed.

7.   How clear and coherent are reports?

Each QA inquiry was evaluated using a three-point rating system. A response of “yes” received a score of 1, a “partial” response earned 0.5 points, and a “no” response was assigned a score of 0. If the study effectively addressed the QA question, it received a full point, whereas a partial response warranted 0.5 points. Any paper that failed to address the QA question was assigned a score of 0. The quality of the research articles was assessed using the QA questions to determine the overall quality score for each study. An inclusion criterion was established, requiring a minimum overall score of four for research inclusion. Studies with scores below four were excluded.

3.3     Summarizing stage

Data collection for this review was conducted between May 18, 2023, and May 24, 2023. Figure 2 shows the final number of articles selected for this review. The search results based on the keywords and search filters applied identified 3,706 articles. Duplicates and retracted articles were removed prior to the abstract, title, and keyword screening. In total, 2,424 articles were removed at this stage. During the full-text screening stage, 850 articles were excluded, leaving 280 articles. These articles were

05

subjected to quality assessment, and 42 articles were retained for the final analysis.

4     Results and discussion

4.1              Distribution of article by publication year

Figure 3 illustrates the dissemination of articles by the year of publication. The first publication on the utilization of AI in accessibility was published in 2018, whereas the most substantial number of articles (13) were released in 2022. Conversely, only one article was published in 2018.

4.2     [] Distribution of articles by database

Figure 4 depicts the distribution of the selected articles by the database source. A total of 41 articles were identified in Scopus, followed by one article each from ScienceDirect and ACM Digital databases. No articles were selected from IEEEXplore or Springer database, as they were either duplicates or had to be excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria during the screening process.

4.3     Research classification framework

The findings of the review were the result of a comprehensive analysis of articles related to AI and digital accessibility that

were presented and evaluated. The classification framework was applied by considering four dimensions: accessibility guidelines, frameworks, standards, challenges, methodologies, and applications. Additional information is provided in Tables 3–6.

4.3.1     (RQ 1) Dimension: disability types

4.3.1.1     AI for the visually impaired

The reviewed literature emphasizes the development of various applications aimed at enhancing the mobility, safety, and quality of life of the visually impaired. These applications include an array of functionalities such as obstacle detection, navigation, educational support, and social media accessibility.

Several systems have been specifically designed for obstacle detection and spatial information. For example, Balakrishnan et al. (2023) presented a novel synchronization protocol for vision sensors that provides real-time obstacle detection and spatial detail to improve mobility and safety. Building upon this, Royal et al. (2023) went a step further by not only detecting objects but also offering real-time object recognition and text reading within images, thereby improving overall accessibility.

In the domain of safety, Abdusalomov et al. (2022) utilized AI-based fire detection and classification methods to monitor and forecast fire-related scenarios, thereby providing early warnings that are specifically tailored to the needs of blind and visually impaired individuals. Akter et al. (2022) examined shared ethical and privacy considerations relevant to people with visual impairments, making a significant contribution to the ethical development of assistive technologies.

The AviPer system utilizes a visual-tactile multimodal attention network that incorporates a self-developed flexible tactile glove and webcam (Li et al., 2022). This novel approach enables visually impaired individuals to perceive and interact with their surroundings. Furthermore, Chaitra et al. (2022) presented a viable and cost-effective solution for visualizing environments using handheld devices, such as mobile phones.

In urban environments, Montanha et al. (2022) employed context awareness and AI methods to aid visually impaired pedestrians in safely navigating roadways and generating real-time instructions based on traffic conditions.

Duarte et al. (2021) worked to enhance the accessibility of social media content, particularly benefiting people with visual impairments. In addition, Thomas and Meehan (2021) introduced a mobile banknote recognition application and Wadhwa et al. (2021) improved environmental understanding by offering braillereadable captions for digital images.

Lo Valvo et al. (2021) concentrated on the development of indoor and outdoor localization and navigation technologies for visually impaired individuals. Harum et al. (2021) presented a multi-language interactive device that enables the reading and translation of text from various printed materials. Karyono et al. (2020) addressed the issue of lighting discomfort experienced by the visually impaired and elderly, by introducing a specially designed system.

Kose and Vasant (2020) offered effective walking-path support to university students with visual impairments, enhancing their overall campus experience. Joshi et al. (2020) introduced an AIbased fully automated assistive system with real-time perception, obstacle-aware navigation, and auditory feedback. The AI-Vision smart glasses, outlined in Alashkar et al. (2020), utilize machine learning algorithms for facial expression/age/gender recognition and color recognition, providing assistance in daily tasks. Furthermore, See and Advincula (2021) automated the production of tactile educational materials, such as tactile flashcards, tactile maps, and tactile peg puzzles, which incorporate interactive tactile graphics and braille captions, serving as a versatile tool for teaching concepts such as shapes and geography to visually impaired and blind students.

Lucibello and Rotondi (2019), Saha et al. (2019), and Watters et al. (2020) aimed to improve the lives of both blind and visually impaired individuals. Lucibello and Rotondi (2019) focused on supporting blind athletes in the track and field, promoting independent running, and enhancing spatial awareness through the learning of echolocation skills. Saha et al. (2019) has created a system that provides near-real-time information about the surroundings through a smartphone camera, enhancing the mobility skills of people with visual impairments. Finally, Watters et al. (2020) aimed to provide visually impaired students with a virtual assistant in the laboratory that could be controlled through natural language, eliminating the need for specific keywords or phrases.

4.3.1.2     AI for speech and hearing impairment

This section explores innovative technologies developed to cater to people with speech and hearing impairments. These technologies have been categorized into distinct applications that offer a range of benefits. For instance, a graphene-based wearable artificial throat was developed to provide highly accurate speech recognition and voice reproduction capabilities, particularly for those who have undergone laryngectomy (Yang et al., 2023).

Additionally, a platform that recognizes complex sign language was designed to offer an effective means of communication for speechimpaired children (Ullah et al., 2023). The automatic recognition of two-handed signs in Indian Sign Language also serves as a teaching assistant, enhancing cognitive abilities and fostering interest in learning for hearing and speech-impaired children (Sreemathy et al., 2022). The real-time interpretation and recognition of American Sign Language contributes to seamless control of smart home components, addressing the specific needs of people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing in their interactions with smart home devices (Rajasekhar and Panday, 2022).

4.3.1.4     AI for neurological disorder

Zingoni et al. (2021) aimed to enhance accessibility and inclusion for dyslexic students by creating a supportive platform that utilizes best practices for educators and institutions to predict the most suitable methodologies and digital tools for students with the goal of addressing the challenges they face in their academic journeys.

4.3.1.5     AI for motor impaired

Cimolino et al. (2021) aimed to tackle the issue of inaccessibility in gaming for people with disabilities, particularly those with spinal cord injuries, by proposing a novel method called “partial automation” that enables an AI partner to manage inaccessible game inputs to improve overall accessibility in gaming.

4.3.1.6     AI for other disabilities

This section encompasses an array of innovative applications that cater to people with other disabilities. Campomanes-Alvarez and Rosario Campomanes-Alvarez (2021) focused on individuals with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities, devising the INSENSION platform to recognize facial expressions, thereby enabling interaction with digital applications and enhancing their quality of life. Second, Ingavelez-Guerra et al. (2022) implemented a multilevel methodological approach to automatically adapt open educational resources within e-learning environments, considering the diverse needs and preferences of students with various disabilities, including hearing impairments, physical disabilities, intellectual and developmental disabilities, visual impairments, and mental health issues. Third, Guo et al. (2021) presented a virtual human social system that empowered individuals with facial disabilities, deafmutes, and autism to engage in face-to-face video communication. Additionally, Hezam et al. (2023) utilized a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making method to prioritize digital technologies for enhancing transportation accessibility for people with disabilities, addressing barriers, and selecting technologies through an uncertain decision-making framework. Furthermore, Lu et al. (2020) aimed to aid people with disabilities in operating tractors, ensuring safe operation when consciousness and limb movements are inconsistent, whereas Lin et al. (2019) focused on providing wheelchair-accessible bus rides for people with disabilities. The INSENSION Platform for Personalized Assistance of Non-symbolic Interaction for individuals with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD), developed by Kosiedowski et al. (2020), supports independence by recognizing non-symbolic behaviors and collecting contextual information through video, audio, and sensor data. Park et al. (2021) proposed an online infrastructure to enable large-scale remote data contributions from disability communities to create inclusive AI systems. These diverse applications underscore the importance of tailored technological solutions in promoting independence, accessibility, and improved quality of life for people with disabilities, emphasizing the need for an inclusive design and comprehensive consideration of user needs in the development of assistive technologies.

4.3.2     (RQ 2) Dimension: methodology

The accessibility of digital systems for people with disabilities can be enhanced by employing various AI techniques, which can be classified into several domains including Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Edge AI, and Computer Vision.

4.3.2.1     Computer vision

Several studies have demonstrated diverse applications of computer vision in enhancing accessibility. Balakrishnan et al. (2023) utilized object recognition for identifying and predicting object types, employing techniques such as object localization and detection. Jayawardena et al. (2019) used computer vision for object recognition and hand gesture/movement recognition in an educational context. In addition, Lo Valvo et al. (2021) employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for recognizing objects or buildings. Royal et al. (2023) developed a real-time object recognition and text extraction from images using deep learning algorithms in combination with the Pytesseract OCR Engine. Chaitra et al. (2022) employed a pre-trained Caffe Object Detection method to facilitate the text-to-signal processing feature summarizing the objects detected in the form of an audio catalog.

Abdusalomov et al. (2022) employed AI techniques such as fire, object, and text recognition, along with object mapping. Duarte et al. (2021) employed various AI methodologies including image recognition, text recognition in images, semantic similarity measures between text descriptions and image concepts, and language identification. Saha et al. (2019) utilized AI techniques, including object recognition, within the Landmark AI computer vision system, which employed a smartphone camera to offer realtime information and identify and describe landmarks and signs in the user’s surroundings.

4.3.2.2     Natural language processing (NLP)

NLP plays a critical role in making digital systems more accessible. Ingavelez-Guerra et al. (2022) transformed digital educational resources using NLP for automatic speech recognition (ASR) to extract textual information from videos. In addition, Wadhwa et al. (2021) utilized NLP to preprocess raw image and caption data, incorporating a pretrained CNN for image feature encoding and an LSTM-based RNN for generating natural language descriptions. Google’s speech-to-text recognition, which falls under NLP, was integrated to transcribe and process the spoken language into text for analysis (Zaid alahmadi and Alsulami, 2020).

4.4              Research implications, limitations, and future directions

Most research in the field of AI-driven digital accessibility has primarily focused on addressing the needs of people with visual impairment. This emphasis on AI solutions related to visual impairment is evident from the multitude of innovations and systems designed to enhance the lives of the visually impaired. These include a wide range of applications, from real-time obstacle detection and object recognition to tactile educational materials, and even AI-driven smart glasses. The impact of AI on digital accessibility for the visually impaired has been profound, leading to improved mobility, safety, and educational opportunities (Lo Valvo et al., 2021; See and Advincula, 2021; Abdusalomov et al., 2022). However, this concentration of visual impairments has highlighted a significant gap in the research landscape. There is a paucity of comprehensive AI systems tailored to address the unique challenges faced by people with other disabilities such as speech and hearing impairments, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), neurological disorders, and motor impairments. While there are some noteworthy AI solutions for these other disability types (Zingoni et al., 2021; Ullah et al., 2023), the sheer volume of research and innovation predominantly dedicated to visual impairment underscores the need for a more equitable distribution of research efforts. It is crucial to expand the scope of AI-driven digital accessibility to bridge this gap and provide people with various disabilities with the same level of support, independence, and accessibility that the visually impaired enjoy. This will require concerted effort to foster innovation and research in AI systems tailored to the specific needs of these communities. Our research highlights the urgent need for a fundamental shift in the design and development of systems catering to people with disabilities.

To address these shortcomings, the research agenda must prioritize a 2-fold approach. First, researchers must realign their efforts toward a more comprehensive examination of disabilities, ensuring that the unique challenges faced by people with diverse impairments are adequately considered. Second, it is imperative to augment data-collection efforts involving people with disabilities to capture a broader range of experiences and requirements. This inclusive approach not only enhances the inclusivity of technological solutions but also provides a more robust and informed foundation for future research and development in the field. A more focused effort is necessary to comprehend how the information requirements of people with disabilities can vary across different contexts, cultures, and audiences and how their needs are context-dependent (Akter et al., 2022). Future research should explore this aspect to enhance the AI-driven accessibility. Park et al. (2021) suggested that motivating people with disabilities for AI data collection should involve fair monetary compensation, nonmonetary incentives, and transparent communication regarding data use and privacy. To ensure accessibility, the data collection process should be streamlined and consider the diverse range of abilities within disability categories, avoid punitive measures, and acknowledge potential performance anxiety among people with disabilities. Future research should prioritize algorithmic accountability, transparency, and explainability in the development of assistive technologies (Akter et al., 2022). This approach ensures that users can better understand and trust the functioning of AIdriven systems, thereby contributing to their overall effectiveness and acceptance. Maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of the collected data is crucial, especially when the data are publicly available to promote large-scale machine learning advancements (Li et al., 2022). It is essential to extend the reach of the infrastructure to individuals beyond WEIRD societies, who may use different platforms, devices with lower specifications, or have limited access to broadband, and to support cultural adaptations in the data collection process (Li et al., 2022).

Although every effort has been made to ensure the comprehensiveness of the present research, it is possible that some significant studies may have been overlooked because of the vast number of results retrieved from one of the databases.

5     Conclusion

The significance of access to the Internet and digital content has intensified in recent times; however, not all individuals, particularly those with disabilities, have equitable access to this technology. By employing a thorough review and evaluation using a classification framework, this research specifically focuses on the impact of AI on digital accessibility in the context of disability. The most prevalent AI methodologies utilized are edge AI, NLP, Computer Vision, machine learning, and deep learning. The most common challenges encountered were related to data, technical difficulties, security and privacy concerns, and operational difficulties. The findings reveal a prevalent focus on AI-driven digital accessibility for people with visual impairments, indicating a substantial gap in addressing other disabilities. This research underscores the imperative need to realign efforts toward a more comprehensive examination of disabilities, urging researchers to broaden their scope and enhance data collection efforts involving people with various disabilities. The shortcomings of existing systems regarding adherence to accessibility standards highlight the pressing need for a fundamental shift in the design of solutions that prioritize the needs of people with disabilities. The study underscores the critical role of accessible AI in preventing exclusion and discrimination and emphasizes the urgency for a comprehensive approach to digital accessibility that accommodates diverse disability needs. As we move forward into the digital age, where Internet access is increasingly integral to education, entertainment, and communication, organizations are encouraged to prioritize and invest in digital accessibility. By adhering to established guidelines and standards, organizations can bridge the digital divide and ensure a fair and enjoyable online experience for all users regardless of their abilities. This not only promotes equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities, but also enhances overall usability and satisfaction for all users. Ultimately, this research calls for a concerted effort to make digital accessibility a cornerstone of our digital landscape, fostering an inclusive environment that benefits the entire user spectrum.
