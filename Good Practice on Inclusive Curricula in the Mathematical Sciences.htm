<h2>Background</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>Inclusive curriculum practice
refers to the process of developing, designing and refining programmes of
study to minimise the barriers that students may face in accessing the
curriculum (Higher Education Academy [1]). In addition to reacting to the needs
of individual students through reasonable adjustments, potential barriers
should be anticipated and resolved in a proactive manner. Both aspects are part
of the legal requirement [2]. A focus on the core requirements of the course
allows potential barriers to be identified, so that course delivery can be
redesigned to remove or reduce those barriers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>Courses with substantial
mathematical content pose specific accessibility challenges beyond those
usually considered in generic inclusive curricula good practice advice (see for
example the series of articles in MSOR Connections [3]). The Mathematics, Statistics
and OR (MSOR) Access Working and Interest Group (AccessMSOR WG) [3], of which
the author is Chair, brings together expertise and interest in issues
surrounding the support of disabled students in MSOR subjects. An AccessMSOR WG
workshop on inclusive curricula in MSOR took place with support from the
National HE STEM Programme in February 2011. Following this, group members and
workshop attendees were invited to submit case studies or reports relevant to
the theme.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:78.95pt'>The resultant guide, Good Practice on Inclusive
Curricula in the Mathematical Sciences, seeks to complement and extend, rather
than replace, generic good practice advice. In order to produce a practical
document, in addition to raising awareness of key questions, contributors were
asked to provide a context, identify potential barriers and give clear
recommendations.</p>

<h2>Potential barriers in MSOR</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>MSOR subjects are cumulative in
nature so concepts may take time to be fully assimilated and this has an impact
on teaching and assessment design. The Subject Benchmark Statement [4] notes
that seeing extended arguments developed in real-time is of benefit and this
underlies the continuing dominance in some contexts of traditional board-based
lectures. These may be supported by tutorials, problem classes and seminars
which may also be board-based.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:14.9pt'>Many of the contributions to the
guide highlight the need for full notes in specific formats to be provided
prior to classes. For some, for example a student reading in Braille or large
print, these notes may act as an alternative to the board. For others, the
provision of notes alters the main activity from copying precisely, maintaining
place in the text or retaining definitions in working memory to the desired
engagement with concepts and logical arguments. Without this provision, the
real-time development of the argument cannot be followed. However, the very
use of the board to facilitate this real-time development may mean that no
notes exist which can be converted for these students. This conundrum does not
arise in the majority of subjects where extensive board use has all but
disappeared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:78.95pt'>This issue forms part of a wider challenge for the
MSOR community, that documents and websites which contain mathematical content
may themselves be a barrier. The Subject Benchmark Statement says that
assessment should not be restricted to knowledge and understanding alone but
also to the ability to communicate effectively in the context of MSOR. Reading
and assimilating ideas typically expressed in two dimensional symbolic notation
interspersed with text and diagrams is one specialist element of MSOR communication,
along with developing effective written and oral communication of MSOR material
with both peers and staff. This might include, for instance, use of LaTeX, a
format used for the typesetting of scientific documents. However, no single
format has yet emerged which can be read or transformed to be read effectively
by all and this barrier is a recurring theme throughout the contributions to
the guide.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Differing perspectives</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:84.0pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>A student may draw on support from needs assessors,
assistive technology trainers, disability advisers, specialist mentors and
study skills tutors, librarians, careers advisers, study support, examinations
support and document conversion staff. E-learning specialists and computing
services may be responsible for ensuring access to the virtual learning
environment, computer systems and software. Most of these support professionals
will not have substantial experience of mathematical subjects and, not unreasonably,
may assume that generic approaches to access and inclusive design remain valid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:86.15pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>For example, it may be incorrectly assumed: that all
electronic resources are accessible; that Braille, large or alternative print
and speech formats can be produced automatically; that staff will typically
provide documents in editable electronic formats; that standard optical
character recognition and voice recognition software works; that students will
know how to use software such as literacy support and mindmapping programs when
faced with a proof or partial differentiation question; and, that standard
study support tutorials will be effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:84.05pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Meanwhile, lecturers and tutors in mathematics,
unlike their counterparts at a specialist school, are likely to have only
limited knowledge in the domains of the support professionals listed above. Not
unreasonably, they may assume that the student has been provided with assistive
technology, training, human support and advice appropriate to the specialist
nature of their studies and the ways in which MSOR content is communicated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:107.1pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Understanding of the nature of mathematics, how it is
communicated, taught and assessed, rests with the subject department. The
contributions to the guide evidence the value of support professionals
developing some understanding of the specialist nature of mathematics and of
departments developing their technical and pedagogic offering in awareness of
access challenges.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:74.75pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>This leads to the recommendation that students, MSOR
staff and support professionals should collaborate to identify MSOR specific
barriers, find effective solutions and ultimately design inclusive curriculum
delivery for the future.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Good practice guide</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:91.8pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>The good practice guide necessarily draws on the
particular knowledge and interests of its contributors and cannot claim to
provide a comprehensive picture. Nevertheless, with contributions from
different stakeholders  academic staff, professional support staff, disability
researchers and students  the guide aims to be a step towards the goal of
working together to develop inclusive curricula.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:86.25pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>The guide concludes with a collection of references
to resources, sources of further information and key papers with short
annotations. This list is provided to assist departments seeking MSOR
specialist information to discover resources more effectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:86.6pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Common threads that run through the contributions
indicate common challenges for inclusive practice in MSOR. Contributions
explore technical and pedagogic barriers and the way these may be formed by the
modes in which mathematics is communicated. The contributions provide strong
evidence of the need for collaboration between the MSOR community and the
support professionals in dissolving these barriers and moving together towards
the goal of inclusive curricula.</p>

semi-structured interviews conducted with staff and students from four UK
universities. These universities were chosen using a purposive sampling
approach whereby institutions that were thought to be particularly illuminating
or interesting were selected for study. Gatekeepers within these institutions,
chosen from the authors existing contacts, identified initial participants and
further participants were identified using snowball sampling. Interviews were
audio recorded and anonymised written transcripts were produced. In this paper,
university names are removed and participants names have been replaced with
pseudonyms. Staff job titles and names of departments and subjects have been

<h2 style='margin-left:90.25pt'>Accessing mathematics through alternative
formats</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Many alternative formats  e.g. Braille and speech 
are linear, and this can cause issues. Hazel felt it was difficult for her
students to understand the layout and structure of mathematics from the
linear representation. She said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:78.5pt;margin-bottom:
5.55pt;margin-left:26.0pt;line-height:117%'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:117%'>the student will ask me to read it out even though the
[Braille] resource is being produced... once the student has an idea of the
structure, the layout, where everything fits in ... he can go back to his own
resource.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:86.35pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>Hazel explained the need to produce a resource which
can be read quickly, since this may be used in a situation where the student
does not control the pace of events, for example: in a lecture room
environment its not as if they can just stop and focus on what does that
formula actually [say].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:81.3pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>David reported that having the English text of an
exam paper read to him was quicker than Braille, but it was necessary for him
to look at the mathematics on the Braille copy for any fine details of any
equations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:93.4pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>Many different standards exist for Mathematical
Braille and Sarah found Braille was being produced in a different format to
that with which her student was familiar. As an alternative to linear Braille,
David was not convinced by two-dimensional Braille, saying he didnt like how
it actually moves the Braille character... and also it sometimes will cram
letters up... a bit closer than they should be. However, he felt that if he
had used this system from the start he, probably would get used to [the differences].
He said that a student new to Mathematical Braille should give good
consideration to using a two-dimensional system, but be aware of its
drawbacks, such as the difficulty of manipulating mathematics in this format.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:89.25pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>David found that as the mathematics advanced beyond
A-level he came across symbols he didnt recognise and had trouble relating
what was said in lectures to his notes, or reading aloud his work for a scribe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:85.55pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>Instead of the whole hassle of Mathematical
Braille, John received materials in LaTeX and worked with Hazel to turn these
into a form of human readable TeX (e.g. without the LaTeX formatting commands).
John considered this to have two main advantages: this avoided the potentially
error-prone and time consuming process of conversion; and, by reading the
LaTeX, he was learning to write his own mathematics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:84.45pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>When enlarging mathematics for a large print format,
Hazel found that LaTeX sometimes put insufficient spacing between symbols so
they were printed too close to distinguish. Another issue for Lucy producing
large print and John reading Braille is breaking mathematics over several
lines. John said if you break equations in the wrong places you get the wrong
idea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:89.85pt;margin-bottom:
4.2pt;margin-left:11.1pt;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
line-height:130%'>A computer voice interface allows greater independence, but a
sighted assistant will be better placed to deal with misconceptions arising
from ambiguity. Hazel said, <i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:130%'>sometimes
[lecturers] say completely different things to what they are writing down so
they might say a plus b over c that could be a plus b all over c or that
could be a plus stop b over c.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:81.1pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>However, Hazel felt a human reader was not always
adequate because a printed resource is permanent twenty four hours a day which
I am not... even if you record [my description], you want to explore the
formula in different ways next time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:92.95pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>To access graphics, participants used a mixture of
describing graphs and providing tactile diagrams, depending on complexity and
student preference. David had diagrams described if they were simple enough,
while Eric only used this alternative to tactile diagrams on very rare
occasions where the diagram would be so complex as to necessitate a verbal
description. Jim felt descriptions were not useful as, <i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:110%'>what the [describing] person sees...
as important, is not necessarily what [I] see as important. And they tend to
either miss out features that [I] need, or just give far too much detail.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:67.65pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>The original graphics may need to be simplified to
produce a tactile version. Sarah found she needed to produce several versions
of a single graph, saying,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:67.95pt;margin-bottom:
13.4pt;margin-left:26.0pt;line-height:117%'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:117%'>I would do a separate tactile diagram with just the first
line, and then do a second one with the second line and then do one that puts
the two lines together. So we can build up the picture because I find that the
diagrams he comes with are actually quite difficult if they have multiple </span></i></p>

margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:107%'><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:5.55pt;
margin-left:104.45pt;line-height:117%'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:117%'>lines on. He tends to jump between lines quite often so its
useful if we can build up each as a separate entity and then start looking at
their interactions.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Some respondents worked with a sighted reader who
would operate mathematical software which was inaccessible, sometimes
converting software output into an alternative format. Some found alternatives
to standard software that were more accessible but use of alternatives was not
always permitted in assessments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>David reported frustration at not being able to pick
up a textbook in the library and flick through it to see if it is relevant. He
was helped by library staff, but as non-subject specialists, they didnt
really have any knowledge of what they were reading. David said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:5.55pt;
margin-left:104.45pt;line-height:117%'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:117%'>If I could see to read print then I would go across to the
library and look for a suitable book that seems to cover the areas and have a
read of that and see if that explains it.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>He felt that, had it been possible to have a Braille
textbook produced, he may have found that he didnt get on with that author or
textbook, so once he had got the textbook he may think its a waste of time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Jim was told his university could not find any
Braille mathematics textbooks, and as a result he was told he strictly only
[needed] the notes from lectures to study the course. David expressed his
frustration at not being able to read around the subject: I know that Im
probably capable of high marks but Im just not able to do it cos I havent
got the knowledge.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:90.25pt'>Conversion of materials to alternative formats</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:22.4pt;margin-bottom:
5.55pt;margin-left:106.0pt;text-indent:-14.15pt;line-height:117%'>Jim found
that adapting his non-mathematics module material was, <i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:117%'>easier, because it is just purely
texts, and now I dont actually rely on the support at all,... I just scan all
my books and read them on my computer... [The mathematics based subject] is a
bit more difficult because of all the mathematics symbols and all that, and
sometimes graphs and diagrams.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Hazel explained that part of her job was badgering
lecturers for reading lists and lecture notes as far in advance as possible.
She said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:5.55pt;
margin-left:104.45pt;line-height:117%'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:117%'>There is a lack of smoothing across the academic year... We
make every attempt to foresee this... before an academic year, we try and get
the reading lists in at the moment they are ready... but if the lecturer hasnt
written the course yet, theres not much you can do about it.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>At times, this information comes in very late and
Hazel said there are times when you are working late because a student needs a
resource [but] you hadnt got what you needed to produce it in time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Hazel supported students in modules where notes were
not available. Sometimes the lecturer had outline notes they worked from during
lectures. Hazel met with the lecturer to try to find out how closely the notes
reflect what is happening on the blackboard. She said,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:5.55pt;
margin-left:104.45pt;line-height:117%'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:117%'>This is the worst problem, trying to take a resource that
wasnt meant to be seen by students eyes and turn it into something the
student can use during the lecture to follow what is happening on the
blackboard.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
23.5pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>If notes cannot be made available these can be
taken by hand during lectures by a support worker, and then converted into an
appropriate format. David said this usually took a couple of weeks but at one
point it got really bad last year and once I didnt see a set of notes till six
weeks after the lecture. David received additional tuition but felt he was not
able to use this to full potential because he didnt know whether to talk
about the lecture he had just attended, or the notes he had just received from
a previous lecture. For one module Jim got none of the module content in
Braille until three weeks before the exam. He said he felt the whole term
was... wasted cos I... couldnt do anything for the module. And in that three
weeks I just had to revise, read up and learn.</p>

there were sometimes errors in his typed notes, but said, <i><span

the typist typing it up I may not remember the lecture well enough to know that
doesnt quite make sense to what was said in the lecture because it was so long
ago.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:57.65pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>David found errors were introduced by typists and by
Braille transcription software just not working very well. He found this a
problem because in an equation just one character can make a big difference to
the meaning. John said this can mean you often miss the point of whats being
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:76.15pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>David asked about proofreading and was told it would
just be too time consuming. As a result, he felt his Braille notes could not
be completely relied on. He said,</p>

dont even know is meant to be there and it just adds on an extra layer of

them.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>David felt that even just to do a random sample of
documents would be better than nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:75.95pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>John had trouble getting editable versions of
textbooks. At the start of the year he received a reading list and had a
panicked time trying to contact the publishers for electronic versions. He
said even when a lecturer only expects students to read a few pages here... at
times a section, it is still necessary to request the whole book.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:75.7pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>The process of contacting publishers was time
consuming. Whether they reply with an electronic copy or to say they cannot
provide this, John had never come across a case where it has taken us less
than two weeks and the longest saw the textbook requested before the start of
the academic year arriving just after the January exams, six months later.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:56.1pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>A possible solution was contacting the author
directly. Hazel said the authors range from completely ignoring us to being
extremely helpful and sometimes... give us their own electronic copies of their

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>David felt a compromise was
needed, so that it makes sense without being able to see the board but not
necessarily reading everything. Having the lecture notes in advance gives
something to follow during the lecture.</p>

them to write down everything in the same way as everyone else would.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If notes cannot be produced, students may bring an assistant

readers, scribes, amanuensis, library browsers, tutors, notetakers or in a
general support role. David felt it was necessary to take time to build a

was familiar with the subject matter. </p>

margin-left:92.6pt;text-indent:-14.15pt;line-height:117%'>Sarah felt it was

very much working with the partnership.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>Interaction with a support
worker and extra time taken to read Braille meant David received 50% extra time

however, tried not to ask for extensions. He said,</p>

going to be pushed even further and it would be kind of an escalating effect.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>Jim also tried not to ask for
extensions. He said,</p>

given fact that if you have a disability you just have to work that little bit
harder maybe,... I mean you cant ask for an extension of your life.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:17.1pt'>Nevertheless, it is worth
asking whether it is fair that students have to complete more work in the same
period of time. Some respondents reported handing in incomplete work or work
they knew to be incorrect in order to keep up with the deadlines.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:17.1pt'>Students with visual
impairments may use a number of methods to access mathematical content, and may
have very specific alternative format requirements. Whatever a students chosen
method of accessing materials, problems can arise in producing this format
accurately, reading it correctly, manipulating mathematics, accessing graphics
and producing written work. Students may require adaptations to teaching and
assessment and need alternatives to the standard equipment and software that
are generally available. Despite all this, evidence suggests that students with
visual impairments can do well in mathematics if the right support is in place.
John said if I didnt have Hazel helping me out here honestly I dont think I
would be where I am.</p>

Worcester, DSpybey@newcollegeworcester.co.uk</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>I have been Head of Mathematics
for over 25 years at New College Worcester (NCW), formerly Worcester College
for the Blind, a secondary school for visually impaired students. The visual
nature of some aspects of Mathematics has always posed difficulties for some of
my students but others have found no difficulty in visualising situations which
would have me reaching for a pen and paper to draw a diagram. One of my
earliest memories of teaching a blind student involved trying to work out the
height change in a bifilar pendulum when it rotated through a given angle. The
blind student had completed the solution whilst I was still trying to draw the
diagram!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:78.95pt'>Over the years I have taught A-level Mathematics
and Further Mathematics to a number of students who have continued to study
Mathematics, or Physics at university. Until recently I have always been
concerned as to how those students using Braille would be assisted through
their degree course. In this article I outline some of the issues for visually
impaired students but I explain why my concern for those using Braille at
university has recently been eased.</p>

<h2>A-level for visually impaired students</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'><img width=2 height=234
src="Good%20Practice%20on%20Inclusive%20Curricula%20in%20the%20Mathematical%20Sciences_files/image011.gif"
align=left hspace=12>There are no reasons why visually impaired students should
not study mathematically based subjects at A-level. The barriers are, to some
extent, less than those at GCSE level where there are far more diagrams and
topics where vision is a considerable help. The majority of A-level topics are
less diagrammatical in nature but there is still an issue of time as the
coverage of some topics is likely to be slow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:78.95pt'>Graphical calculators are a potential problem as
they have been allowed in A-level examinations for a while. So far the only
questions I have seen that require the use of a graphical calculator have been
in sections where there is choice and another topic can be answered instead.
MathTrax [1], software from NASA, can be used by blind students to give an
audible tone for a graph but it is not at all comparable with the many features
of a graphical calculator. Graphing packages on laptops can be used by partially
sighted students but I do not know of any examination board that allows these
to be used in examinations.</p>

<h2>Partially sighted students and mathematics</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:14.6pt'>Partial sight has many variants
and each student needs to be treated individually. Students may be able to
handwrite but many partially sighted students find that using a laptop enables
them to produce material that they can read more easily. Students should
consider using a word processor that can also deal with mathematical symbols.
MathType [2] can be used either in a Windows environment or a Mac OS X
environment but I only have experience of using it in Microsoft Word where it
works well. MathType allows the creation of keyboard shortcuts and initially I
spent time creating numerous in-house shortcuts for students to learn.
However, as these shortcuts needed to be repeatedly re-entered when student
laptops went wrong, I now teach the keyboard shortcuts built in to MathType.
These shortcuts are well worth using and it is easiest for students if the
shortcuts are taught when new symbols are first introduced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>Whilst a graphical calculator
may not be clear enough to see, there are software packages that enable
partially sighted students to access similar functions for classroom use. At
NCW we have used the software Autograph [3] which has the facility to create a
default of thicker lines for graphs and grids.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:69.85pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Enlarging a text book on a photocopier is a quick
and easy option but it rarely produces good quality material as the original
has not been prepared with visually impaired people in mind. Students should
ideally be provided with good quality large print materials in either printed
or electronic format.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Blind students and mathematics</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:90.85pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>The medium of Braille continues to be suitable for
those who are likely to take Mathematics only as far as A-level. All topics can
be covered, although without use of a graphical calculator. Some topics are
slow to cover; long algebraic equations can be cumbersome in Braille and matrix
work is a bit awkward to set out, but it is all possible. Three dimensional
work may require the use of models and sketching curves is often done by a
finger on a desk, rather than using drawing film, simply to save time! Pre-prepared
tactile diagrams can be used for most diagrammatic work but the original
diagrams may need to be simplified to enable the salient points of the diagram
to be clear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:81.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>A few blind students who take A-level will be
intending to continue on to a degree course that has a mathematical content.
These students should seriously consider using the method that Alastair Irving
and Robin Williams started to develop whilst studying for their A-levels at New
College Worcester (I will call this the A&amp;R method for brevity) [4]. By
making use of various software packages, a Braille strip, good computer skills
and initially considerable time and effort, they were able to produce mathematical
work of a high quality in print. Their proficiency in the method was such that
they were able to take their external examinations independently and produce a
print script for the examiners to mark. They were able to be sent material in
Microsoft Word and MathType, change it into LaTeX [5], modify the LaTeX to
create a version that they could access in either speech or Braille (using a
Braille strip attached to their laptop) or more usefully a combination of the
two. When they started to develop this method Alastair and Robin were both
confident touch typists with good IT skills and they were good mathematicians.
Since then they have continued to develop and make use of this method of
working to complete their degrees and are now following postgraduate studies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Unfortunately there is no world-wide uniformity in
the way that mathematics is written in </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:92.4pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Braille. The Nemeth Code [6] is used in the USA and
it is different from the Braille Mathematics Notation [7] used in the UK! As
the A&amp;R method was developed my input as the teacher was mainly in
providing the initial materials and in checking the final output. Alastair and
Robin dealt with the bits in the middle and they considered that the Nemeth
Code had advantages over the UK code. Any student learning to use the A&amp;R
method has this extra hurdle to deal with, although I have to say it does not
seem to have been a problem for those who have used it so far! However, it is
because of all the additional learning that needs to take place that I consider
it is really only a suitable way of working for a student who is intending to
do a subject involving mathematics at university. For these students I believe
the method creates considerable benefits in higher education and therefore
makes it well worth learning and I would suggest that it is essential if they
are to have the level of independence that they deserve.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Transition to Higher Education</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:87.7pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Students start university with considerably different
experiences and all visually impaired students need to be treated individually.
University staff, probably at departmental level, should invest time before the
start of the course to understand the problems involved. The issues surrounding
a technical subject, such as mathematics, are more complex than those for a
purely text based subject. In addition to teaching a particular subject a
department may need to teach visually impaired students methods of access and
various codes during the course.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:86.0pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>The issues for partially sighted students are likely
to be fewer in number than for those working in Braille but it important for
departments to have a clear understanding of the methods that students use to
access and prepare material.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.75pt;
margin-bottom:21.15pt;margin-left:.5pt;text-align:right;line-height:177%'><span
style='font-size:7.0pt;line-height:177%;font-family:"OCR A",serif;color:#999A9A'>Mathematics
for visually impaired students at A-level and the transition to degree level</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>Some Braille users will have had
a learning support assistant who has underwritten their Braille for their
sighted teacher to read. This means that communication between teacher and
student will, of necessity, have been mainly oral. It is possible that students
will have created their own symbols in Braille and not used the correct code
according to the Mathematics Braille Notation. Other Braille users will have
been taught by a teacher who knows the Mathematics Braille Notation and they
should have a good knowledge of the code. These students will be used to having
their Braille work marked by someone who can read it and they may expect this
to happen at university. All Braille users are unlikely to have met all of the
Braille notation that they will need to use in their degree course and the
university should consider how new elements of the code will be dealt with
during the course. There will be a certain amount of adjustment for all blind
students when they start any degree course. It is likely that an individual
student will unaware that the way they have worked at school may not be
transferrable to university. It is advisable for there to be close links
between any university and the students school before the start of the degree
course and this contact should continue during the first few months of the new
course.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>The likelihood of a blind
student being supported in higher education by someone who knows the
Mathematics Braille Notation is close to zero whereas there is a reasonably
high chance of someone in a university mathematics department being familiar
with LaTeX. This means that any student who is able to use the A&amp;R method
should find that they are able to receive material from their lecturers in a
format that they can access and they should be able to provide their lecturers
with material that their lecturers can read. The benefits of using the A&amp;R
method are considerable for both student and lecturers and providing the
opportunity for students to learn this method before the start of a course
appears to be in the best interest of all concerned. It may well be worthwhile
investigating if funding for such training is available through the support
grants for disabled students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:78.95pt'>Lecturers will still need to adapt to having a
blind student in their class in the use of language; they do not need to stop
using sighted vocabulary but they do need to be precise. Moving x from here
to here is utterly useless but saying look at equation 1 is fine as long as
the braillist has a copy of the material with equation 1 clearly labelled!
Materials obviously need to be provided before the start of lectures in a
suitably accessible format.</p>

<h2>The future for the A&amp;R method</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.3pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:78.95pt'>Learning to use the A&amp;R method is an extra
for students whether it is learnt alongside Alevels or later but it brings with
it a level of independence that should be the right of any blind student. The
advantages of it should be known about at school level and throughout academia
but current knowledge of it is limited and its documentation is sparse. Whilst
I assume that the A&amp;R method could be further developed into a simpler
single package its specialist nature means that it will always be used by only
a small number of students so I doubt if it has any commercial viability. Its
use will always be limited as the number of blind students studying
mathematically related subjects at university will be small. However, it
provides a significant breakthrough for those who use it and deserves as wide
an audience as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:85.0pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>The most common problem known to the authors facing
MSOR undergraduate students is in the obtaining of accessible reading
materials, and in the submission of written work. Here we outline the issues at
hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.05pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:56.15pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:22.7pt;text-indent:-11.35pt'> Scientific documents are by
their nature nonlinear in their format. A simple example is the two-dimensional
form of a fraction. As severely VI people, we must rely on speech and Braille
output, and are therefore confined to work in a one-dimensional space. Even
with the most up-to-date technology available, we feel there is no satisfactory
solution to dealing with this nonlinearity other than by means of a linear
representation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:87.75pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:22.7pt;text-indent:-11.35pt'> Intuitively, the most natural
means of reading MSOR documents would seem to be Braille. Braille is a linear
format with a sophisticated mathematics code. However as described in the
section on assistive technology and implications, acquiring properly translated
Braille is a highly complicated task which is not yet possible from a source
file such as a PDF copy of a textbook.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:87.9pt;margin-bottom:

replacement in LaTeX, using the actual LaTeX source code. The source file is
linear in its nature, and is thus suitable for use with assistive technology.

document of any length or complexity, LaTeX source code is somewhat complicated
and long-winded to be read in its raw form. We have therefore developed a set
of script files to process a line of LaTeX code into a more audible rendering
of the mathematical content, as well as to an accurate translation of that
particular line into Braille. This system, which we have named LaTeX-access
[6], is described below.</p>

materials to be obtained are lecture notes. We highly recommend that lecturers
be encouraged to produce a copy of their notes in LaTeX, whether the source
file is written to produce slides, notes to be handed out to the entire class,
or simply notes which the lecturer refers to during the course of the lecture.
The student can then follow the lecture by referring to the notes on a laptop
computer, rather than having to spend time catching up afterwards. We found
that significant benefits in learning were gained from courses in which well
prepared notes in LaTeX were available, and in which transcribers were not
required to type up handwritten notes into LaTeX after the lecture. Indeed,
there is a significant correlation in one of the authors exam results between
those courses in which good notes were available and those in which
transcription services had to be used. In any case, having well prepared notes
is good general departmental practice.</p>

obtain accessible copies of diagrams, which may for example have been drawn on
a blackboard by the lecturer or form an important part of a textbook. This can
often be a time consuming and somewhat haphazard process, and so we recommend
that careful consideration be given to the selection of those diagrams which
are really necessary (many diagrams are just used to increase the visual appeal
of the material and are not needed to understand the mathematics). Depending on
the quality of diagram required, a simple sketch on German Film or use of a
ZyFuse machine (see above) may well suffice. Alternatively, if the diagram is
available as a computer-generated image, a Braille embosser could be used to
print a higher resolution diagram. It should be noted that tactile diagrams are
limited in their resolution. We strongly recommend that work be carried out to
reduce high resolution diagrams to show the most important features before
embossing, diagrams of too high a resolution are likely to be indiscernible to
the user and of no practical use.</p>

consigned to the past. </p>

whilst being able to work with speech and Braille by using the LaTeX-access

continues to do so at the postgraduate level.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:

language and are available from [6]. The scripts translate the line of LaTeX at
which the cursor is located into a more audible rendering of the mathematics
(which is output by the screen reading software), and into a Braille
translation (which is output on the refreshable Braille display).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
34.45pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>The scripts enable easier reading of a variety of
MSOR features written in LaTeX. On a simple level, many symbols (such as Greek
letters, statistical and group theory notation) are translated into speech and
Braille. For example, fractions using the \frac command are translated into
Braille and spoken as a over b, where a and b are the numerator and
denominator respectively. Subscripts and superscripts, as well as formatting
commands such as \mathbf are accounted for both in Braille and by a change of
pitch in speech.</p>

that the user can read up and down columns or along different rows without
moving the cursor position, an improvement on what is possible with the raw
source in which only a single line can be viewed at any one time. Similar
functionality is implemented to enable easier reading of tables.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:72.55pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>We stress that the scripts are not an attempt to
perform a full translation of the LaTeX document, such as that described in the
section on assistive technologies above. Rather, the scripts translate only the
current line. They do not handle the more style-based features of LaTeX, such
as cross-referencing of equations. The scripts cannot therefore be used to
produce hard-copy Braille, such features are of no interest to us as we feel it
to be advantageous to read and edit the LaTeX in real time.</p>

windows-based text editor. Currently support is available for the JAWS screen
reader, with work ongoing for support by the open-source screen reader NVDA at
the time of writing. The scripts have also been ported to a usable level for
use in the Emacspeak package under the Linux operating system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:85.95pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>The choice of editor in which to read and write
LaTeX is important. Some editors have accessibility issues, such as the latest
versions of WinEDT under Windows. We recommend the use of Emacs with an
installation of the AucTeX package for producing LaTeX documents. Emacs has no
major accessibility problems and is extremely powerful. In particular, we make
extensive use of the macros which enable keyboard shortcuts to be used for the
fast production of common LaTeX code, this considerably reduces the time involved
in typing the entire document manually. However the choice of editor is
flexible and is a matter of taste.</p>

software often performs well, although the supplied files must be of a
sufficiently high resolution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:79.55pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Here we have outlined methods which have enabled us
to study mathematics at HE level and provide a good foundation for the
continuation of our study at postgraduate level. Our thoughts come as
recommendations only, and are not necessarily applicable to all students. It is
however our strongly held belief that adoption of the use of LaTeX is the most
efficient and accessible method of working for severely visually impaired
students. We feel it is unreasonable and unnecessary to expect students to
adopt LaTeX as a method of working at earlier ages, although we suggest that a
student who intends to study an MSOR subject at the HE level should be advised
to familiarise themselves with LaTeX before the start of their course.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:61.65pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>LaTeX is also a highly suitable format for producing
documents for people who are partially sighted, but who may require larger
fonts or unusual colour contrasts. These can be easily set in the LaTeX source
file, thus circumventing the need to involve lengthy transcription services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:17.1pt'>An area of potential conflict
is in the expectations of the department and institution from the student, and
vice versa. We feel it necessary to stress that the student should expect to
display a reasonable level of proactivity in dealing with their accessibility
needs. After all, the student is likely to be the best person to understand the
areas in which he / she has difficulties.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This paper is based on my experiences in one-to-one
mathematics support to students with additional needs, in particular dyslexia.
It will build on a number of case studies, in order to explore the differences
that students experience and the errors they are likely to make. The aim is to
show how greater accessibility could help the dyslexic mathematician focus on
developing their mathematics and demonstrate their capabilities. Three areas
will be covered, namely: reading, writing and memory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05in;margin-bottom:17.1pt;
margin-left:78.95pt'>Dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty It is likely
to be present at birth and to be lifelong in its effects. It is characterised
by difficulties with phonological processing, rapid naming, working memory,
processing speed and the automatic development of skills that may not match up
to an individuals other cognitive abilities. It tends to be resistant to
conventional teaching methods, but its effects can be mitigated by
appropriately specific intervention [1].</p>

<h2>Barrier: reading</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:1.05pt'>The first area to consider is
reading. The dyslexic student may have difficulty reading connecting text or
have a slower reading speed. Frequently, dyslexic students are attracted to the
study of mathematics because it is perceived as requiring a lower level of
reading text. One very able mathematics student, Joe, with high non-verbal
ability, arrived at university with a very low level of reading, which had
persisted from his earliest years. He was unable to read simple text
effectively. Handouts and instruction sheets given out in lecture or lab
sessions were particularly difficult for this student. Support work focused on
identifying and understanding key words, symbols and procedures used in a
variety of mathematical contexts, such as the statement of the tasks,
examination questions or lecture notes. These key words enable a clearer focus
in order to prioritise responses. It was also important for his academic tutors
to provide material in advance of lectures and in the more accessible sans
serif fonts, such as Arial, Verdana, Comic Sans or Trebuchet. For contextual
text surrounding mathematics, Verdana is arguably preferable as the symbolic
elements are clearer. Documents should be well spaced with clear headings. A
coloured background helps to reduce the glare that many dyslexic students
encounter through visual stress: the inability to see comfortably without
distortion and discomfort [2]. Colour preferences can be individual and each
student will respond to a different combination of coloured background,
coloured text, spacing and fonts. It is important, therefore, to make all notes
and handouts available for students to download and format as they choose.
Figure 1 (overleaf) shows one of the visual stress affects (whirlpool) that
some students may experience and figure 2 (overleaf) shows the text in a more
suitable format [3].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another dyslexic mathematics student, Kate, had excellent
numerical skill and a vivid visual memory; however, these strengths were offset
by her weaker reading speed and accuracy, which only scored in the first
percentile of the population. She also frequently lost her place when reading
and had poor working memory. Support for Kate focused on the dissection and
simplification of the more worded problems into a more manageable form. This
included the use of bullet points to split text into smaller chunks, highlighting
key information in two colours that distinguished the given information from
the required instruction, e.g. to obtain a differential equation. It should be
noted, at this point, that Kate had no difficulty at all with a page of
mathematics almost devoid of connecting text, such as a solution to a
differential equation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:77.15pt;margin-bottom:
8.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Another particular issue for Kate was the use of
mathematics course text books. Henderson [4] notes that in mathematical texts,
tables, graphs and diagrams often intersperse text and each of these can have
its own labels and subtext. Examples are often worked out in the middle of
information or text on how to complete the calculation, so that if you have
trouble reading the connecting text you may ignore both the text and the
example. This irregularity is particularly an issue for dyslexic students. Kate
found this to be the case for one book in particular that formed a core text.
The interspersion of text and mathematics was high and many of the figures were
out of order so that, for example, half way down a page it referred to a figure
that was on the following page, or even a couple of pages further on. Kate
would turn to the required figure, study it, but rarely returned to the point
of the text. This meant that the sense was lost and the work without meaning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:76.55pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>An essential requirement has to be the accessibility
of text to students with dyslexia. Whenever possible the use of text books such
as above should be avoided. Notes and worksheets should be made available
beforehand and sans serif fonts used at all times. It is also useful for
dyslexic students who find it difficult to read and interpret the feedback
given on assignments, to have an MP3 recording of this feedback.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Barrier: writing</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:88.75pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>A second area that sometimes poses issues for the
dyslexic is that of writing. Andrew was a physics student who excelled in
non-verbal elements, had good number skills and sound reading comprehension. He
was very articulate and a good physics student. However, he struggled to
process at speed and had a poor working memory. His writing speed was assessed
as being in the 5<sup><span style='font-size:9.5pt;line-height:110%'>th</span></sup>
percentile for the population. Andrew was holistic in his approach to tasks,
working in a non-sequential way that arose from his intuitive feel for a
situation. He was, above all, insightful. However, invariably this led to
non-standard solutions and poor documentation of his method. His dyslexia also
meant that he was inaccurate and made frequent errors. One example occurred
during an exercise involving a series of row operations on a 4 by 4 matrix. His
poor written presentation meant that the rows and columns were far from aligned
so that the entries became confused and, having started with a 4 by 4, ended
with a non-aligned 4 by 3. The use of centimetre squared paper was helpful in
this instance. A second example occurred when Andrew was undertaking
integration by parts of <i>cosh h cos h </i>with respect to h. The similarity
of the two functions when written down caused errors in his writing and
presentation of the solution. However, he was very clear about the nature of
the problem and its solution. Andrew miscopied <i>cos h</i> as <i>cosh h</i> as
well as the converse. Throughout, Andrews written submissions did not have a
logical order, flow or cohesion and there were frequent copying errors that
occurred when transferring between media, pages </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
8.6pt;margin-left:78.95pt'>or lines. Frustratingly, Andrew had an insight into
the problems that enabled him to see the potential for solution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:4.8pt;line-height:112%'><b><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:112%'>Recommendations:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:78.95pt'>Accessibility for dyslexic students should,
therefore, include the willingness to accept less well documented solutions or
facilitating the students to talk through their ideas and solutions. There
should also be a willingness to accept sketches that are poorly defined (in the
case of a dyspraxic student) and give a choice of diagram or description. It is
frequently considered inappropriate to comment on spelling in essays and
written work that comes from a dyslexic student; this would appear to be equivalent
to the copying errors in mathematics. Fundamentally, it is about addressing the
students understanding of the mathematics.</p>

<h2>Barrier: memory</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>The third and final area for
consideration in this paper is that of memory. Andrew had a poor working
memory. It was important for him to draw on his visualisation skills in order
to see situations. Indeed, Benoit Mandelbrot, the famous mathematician, had
similar strengths:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.8pt;margin-bottom:5.55pt;
margin-left:92.35pt;line-height:117%'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:117%'>(Mandelbrot) was not a good student; it was said that he
never learned the alphabet (he could never use a telephone directory, for
example), nor his multiplication tables past five. Despite his poor performance
at school, he found that he had a quite extraordinary ability to visualise
mathematical questions and solve problems with leaps of geometric intuition
rather than the proper established techniques of strict logical analysis.
After the war he passed the entrance exams for the École Polytechnique,
achieving the highest grade in Algebra by translating the questions mentally
into pictures </span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:117%'>[5].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>Notation also contributes to the
load on memory as students have to remember a wide range of standard notations
throughout their studies. Michael Faraday [6] wrote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:5.55pt;
margin-left:92.35pt;line-height:117%'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:117%'>Mathematical formulae, more than anything else, require
quickness and surety in receiving and retaining the true value of the symbols,
and when one has to look back at every moment to the beginning of a paper, to
see what H or A or B mean, there is no making way. Still, though I cannot hold
the whole train of reasoning in my mind at once, I am able fully to appreciate
the value of the results...</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.05in'>Issues of memory not only
encompass remembering the symbolic notation needed, but also linking symbol,
word and process. For example, in integration the integration sign, the word
integration and the process itself have to all be linked together. Students
also need to frequently hold all aspects of a problem and various partial
solutions in mind. An example of this is a partial differentiation problem.
This type of question is most usually answered in a linear format, one partial
derivative following another, and bringing these together later. For a dyslexic
student, some of the earlier partial derivatives are forgotten and overlooked
so that the final solution becomes intangible. By using a branching diagram, it
is possible to create a situation whereby several partial derivatives can be
kept at the same horizontal eye level. This eye-level is also an issue in
scrolling because screen-sized information can be referred to, but if scrolling
is necessary, then information from the top of the page will be easily
forgotten as the scrolling moves down the page. See figure 3 (overleaf).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>Many students have significant
difficulties thinking and reasoning about mathematical concepts [7]. Often
this follows from a definition or theorem. These definitions and theorems
feature in many examination papers, often requiring students to state a particular
definition or theorem, before going on to reason a proof. When statements of
definitions or theorems (without proof) are assessed, it is a test of rote
recall. One mathematics module contained 16 definitions and 42 theorems and the
end of module examination devoted 24% of the marks to the recall of definitions
and theorems, excluding the proof. While it is accepted that certain
definitions and theorems are of prime importance, their rote learning appears
to place at a disadvantage those students who find such learning difficult, but
who fully comprehend the mathematics and who can develop the proof and utilise
it appropriately.</p>

avoided so that examinations do not rely on memory, and all necessary theorems
and formulae are provided, together with a list of terms and notation used. It
is also helpful to have consistent notation across modules and staff within a
department. If there is a reduced load on the working memory, students can
focus on understanding the mathematics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Asperger Syndrome (AS) is on the autism spectrum
and associated with at least average intelligence [1]. This paper draws on
experiences of students with AS to raise awareness of the challenges which
might be associated with studying mathematics at university and suggests
potential solutions. The REAL (Reliable, Empathic, Anticipatory and Logical)
approach, which has been found to be most effective [2] is briefly introduced.
This approach begins with excellent pre-entry support and advice, is mindful of
the potential impact of all transitions and respects the individuality of every
student.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:90.25pt'>Background</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Martin [2], while cautioning against stereotyping,
found the most typical student with AS to be male, in his early twenties,
studying science based undergraduate courses, having achieved good A level
grades. There is no such thing as a one size fits all solution but some
common themes have emerged regarding the challenges university may present, and
about effective ways to assist learners to achieve success. Commentary directly
from students is quoted throughout this paper (some of which is unpublished, for
example, Madriaga et al. transcripts [3]). All necessary permission has been
obtained and anonymity is protected.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:90.25pt'>Characteristics of AS</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Baron-Cohen [4] describes the cognitive style of
people with AS as usually systematic rather than empathic. Strengths are mainly
around dedication, application, high levels of interest and motivation and
often a logical approach [4,5]. Students who have AS apparently flourish in
environments which minimise chaos and maximise order. Application and focus are
positive characteristics associated with AS. Arnold reflects, from personal
experience: <i>Obsessive narrow interests can be valuable. Take computers for instance.
Most people can just use them, but I can strip down and rebuild mine.</i> [5,
p.2]. Examples of very able mathematicians and scientists thought to have AS
pepper the literature [6] although this can contribute the genius pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:14.15pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Typically challenges relate to social inclusion,
communication and flexibility of imagination; sensory overload is also often
reported [7]. The world can seem rather confusing when other people are
inconsistent and focussing on details rather than the bigger picture can
sometimes generate greater feelings of security in an uncertain world.
Confusion can lead to anxiety which can manifest in attempts to maintain
consistency and in fear of change. Transitions, such as starting at university
or commencing a placement, can therefore be especially troubling [3]. Seemingly
little things can perpetuate apparently disproportionate responses mainly
because of difficulty with the flexible application of problem solving skills,
memories of previous negative experience and uncertainty about the motivation
of other people [8].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
11.75pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>When starting university many students with AS
lack extensive prior social experience  often as a result of having been
bullied and left out while at school [9]: <i>People have to bear in mind that
if you have AS you have probably been bullied for most of your life</i>
(p.243). Having had </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:84.65pt;margin-bottom:
.15pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>limited opportunities to make relationships while
growing up the subtleties of communication with strangers can be a bit of a
mystery as information is often implied rather than stated. <i>Part of the
pattern of AS is not being able to read or reciprocate non-verbal
communication. In fact, I do not seem to understand it, nor do I fit in well in
conventional social situations</i> [5, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:31.45pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>p.4]. Others cannot be relied upon to empathise and
may stereotype people with AS rather than appreciating individuality [10].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:87.1pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>There is clear evidence that students with AS can
acquire strategies which are conducive to success in HE [3,11] however,
perfectionism can be a side effect of an imposed identity in school as a
special needs child. Sadly under-employment and unemployment after graduation
is common, therefore assistance to get onto the next stage may well be needed
[12]. Employees with AS can thrive in areas which play to their systematic and
logical strengths [4] but the social environment of the work place, and team
work, like group work at university can pose difficulties unless handled
empathically by colleagues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:76.4pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>To summarise, people with AS may have strengths in
systematic logical thinking, application, staying power and hard work, deep
narrow interests leading to the acquisition of expert knowledge and
perfectionism.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:109.6pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>However, challenges may include: other peoples
attitudes and behaviours; imagining  novel situations, and working out what to
do; utilising effective problem solving, planning  and organisational skills,
especially in an unfamiliar context; seeing the bigger picture; predicting
likely outcomes and understanding other peoples motivation, and unclear
communication; anxiety about coping (socially, academically and practically) in
unpredictable, ambiguous contexts; depression, often relating to feelings of isolation
and previous negative peer experiences; issues with the sensory environment;
being misinterpreted by others and perfectionism.</p>

6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>What are typical experiences of mathematics,
statistics and operational research (MSOR) study? Analysis of the National
Students Survey [13] reports strong positive experiences of students in MSOR.
This includes <i>criteria used in marking have been clear in advance</i> and
substantially stronger positive responses than in all other subject areas for <i>assessment
arrangements and marking have been fair</i>, <i>feedback on my work has been
prompt</i>, <i>I have been able to contact staff when I have needed to</i>,
<i>changes in the course or teaching have been communicated effectively</i>
and <i>course is well organised and is running smoothly</i>. This suggests a
different and common experience, which might be summarised as a transparent and
ordered approach to learning, and is likely to enable students with AS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:89.7pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>In contrast, there are reported negative
commonalities  MSOR places near bottom for <i>staff have made the subject
interesting</i>. Students with high levels of interest may expect their peers
to share this regardless of the teaching. It can be disappointing and confusing
if those around you do not seem to have the same passion and this may impact on
engagement. MSOR places bottom in <i>the course has helped me present myself
with confidence</i> and <i>my communication skills have improved</i>. These
are two areas in which students with AS may find it more difficult to develop
their skills independently of their course of study and this could have
substantive impacts on accessing placements and employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:91.35pt;margin-bottom:

transition for all undergraduates in mathematics. It is noted that <i>Generally,
students are surprised by both the teaching method at university and the nature
of university mathematics.</i> Challis et al. found that informal support from
other students, including those in later years, is particularly important in
gaining confidence in new methods and reflecting on them. A student with AS may
find the sharp transition to university mathematics particularly challenging
and may be less likely to draw on informal peer support.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:6.85pt'>Attendees at the HE STEM
curriculum summit [15] produced a list of intended mathematics graduate
attributes that include areas in which students with AS may show considerable
strength such as <i>the ability (and desire) to learn more and go further</i>
and <i>enthusiasm for the subject</i>. The list also includes areas which may
be more of a challenge such as <i>the ability to communicate mathematics</i>,
<i>some knowledge of the culture of mathematics</i> and <i>flexibility</i>.
This latter was highlighted as playing a key role in handling unfamiliar
problems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.3pt;margin-bottom:17.1pt;
margin-left:78.95pt'>The Subject Benchmark [16] highlights that MSOR subjects
are largely cumulative and hence that ideas can take time to be assimilated.
This can be unsettling for all students but may provoke anxiety for a student
with AS as attaining understanding may appear unpredictable. A key skill that
MSOR graduates are expected to acquire is problem-solving including transferral
of expertise to unfamiliar contexts which students with AS may find more
challenging. Finally it is noted that seeing arguments developed in real time
on the board is an essential part of MSOR teaching. The sensory environment of
a lecture may prove distracting for some students with AS and could impact on
the ability to process concepts in real time while taking precise notes from
the board.</p>

inadequate information and early support. Beardon and Edmonds [9] participants
suggested that staff, including those at open days, should have more awareness

pre-entry information and assistance is helpful and that explicit experience
can be encouraging: <i>I undertook one weeks tasting course [...] it actually
proved to work well</i>.</p>

turned off. Students dont need the emotional overload of another persons
frustration. It is easier to understand that which is stated rather than
implied. Clarity, predictability, logical explanations and tangible
expectations contribute to security and underpin conditions for success.
Explicitly communicating that it takes time to assimilate new concepts and
teaching study strategies which assist with this may help to reduce anxiety.
For students struggling with the sensory environment provision of full notes
for annotation can enable the focus to be on understanding.</p>

anything else. For instance: <i>What was the most dreadful was probably what
other students looked forward to [...] the breaks between lessons</i> (p.157);
<i>I need a quiet study area</i> (p.157); <i>Social isolation, depression,
anxiety</i> (p.158); <i>Help understanding social expectations</i> (p.165);
<i>small groups who have similar likes to me [...] places where its not rowdy</i>
(p.233).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>Academic departments may have a
limited role in meeting the social and emotional needs of students but
assistance in forming social groups is recommended good practice to support
transition for all students in mathematics [14].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.9pt;margin-bottom:8.6pt;
margin-left:78.95pt'>A department based work room or allotted times in a Maths
and Stats Centre where students are concentrating on completion of mathematics
work may provide a place to go between classes, a suitable work environment and
ease access into the mathematical community. Clearly timetabled activities
within such rooms can provide support to all students. For instance, older peer
mentors trained to facilitate informal group problem solving or examining of
the big picture may assist all students to form the informal study groups
known to be important as well as providing input from older students and
practice in communicating mathematics. Structured social elements may also be
introduced by departments. For example, the Maths Arcade [17] which brings
staff and students together to explore mathematical strategy games and puzzles
builds naturally on shared interests and enthusiasms for exploring mathematics
and problem solving. Explicit investigation is needed to determine whether such
departmental provision might provide a structure which enables students with AS
to work in informal groups or socialise within the department.</p>

environment is one of benefit to all students and given the results reported by
Hewson [13] may already be delivered in many  mathematics departments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:77.65pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>For some students support from a specialist tutor may
be beneficial. A specialist tutor who has sufficient understanding of the
transition to HE study, course structure, learning approaches, problem-solving,
culture and communication in MSOR can help build skills suitable for
mathematical study. Other students may meet regularly with an academic tutor. A
shared enthusiasm for particular areas of mathematics can facilitate
communication and permit guidance in personal mathematical projects. This may
ease frustrations regarding perceived lack of interest from peers or due to
limited coverage of areas of special interest in formal lectures as well as
increasing confidence and communication skills.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:76.05pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Formal group work is often described as a cause for
anxiety, largely around unclear expectations and the feeling that peers are not
taking the task seriously. The following is typical.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:81.6pt;margin-bottom:
4.95pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:110%'><i>My marks will go down because
those bastards didnt do what they said they were going to do and didnt give a

has implications for my whole degree classification. Ive tried emailing them
but they dont bother to even respond and now I am so totally stressed out that
I feel like giving up. When we have to present it I am going to look like I
havent even bothered but its not me its those other jokers and I really feel
like I hate them</i>. (Personal communication with Martin, reported with

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:58.95pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Beardon et al. [11] suggested that group work could
include marks for the extent to which every group member was included, had a
clearly defined role, carried it out, and fed back to their team.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:87.0pt;margin-bottom:
8.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Work placement was identified by Beardon and Edmonds
[9] as a potential source of agitation mainly around lack of clarity about what
was expected coupled often with perfectionism. Academic tutors and departmental
placement officers may have a role here alongside staff in Careers and
Disability Services. Martin [18] suggests that producing a short introductory
statement may work for some students.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>REAL services</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:60.75pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Some students with AS do not want to access disabled
student support because they have chosen to reinvent themselves at university:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:81.6pt;margin-bottom:
4.95pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:110%'><i>Having had a diagnosis of
Aspergers syndrome in school, as an adult you feel like you can never actually
participate normally in everything with everyone else. If you think I am going
to go and get any more special needs help, you can get lost.</i> (Personal
contact of Martin, reported with permission).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Publicising a range of general (rather than disability
related) services, and encouraging students to ask for help may be a way
forward: <i>I find it hard to ask for help [...] almost as if Ive failed</i>
[3]. For instance, provision of support in recognising when and how to access
mathematics help is considered general good practice during the transition to
mathematical study at higher level [14]. Such provision embedded within the
department or a Maths and Statistics Centre, ideally alongside advice on mathematical
study skills for all, is likely to be acceptable. Ensuring such services are
Reliable, Empathic, Anticipatory and Logical (REAL) has been found to be
effective in enabling students with AS [2] and is likely to benefit all
students.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reliability is essential. Students lose confidence quickly
if they are let down and the requirement for backup will fluctuate at different
stages and transitions. Building a service around a small reliable team is most
effective.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Empathy is a two way street. An empathic respect for
individuality is necessary in order to avoid the pitfalls of the one size fits
all AS support package or the expectation that everyone conform to a stereotype
of what students are like. For instance, understanding that group work may be a
cause for concern will help staff to work with the student to put something
useful in place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anticipating that unexpected changes, lack of clarity and
ambiguity can cause anxiety is a good starting point. Planning to communicate
with clarity, advise in advance of known changes, and to assist the student to
get from one stage to another in their course will be helpful. It is quite
possible for this to occur with minimum fuss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:17.15pt;line-height:110%'>University
can be a self-esteem enhancing experience as illustrated in the following
examples from the Madriaga et al. transcripts [3]: <i>I wanted to do the
project by myself and I did a very good job actually. It was the first time and
I was very proud of it [] I didnt want to go and ask for help because I
wanted to show people that I can do something by myself.</i>; <i>My dream,
for as long as I can remember, was to go to university</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>This review of key issues in making maths accessible
to disabled students, when presented online, draws on experiences over the last
5 years, or so, at the Open University. The cooperation of colleagues
especially: Tim Lowe (Lecturer in Maths) and Jonathan Fine (Technical Developer
in Learning and Teaching Solutions) in helping to compile and discuss them is
acknowledged with thanks. There is a fuller but older (2008) paper published by
the author, et. al. discussing some of these issues, particularly for visually
impaired students [1].</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Firstly, a few notes about the Open University to
set the review in context. The Open University (OU), a world leader in distance
learning, attracts many disabled students with its flexible approach to
teaching and learning. Here are a few statistics about the OU and comparisons
with the averaged statistics for all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in
the UK collected by the Higher Education Statistical Agency (HESA) [2]. (The OU
figures are averages of monthly totals for UK based students for 2010 and the
HESA figures are taken from their free online data tables for 2010/11) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Total number of OU active students = 190,000 (9.1%
of HESA National Total all HEIs)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Total number of OU disabled students = 11,100 (6.3%
of HESA National Total all HEIs)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Percentage of students declaring a disability at OU
= 5.8%</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>HESA percentage of students declaring a disability
for all HEIs = 7.3%</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Visual Impairment: 11% of OU disabled students; HESA
average for all HEIs = 2%</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Dyslexia: 24% of OU disabled students; HESA average
for all HEIs = 48.9%</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:14.55pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>In summary, the OU has 6.3% of the UK total of
higher education students declaring a disability and the number of its students
declaring a disability as a percentage of the total student population is
slightly less than the national average. The profile of the disabled student
population according to disability is radically different from the average for
all institutions. This, as far as is known, has not been studied in depth but
it is suspected that key factors here are the preferences of students with different
disabilities for different modes of study and support. So, as examples, the OU
has many more visually impaired students and much fewer students with dyslexia
studying with it than you would expect at most institutions from the nationally
average data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>There are two significant distinctions about the OU
compared with most other HEIs that are relevant to this review of issues.</p>

order of letters that conveys meaning. In maths it is the 2 dimensional
relative positioning of symbols, their relative sizes, etc., that codes
meaning. Maths is a symbolic language whose representation aids its
manipulation. Examples of this are the way we readily cancel identical terms in
an algebraic equation, or the mantra (which at least the author learnt at
school) for simple differentiation: bring the power to the front and reduce
the power by one which soon becomes visualized around the symbolic
representation.</p>

by the W3C, the open standards community for the World Wide Web [7]. There are

<h3 style='margin-left:90.25pt'>Note on maths and Braille</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Braille is important to some learners with visual
impairments but only about 15% of people in the UK who are blind (of all ages)
are competent Braille users. Some mathematicians who are blind extensively use
Braille mathematics code; although a very small percentage of people who are
blind ever learn this. There are numerous variations in the way maths is
encoded in the Braille schemes of different countries. Firstly English as
represented in the Braille codes of the UK and the USA, for example, differs
considerably; then UK Braille mathematics code differs from Nemeth Code
commonly used in the USA and Marburg used in Germanic countries. Alt-texts of
maths expressions rendered as Braille by a screenreader and refreshable Braille
display are not expressions in Braille mathematics code but Braille equivalents
of the English descriptions of the maths. What should a universitys response
be to the needs of Braille mathematics code users? If a students preferred way
of interaction with maths is through Maths Braille all reasonable steps should
be made by the educational establishment to accommodate this. The Open
University uses specialist external transcription agencies for this for course
texts. However online presentation can be more challenging; e.g. in some formative
assessments mathematical expressions are parameterised differently on each
visit by the student. It can be difficult to accommodate the needs of Braille
mathematics code users in such circumstances depending on implementation.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Note on TeX and LaTeX</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:82.75pt;margin-bottom:
8.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>An example of an encoding of maths, based on print
approaches, is the extensive use that has been made of TeX or LaTeX [8]. Many
professional mathematicians and authors or editors of texts including
mathematics use tools that result in encodings based on these. LaTeX is a
document preparation system for the TeX typesetting program. It offers
programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for
automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including
important features for maths such as vertical alignment of text. LaTeX,
originally written in 1984, has become the dominant method for using TeX and
few people write in plain TeX anymore. LaTeX is used as an email exchange
format for maths by many mathematicians. Some professional mathematicians who
are blind are able to conceptualise directly from LaTeX code and it has become
their native format of the symbolic language, i.e. they read, write and
mentally process maths in LaTeX. It may be true that students who are blind
arriving to study maths at university have also developed this skill in their
school education, particularly if they come from a specialist school for
students with visual impairments. However this is less likely to be the case
for students who need to use mathematics in the context of study of another
discipline. So, whereas giving access to LaTeX code may represent a good
solution for some disabled students, particularly those with no useable sight,
it is not the case for all. This issue is particularly pressing at the OU
because students may begin study with limited prior experience of interacting
with maths in electronic formats.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Issues of interaction</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:51.85pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Maths presented online is not to be just passively
read. Students need to interact with and manipulate the maths. They may need
to:</p>

8.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>So the tools they use for this and their
compatibility with the online coding needs to be considered too.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Issues of pedagogy</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:88.55pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Mathematics is used differently in different
contexts. For example compare a Level 3 Maths course (equivalent to final year
of an undergraduate course) with the basic calculations in an introduction to
social-science course or more markedly, an Openings course<a href="#_ftn4"

seeking to take the student through over their period of study? For the
disabled student this might include a transition in the way they interact with
mathematics. It should be noted that choices made about how maths is presented
online do not just impact on the possibility and ease of perception of the
notation but on the learning itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:75.4pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>It is important not to forget assessment. Basically
the techniques and accommodations students use in their learning must be
available in their assessments both summative and formative. However a full
discussion of access issues related to maths in assessment is beyond the scope

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Current practice at the OU</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:70.1pt;margin-bottom:
8.5pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>The maths department normally writes courses in TeX;
however other departments and faculties vary and common practice includes the
use the Equation Editor for Word. For long texts PDFs are produced with figure
descriptions. Audio descriptions may be recorded. This is the case for MU123 (a
pre-calculus basic level maths course with approximately 3,500 students
registering each year). The OUs VLE program (2005-2008) was a major investment
by the University in adopting and adapting Moodle<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup><span style='font-size:9.5pt;line-height:110%'><sup><span
style='font-size:9.5pt;line-height:110%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;
color:#181717'>[5]</span></sup></span></sup></a> integrated with a range of
other technologies and tools. One of the sub-projects of this programme
produced a MathML filter. If MathML is present in a web resource it is
processed, server-side, so that it can be displayed irrespective of which
browser or associated plug-ins the student is using. Students can select user
options so that either a graphics presentation is served or access to the
MathML code is made available to their browser and any assistive technology.
The default setting is for the display of images. VLE user settings cover size
and colour contrast preferences for those students who need to adjust these to
readily read maths. However these approaches are still not used a great deal by
students; but have also not been widely promoted. There has only been 1
presentation of introductory course MU123 so far. We dont really know how
helpful these approaches are being to disabled students. Some non-disabled
students are using image enlargement (picked up from forums) where others have
discovered that TeX within $$  $$ is rendered by Moodle (this is a Moodle
feature not turned off  but not advertised).</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:78.95pt'>Browser issues with MathML  issues of support
for the OU</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.0pt;margin-bottom:8.6pt;

called MathPlayer (they have recently developed the plugin for I.E. 9.0).
Firefox does not support MathML in HTML but does support it in XHTML; the
Chrome, Safari and Opera web browsers support MathML natively (however there
are some version and consistency of display issues). This presents an issue for
the users (students) and an IT support challenge so, as stated above, the
OU-VLE defaults to displaying images.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:78.95pt'>What the OU is seeking to move towards</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:8.6pt'>Two high level objectives are to
get maths content on the VLE in a more interactive fashion and to more easily
manage student choices of what presentations of maths best suits them. There
are some known usability issues we want to address. For example: currently,
when in a quiz, where radio buttons are displayed next to an expression,
rendered from MathML, it is easy to click on the expression instead of
selecting the radio button, this is due to a Design Science plug-in feature, to
magnify on hover, having unintended consequences. We also want to overcome a
current problem where users experience some delay when loading web pages with
multiple images of maths expressions.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:78.95pt'>Outstanding issues</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>The fact that there is no one
right answer for how maths should be handled in web content means different
people within the University argue for different solutions to key issues. Given
the OUs centralised production model, one issue of particular importance is:
what should be specified as the base format that maths should be stored in;
before transformation to other formats as required? Some argue for MathML
others TeX. Given that selection then what are the best authoring tools to
offer academics that need to write courses containing maths? MathML is
currently only used on a few courses, so we have had limited experience with
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A fundamental issue is that we dont know enough about the
users (the students) and their experience of interacting with maths online.
This is a planned subject for future research. A new course M347 Mathematical
Statistics will be making substantial use of MathML. It is the first third
level maths course to be presented on the VLE only. Its first presentation is
due in February 2012. This will be a crucial course for institutional learning;
we will know a lot more after we have gone through the development and first
presentation of this course.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Unresolved dilemmas</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:75.2pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>There are sometimes issues of how to meet disabled
students needs without reducing quality for other students. An example of this
occurs in current situations where MathML is used. It is estimated more than
95% of students are not receiving any benefits where MathML is being used.
Arguably they receive a poorer visual rendering of the maths than they would
have with images generated from LaTeX. However it should be noted that no
complaints about this have been received. There is the future possibility of supplementing
MathML with images supplied from original TeX to address this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:67.15pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>There are curriculum issues, of graduateness.
Should not all maths graduates be able to produce nicely formatted printed
maths, therefore should we teach TeX/LaTeX? Furthermore should mathematical
notation itself be part of the curriculum? However this is probably not an
issue for the numerous other disciplines that use maths.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Concluding comment</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:74.95pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Making mathematics fully accessible to a diversity
of people in online learning is not a solved problem. Nor are the options for

provide good support for MathML, and then sometimes only with difficulty. For
example, much blog and forum software does not support MathML, and neither does
email.</p>

<h2>Media support for translation of MathML to speech text</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:10.9pt'>So far as I know, the Internet
Explorer web browser together with the freely available MathPlayer plugin from
DesignScience is the only combination that supports translation of MathML to
speech text, for use by a screen reader.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:81.3pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>First, here is a confusing example of apparently
incorrect output. Given a lambda character as input, MathFlow (and presumably
MathPlayer) produces lamda as speech text. The JAWS screen reader speaks
lambda incorrectly. It voices the b. However, JAWS says for lamda what it
should say for lambda.</p>

6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Equations such as A = B = C, where A, B and C are
large expressions, are often formatted for display as a table with two columns.
MathML to speech text conversion, not knowing any better, reads the table
structure as well as the equation. Matrices have the same problem, and when the
entries are numbers the signal-to-noise ratio is quite low.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:84.8pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Similarly, a cases statement when formatted for
display is a table, and the translator will read it as a table rather than a
cases statement.</p>

17.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>When text, such as the price of bread, appears in

<h2 style='margin-left:90.25pt'>Introduction</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>The aim of this article is to reflect on and
promote discussion of accessibility of teaching university Mathematics. There
are a number of features of traditional Mathematics teaching that can
unintentionally inhibit the participation of some disabled students. I will
suggest a possible way to remove these barriers through the use of mindmaps and
teaching technologies.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:90.25pt'>Context and barriers</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:15.35pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Long sections of text seem to be the cause of
problems for many students with Asperger syndrome (AS) and dyslexia. Students
with AS report that they can focus better if the material is broken down,
otherwise they find that they can got lost half way through, lose their place
or fail to retain the required information [1]. Similarly for students with
dyslexia who report problems when reading mathematics when it is embedded in
large amounts of text [2]. Multistage problems in Mathematics can produce a similar
effect, with the end result typically being that the student only focuses on
one part and fails to answer the question as a whole [3]. Mindmaps (also called
tree diagrams) have been shown to help. Trott describes an example of where a
student with dyslexia had difficulty with partial differentiation. She
describes in [2] how the student got lost and often omitted derivatives. They
tried a mindmap and this helped the student identify the various aspects of the
problem as well as ways in which they interplay. This imposed an organization
to the students work which was previously lacking. Mindmapping allows the user
to view information in a way that is selective and make links between the
information to give the bigger picture. Mindmaps consist of a series of
branches which can contain a specific part of the methodology. Branches can
collapse at a glance to hide information so that the user can focus on a
particular part and the user can view one branch at a time, without having to
sift through large amounts of text.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:32.85pt;margin-bottom:
17.1pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Numerous lengthy, multistage problems and large
sections of text is a current feature of the Mathematics courses that I teach
and, for reasons outlined in [4], these may pose as unintentional barriers to
some disabled students.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:90.25pt'>Recommendations</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>Mindmapping may be a way of improving accessibility
and incorporating a degree of flexibility that will likely benefit all
students. Figure 1 (overleaf) illustrates an example of how a mindmap diagram
can help organise an extended piece of mathematics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>The work described in Figure 1 is a summary of the
eigenvalue/eigenfunction method for solving two-dimensional linear systems with
complex eigenvalues. Even the summary of this process is rather lengthy (Fig
1a, top panel). The mindmap equivalent (Fig 1b, bottom panel) provides a clear
structure without the distractions of the text, encouraging the student to
focus on the key steps before sinking into any detail. The branches of the
mindmap also work well as memory hooks and thus particularly important for
students with poor short-term memory.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.9pt;margin-bottom:
11.75pt;margin-left:90.25pt'>One possible way to construct these mindmaps is to
use the software package MindGenius. MindGenius combines technology and
mindmapping. It is flexible, in that any number of colours, text fonts and
sizes can be used, and it has the ability to fit into any environment, i.e.
exported directly into any number of formats e.g. Word, Powerpoint, PDF, HTML
without any </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:86.25pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>additional re-typing. MindGenius can be used
effectively for planning, organising notes and studying or remembering
information. It fits nicely with the needs of some dyslexic students, who
report to prefer to learn from a visual source [2], as well as students with
AS, who may find it difficult to structure their notes for revision purposes
[1]. Additionally, it is possible to attach sound (MP3) files to branches of
the map, which may be of great benefit for, for example, a person with dyslexia
or visual impairment to have lecture notes in an aural content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:89.85pt;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:11.85pt'>Another key advantage of using mindmapping is that
it facilitates a nonlinear presentation of the material. The traditional
teaching approach, along with the typical modularised course structure, goes a
long way in forcing a linear way of thinking in our students [5] and this
appears to be detrimental to many students, particular those with short term
memory problems, such as those with dyslexia and AS [3]. In my experience,
students generally struggle to apply prerequisite material and relate it to new
course material. In many cases, students lose interest or are unable to engage
when new material is taught that relies on previously taught techniques. One of
my students who is diagnosed with AS once told me that the material that I was
teaching was foreign to him, even though the student was simply being asked to
apply previously taught material, which I knew he had a strong grasp of, to a
new problem. The solution, in this instance, was to reteach the material to the
student in the framework of the new problem. Obviously, there is simply not
enough time to reteach everything and, even if there was, it would not be
beneficial to all students and could easily cloud the focus of what you are
actually trying to teach, i.e. the new material. However, I have found a
possible solution in the form of layers in the mindmap. The idea is that,
with a single click, the student can, if they need to, uncover the necessary
prerequisite material. For example, in Figure 1b, step-one in solving a </p>

typically I would just ask them to refer to that material. Now, I just tell
them to click box 1 to reveal the necessary method (as shown in Figure 2).</p>

remind themselves of the definition of a determinant by clicking the
highlighted text. This way the student can see the previously learnt material
in the context of the current problem and then, hopefully, it would appear less
foreign. The application of mindmaps in all of my teaching is still work in
progress but there are clear advantages in that they help signpost the key
points, provide easy access to prerequisite material, are, importantly,
transferable to a number of accessible formats which help remove some of the
barriers placed by the traditional university mathematics teaching approach

argument for the specific inclusion of mathematical reading and study skills
during the first year of a degree would appear to remain valid over twenty
years on. Particular attention is paid to the importance of reading skills and
it is noted that the skills required are different for mathematics texts.
Hence, by reference to the specialist nature of such skills tuition it is
concluded that this is likely to be the responsibility of the mathematics

considers common experiences of dyslexia and some of the neurological basis. West
goes on to profile eleven people, mostly well-known and considered remarkable
in their field including three physicists, two mathematicians and two
inventors. West argues that ten of the eleven show some form of pattern of
learning difficulties and all are seen as highly creative with most being
strong visual thinkers. He goes on to consider non-verbal thought, pattern,
creativity and thus mathematics in this context. </p>
