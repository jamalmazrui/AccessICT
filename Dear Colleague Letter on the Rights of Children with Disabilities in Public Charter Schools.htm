<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Students with disabilities who are enrolled in public
charter schools, like students with disabilities enrolled in other public
elementary or secondary schools, have important rights under two Federal laws,
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) and the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Similarly, students with disabilities
who seek to enroll in public charter schools or traditional public schools have
important rights secured by these two laws.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Today, we are pleased to issue two documents to provide the
charter school community with information about the rights of charter school
students with disabilities and prospective charter school students with
disabilities. These documents are “Frequently Asked Questions about the Rights
of Students with Disabilities in Public Charter Schools under Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,” issued by the United States Department of
Education’s (ED) Office for Civil Rights (OCR), <a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:20.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Section 504 prohibits entities that receive Federal
financial assistance from discriminating on the basis of disability, ensuring
that students with disabilities are provided an equal opportunity to
participate in or benefit from the aid, benefits, services, and opportunities
provided to others in federally-assisted programs. The Section 504 document
outlines the rights of charter school students with disabilities (and
prospective charter school students with disabilities) on a variety of issues,
including the right to a free appropriate public education (FAPE) as defined in
ED’s regulations implementing Section 504. A key message of the Section 504
document is that charter school students with disabilities have the same
Section 504 rights as other public school students with disabilities at the
elementary and secondary education levels. For this reason guidance applicable
to the Section 504 rights of public elementary and secondary school students

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>generally applies to charter school students regardless of
whether charter schools or charter school students are specifically mentioned.
In addition, the Section 504 document offers information about the
applicability of requirements for disability nondiscrimination and equal
opportunity in recruitment, application, and admission to charter schools
because the admissions policy or enrollment practices of a charter school may
differ from the admissions policy or enrollment practices of a traditional public
school or school district.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The IDEA is the Federal law that assists States, and
through them, local educational agencies in providing special education and
related services to children with disabilities. The primary purpose of the IDEA
Part B program is for States and school districts to make FAPE, as defined in
IDEA, available to all eligible children with disabilities and to ensure that
IDEA’s rights and protections are afforded to those children and their parents.
The IDEA document outlines the rights of charter school students with
disabilities and their parents on a variety of issues. Specifically, the IDEA
document emphasizes that children with disabilities who attend charter schools
and their parents retain all rights and protections under Part B of IDEA just
as they would at other public schools. It also addresses the provision of FAPE,
the State educational agency's general supervisory authority over all
educational programs for children with disabilities in the State, including
charter schools, child find and evaluations, placement, procedural safeguards,
IDEA funding, IDEA obligations related to charter school closures, and other
topics. The IDEA document is part of multiple technical assistance and related
efforts by OSERS in support of the important role that State educational
agencies play in ensuring that all educational programs for children with
disabilities in the State meet State education standards and the requirements
of Part B of the IDEA.  </p>

Federal law, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Title
II), prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public entities
regardless of whether they receive Federal financial assistance. Violations of
Section 504 that result from a public entity’s failure to meet the obligations
identified in the Section 504 document also generally would constitute
violations of Title II. To the extent that Title II provides greater protection
than Section 504, entities covered by Title II must comply with Title II’s
substantive requirements. For additional information on Title II, see <a
