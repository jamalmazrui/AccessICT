Introduction
Microsoft OneNote is a versatile digital notebook that helps users capture, organize, and share information. This guide focuses on accessibility features, emphasizing screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation. The content spans four detailed sessions, covering both desktop and mobile usage, including the integration of Copilot for enhanced productivity.
Section 1: Overview of OneNote Layout for Screen Reader Users
Understanding OneNote's layout can be easier when you think of it as a digital version of a physical notebook system. Let's break this down using familiar objects to help conceptualize how the structure works:
The Main Layout
Imagine you're sitting at a desk with multiple notebooks, each filled with dividers and pages. The OneNote interface is like that desk, where each area has a specific role:
• Notebook Pane: Think of a shelf holding all your notebooks. This is where you choose which notebook to work with.
• Section Tabs: When you open a notebook, you'll see colored dividers sticking out. These represent sections.
• Page List: Each divider has pages behind it, which you can flip through. These are your individual pages in OneNote.
• Content Area: When you're on a specific page, this is the flat surface of your desk where you can write notes, paste pictures, or attach items.
Notebooks
Notebooks in OneNote are like actual physical notebooks you'd use for different subjects or projects. For example:
• You might have one notebook labeled "Work Projects" and another for "Personal Ideas."
• Each notebook is its own separate file and holds all the related sections and pages for that topic.
Sections
Sections are the dividers within a notebook. Think of the brightly colored plastic or paper tabs you use to separate content:
• For example, in your "Work Projects" notebook, you might have sections labeled "Meetings," "Research," and "Deadlines."
• These dividers help you group similar types of information in one place, making it easier to find.
Pages
Pages are the actual sheets of paper within a section.
• When you go to the "Meetings" section, you can flip through pages for each meeting you've had-just like flipping through a paper notebook to find your handwritten notes.
• Each page is a blank canvas where you can write notes, paste images, or create tables.
Content Blocks
Here's where OneNote differs from a physical notebook: instead of fixed lines or sections on a page, it's more like having sticky notes or movable content cards.
• Each content block is like a sticky note, index card, or taped-in photo. You can move these around on the page wherever you want.
• One block might hold a to-do list, while another contains a picture, and yet another has text notes from a meeting.
Additional Features
• Search: Imagine having a digital assistant who can instantly find a specific note, section, or phrase across all your notebooks, saving you from flipping through every page.
• Tagging: This is like putting colorful Post-it flags on your pages for easy reference. For example, you might use a red flag for urgent tasks or a green one for completed items.
• Synchronization: Think of all your notebooks being magically duplicated on every device you own, so you can grab the right one no matter where you are.
Accessibility Impacts
For screen reader users, understanding this structure (notebook > section > page > content block) is like knowing how your desk is organized in the real world. Clear labels on sections and pages act like written titles on your notebook tabs, making it easier to navigate. Arranging content blocks in a logical order is like keeping your notes tidy and readable, so you can quickly find what you need.
Bringing It All Together
OneNote is like a digital desk filled with notebooks, dividers, and sticky notes. Knowing how everything is organized helps you navigate confidently, just like keeping your physical desk orderly makes finding and using your materials easier.
Session 2: Navigating and Organizing in OneNote
Introduction to OneNote
Think of OneNote as a digital filing cabinet. Each notebook is a drawer, sections are folders within the drawer, and pages are individual documents inside the folders. This structure ensures you always know where to find your notes.

What are Content Blocks in OneNote?
Content blocks are the core building units of a OneNote page, enabling the addition and organization of different types of content, such as text, images, tables, and multimedia. They are designed to be flexible, allowing users to create, move, and customize content. This guide highlights how screen reader users and keyboard-only users can interact with content blocks effectively.
Types of Content Blocks
1. Text Blocks
- Add and format text with headings, bullet points, or numbered lists.
- Supports rich text formatting (e.g., bold, italics, underline).
2. Image Blocks
- Insert images with support for resizing and annotation.
- Add descriptive alt text for screen readers to improve accessibility.
3. Table Blocks
- Create tables to organize data.
- Use accessible table structures by ensuring headers are defined.
4. Multimedia Blocks
- Embed audio or video files that can be played back directly within OneNote.
- Include captions or transcripts for multimedia content when possible.
5. File Attachment Blocks
- Attach external files (e.g., PDFs, Word documents) for easy access.
- Label the attachments descriptively for clarity.
6. Ink Blocks
- Use digital drawing tools for handwriting or annotations.
- Provide text equivalents for handwritten content where feasible.
7. Link Blocks
- Add hyperlinks to other pages, sections, or external resources.
- Use descriptive link text (e.g., "Meeting Notes - March" instead of "Click here").
Navigating Content Blocks with a Keyboard
1. Create a Content Block:
- Use the Tab key or arrow keys to navigate to an empty space on the page.
- Press Enter to activate the block and start typing for a text block.
2. Move Between Content Blocks:

5. Select and Group Blocks:
- Navigate to a block and press Ctrl + Space to select it.
- Select multiple blocks with Shift + Arrow Keys, then group them by pressing Ctrl + G.
Using Screen Readers with Content Blocks
1. Identifying Blocks:
- Screen readers announce the type of block (e.g., "Text block" or "Table block") when it gains focus.
- Ensure descriptive titles or alt text are added to content for clarity.
2. Navigating Blocks:
- Use screen reader navigation commands (e.g., Down Arrow or Tab) to move through blocks sequentially.
- Use block-specific commands (e.g., Insert + F7 in JAWS to list links) for quick access.
3. Editing Content:
- Focus on a block and press Enter to enter edit mode.
- For tables, use arrow keys to navigate cells and ensure headers are defined for proper screen reader navigation.
4. Annotating Images:
- After inserting an image, add alt text by selecting the image, pressing Shift + F10 (Windows) or Control + Option + Space (Mac), and choosing "Alt Text" from the context menu.
5. Playing Multimedia:
- Navigate to a multimedia block and press Enter to play.
- Use keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Spacebar to pause/resume) for playback control.
Best Practices for Accessible Content Blocks
1. Organize Information Logically:
- Arrange blocks in a linear, easy-to-navigate order.
- Avoid overlapping blocks, which can confuse screen readers.
2. Add Descriptive Information:
- Use clear titles, alt text, and captions for all content.
- Ensure hyperlinks have meaningful text descriptions.
3. Use Accessible Table Structures:
- Mark table headers and avoid using tables solely for layout purposes.
4. Test with Screen Readers:
- Regularly review notes with screen readers to ensure all content is accessible.
