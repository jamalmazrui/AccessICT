1 Overview “PAC – PDF Accessibility Checker”

1  Overview “PAC – PDF Accessibility Checker”

Congratulations on using “PAC: PDF Accessibility Checker”. You have chosen an evaluation tool which will support you when creating high quality accessible PDF documents and PDF forms and which will make your work much easier.

1.1  Tagged PDF documents

Tags are the foundation of accessible PDF documents. They deliver the structural information, which enables assistive technology, such as screen readers, to

•          Properly recognise different text elements, such as headings, lists, graphics and tables.

•          Read the document following the correct reading order.

Many authoring systems are capable of producing tagged PDF documents. Unfortunately, however, the quality of those automatically generated tagged documents is often insufficient, which makes additional visual as well as technical checks inevitable. 1.2  Checking PDF-Accessibility using PAC

3  Accessibility Checks

3.1  Check 1: Document is marked as tagged

This check evaluates if the document is marked as containing tags.

This is necessary because some viewers and screen readers don't recognise tags within a PDF document unless it specifically contains this flag.

  ------------------ --------------------------
  WCAG 2.0           Principle 1: Perceivable
  ISO 32000-1:2008   Table 321, Key 'Marked'
  ------------------ --------------------------

3.2  Check 2: Document Title available

This check evaluates if a title has been set for the PDF document.

  ------------------ ---------------------------------
  WCAG 2.0           Principle 1: Perceivable
  ISO 32000-1:2008   Table 22, Bit-Position 5 und 10
  ------------------ ---------------------------------

A title helps the user to gain better orientation.

+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| WCAG 2.0                          | Principle 2: Operable                |

+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

3.3  Check 3: Document Language defined

This check evaluates if a language has been assigned to the PDF document.

This is necessary for screen readers to use the correct pronunciation when reading the PDF document.

+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| WCAG 2.0                          | Principle 3: Understandable               |
|                                   |                                           |
|                                   | Guideline 3.1: Readable                   |
|                                   |                                           |
|                                   | Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| ISO 32000-1:2008                  | Table 28, Key 'Lang'                      |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

3.4  Check 4: Accessible Security Settings

This check evaluates if the security settings of the PDF document allow assistive technology to access the tag structure.

If the security settings of a PDF document are too restrictive, assistive technology can't access the document anymore and thus are useless.

3.5  Check 5: Tab follows Tag-Structure

This check evaluates if all pages of the PDF document are configured so that when using the Tab key, the performed jumps follow the tag structure.

This ensures that the user, when sequentially navigating through the document using the Tab key, will get the information consistently in the same order as they're defined in the document structure.

+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| WCAG 2.0                          | Principle 2: Operable                |
|                                   |                                      |

+-----------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

3.6  Check 6: Consistent Heading Structure

This check evaluates the structure of the document. The following three cases will produce a warning:

•          if the document has no assigned headings

•          if the structure of the document does not begin with heading level 1

•          if heading levels are skipped over in the document structure

A consistent structure helps the user to navigate through the document more specifically. Also, an inconsistent structure may confuse assistive technology, presenting an illogical hierarchy of headings to the user.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

3.7  Check 7: Bookmarks available

This check evaluates if the document contains bookmarks.

Bookmarks provide the user with an easier way to navigate the document.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| WCAG 2.0                          | Principle 2: Operable             |

| ISO 32000-1:2008                  | Table 28, Key 'Outlines'          |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

3.8  Check 8: Accessible Font Encodings

This check evaluates if all font characters within tagged text blocks can be converted into distinct Unicode characters.

In PDF documents, fonts can use a variety of encodings. As for assistive technologies, the used fonts are of no relevance, they are not familiar with the various encodings. Therefore, Adobe Reader / Adobe Acrobat converts all font characters into the Unicode system before passing them to the assistive technology. If a translation table is missing for a certain font, non-interpretable characters are passed to the assistive technology.

  ------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------
  WCAG 2.0           Principle 1: Perceivable
  ISO 32000-1:2008   Section 9.10.2: Mapping Character Codes to Unicode Values
  ------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------

3.9  Check 9: Content completely tagged

This check evaluates if all contents of the PDF document are tagged. Contents which specifically have been set as background (and thus won't be interpreted or read by a screen reader) are also accepted as tagged content.

Not tagged content are not or wrongly interpreted by assistive technologies. Therefore, all content has to be tagged.

  ------------------ --------------------------
  WCAG 2.0           Principle 1: Perceivable
  ISO 32000-1:2008   Section 14.8: Tagged PDF
  ------------------ --------------------------

3.10  Check 10: Logical Reading Order

This check evaluates the logic of the PDF document's reading order and warns when possible errors are detected. Not every warning, however, necessarily means that there's really an error.

The logical reading order defines the sequence in which the content of the document is passed to the assistive technologies. If set incorrectly, a screen reader will read the text in the wrong order.

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| WCAG 2.0                          | Principle 1: Perceivable                     |

+-----------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+

3.11  Check 11: Alternative Text available

This check evaluates if all tagged non-text elements contain an alternative text.

In order for non-text contents, such as graphics, to be perceived by the blind, an alternative text containing an appropriate description has to be made available.

+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| WCAG 2.0                          | Principle 1: Perceivable                  |

+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------+

3.12  Check 12: Correct Syntax Tags / Rolls

This check evaluates if all tags and rolls within the PDF document correspond to the ISO standard and if they have been used correctly.

Assistive technologies follow the defined ISO standards. The tag structure, therefore, can only be interpreted correctly if those standards are being followed.

3.13  Check 13: Sufficient contrast for Text

This check evaluates if the visual presentation of tagged text has a sufficient contrast ratio according to the WCAG 2.0 standard.

Due to the high complexity of colour value calculations transparency, shadings, patterns and soft masks are currently excluded from this check. Only the ICC profile sRGB is completely supported. For all other ICC profiles, the alternative colour space is used.

Principle 1: Perceivable

Success Criterion 1.4.3: Contrast (Minimum)

3.14  Check 14: Spaces existent

This check evaluates if the visual spaces in a PDF document are also contained within the content and the tag tree.

Some PDF Generators think it not necessary to include invisible spaces to be passed into the PDF document. For assistive technologies, however, those spaces are inevitable.
