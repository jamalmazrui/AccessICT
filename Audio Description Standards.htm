margin-left:.5pt'>Description Project chaired by ACB’s Vice President Kim
Charlson.  The word “gathered” is used as the work is here is not, by and
large, new:  it is a “review of the literature,” a culling of material that
exists in documents that are widely available.  Generally, those documents are
not the result of scientific research.  But they reflect and in turn these
standards are based on many years of experience with audio description in a
wide range of contexts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:1.35pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>The Standards are intended to be overarching in nature, i.e.,
they are written to apply to audio description generally no matter the
particular format in which it is used.  There are, of course, significant
distinctions that arise as describers work within media as opposed to
developing a tour for a museum exhibition.  Consequently, we have developed
sub-sets of these standards that focus on Performing Arts, Media, and Visual </p>

Maryland State Council of the Blind; and Joel Snyder, Director, Audio

interested via a wikidot.org page. The committee will monitor and review all
contributions and a new version will be presented to the Audio Description
Project Conference in Orlando, Florida, July 6-8, 2009.  In addition,
consideration Conference time will be allocated for further review of the
Standards sub-sets on Media, Performing Arts, and Visual Art/Exhibitions. </p>

<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:36.3pt;line-height:111%'><u>The Audio
Description User – Who Are “The Blind”?</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:11.25pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>They are <i>not </i>&quot;the blind.&quot;  They are
individuals --  housewives, scientists, artists, business people ... maybe you
or me, sometime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:11.3pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>They are unique individuals with a living with some degree of
vision loss as the result of a wide range of causes.  Most users of description
are not totally blind; indeed, only 12% of the legally blind are congenitally
blind (blind from birth); others are adventitiously blind or developed total
blindness later in life.  Most at one point had all or some of their sight and
now they may have only peripheral vision, they may see only shapes, light and
dark, colors, movement, shadows, blurs, or “blobs” -- or have &quot;tunnel
vision.&quot;  Only 10% know Braille.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:11.3pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>The American Foundation for the Blind reports that 21.2
million Americans have vision loss. While description was developed for people
who are blind or visually impaired, many others may also benefit from
description’s concise, objective “translation” of the key visual components of
various art genres and social settings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-right:.3pt'>Audio Description is an “Assistive
Technology”; it is meant to enhance, not replace the user’s own powers of
observation.</p>

with words all that is seen with the eye.  Description, then, becomes an
exercise in what <i>not </i>to describe.  We leave out far more than we

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:11.4pt;

i.e., people with varying degrees of vision loss from description enthusiasts
who are congenitally blind to those who have a relatively modest level of low
vision. Indeed, the percentage of people in our audiences who have never had
any useful sight is quite small.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:15.25pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>Thus, to a certain extent the describer’s choices of what to

a context, then move to details to enhance understanding and appreciation.
Provide <u>visual perspective </u>as appropriate and as time allows. The
initial information presented about a scene will create a foundation in the
minds of the audience members;</p>

</span><u>use of color</u>—the ITC Standards explain:  “Most visually impaired
people have at some time seen colours and either retained the visual memory of
colour or can remember the significance and impact of a particular colour.  …
People who are blind from birth or from an early age cannot ‘see’ colours but
they do understand the significance of a particular colour by its association. 
They may not ‘see’ green, but the colour of flower stalks, leaves and grass,
which people can touch and smell does mean something.”  When asked about the
perception of color, a congenitally blind audio description user in Oregon

For instance, the first describer describes the performance while the second

</span>Some performing arts description producers will have a describer preview
a performance (as production schedules allow) enough times to allow for the
development of a description script.  Others depend on one or two previews
where notes are made and the describer provides description in a more
“extemporaneous” manner.  If time and schedules allow, the development of a
script permits the careful consideration of the various fundamentals of
description outlined earlier in this document.  The describer using a script
does not, of course, read the script without looking at the live performance;
he/she must know the script well enough to use the script as a prompt and be
free to describe extemporaneously when “change happens.”  </p>

</span>Typically, audio description is offered at one to three performances
throughout the run of an extended series of performances, often one evening
performance and one matinee.  This, of course, limits the AD users in their
flexibility in scheduling attendance at performing arts events.  Some
organizations ask for advance notice of two weeks or more in order to provide
AD as a special request.  In an effort to put the AD user on a par with any
other performing arts patron, certain producers will “cast” a describer who can
attend selected rehearsals, develop an AD script and be available at every
performance (similar to an understudy).  If no desires the service, the
describer is free to go.  </p>

</span>The purpose of pre-show notes is to prepare the patron by including
descriptions that the describer will not have time to give during the
performance. In addition to the credits on the playbill, the pre-show notes
cover descriptions of the sets, with their entrances, exits, levels, placement
of furniture, etc.; the physical characteristics of the characters, the roles
they play, their costumes, any gestures or mannerisms they use repeatedly;
dance movement; recurring staging techniques; and any props that are
significant. Because time permits, all these descriptions should be complete
and detailed, tightly organized and not exceed 10–15 minutes.  Most describers
prepare scripted pre-show notes to be sure that they’re covering everything in
a coherent, organized and timely manner. Productions with intermissions provide
a second opportunity to provide additional information. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The pre-show notes are also the place to define any terminology that
might be used in the performance. In a period piece, terms of clothing or
architecture might be explained. Unusual props can be defined. The remaining
time before the curtain can be filled with the director’s notes, articles about
the playwright, the actors’ biographies, the appearance of the audience, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>Note: Listeners are trying to absorb and remember a great
deal of verbal information. Describe settings and costumes in the order they
appear. As much as possible, describe each setting in the same order (left to
right and top to bottom, for example). When many of the characters wear
costumes that are variations of the same style, it’s helpful to establish the
basic style of the male and female costumes (“most of the men wear three-piece
suits, white shirts and string ties while the women’s dresses are highnecked,
long-sleeved and have straight skirts to the floor”) and then describe the
specifics for each costume.</p>

</span>If the play has a complex plot and/or a confusing set of characters,
there may be a synopsis in the playbill. Just as this information is helpful to
sighted audience members, sharing this information with listeners during
pre-show notes may aid their appreciation of the performance and the
description. Make clear that the information comes from the program so
listeners understand that everyone has access to this information—that the
describer is not providing special information because the listener may have
trouble following the material.  For example, if a character wears bustles, the
term will arise in describing the costumes. To confirm that everyone knows what
a “bustle” is, tuck this into the pre-show notes without calling attention to
it, with something like, “The women’s long skirts puff out in back, padded over
the hips and under their skirts, with bustles.” If it’s important to the plot,
try to repeat the information during the description for those who didn’t hear
the pre-show notes.</p>

</span>If there’s a delay in the start of the performance or during a scene
change or an emergency in the audience, describe what the sighted audience can
see—a large group has just arrived and is being seated, the curtain is caught
on a piece of scenery, etc. Remember the rule of “say what you see”—don’t
report something you hear on the backstage intercom, etc. If it’s not apparent
why there’s a delay, it’s fine to say so and that reassures listeners that the
describer is still there.</p>

</span>In productions with intermissions and a great deal of information to
cover in pre-show notes, consider limiting the pre-show notes to overall
production information (credits, etc.) and the first act’s details (settings,
costumes, characters, etc.). Then, return during the final minutes of
intermission with notes to describe the second act’s details, important
reminders from the pre-show notes, and, if time allows, share additional
information from the playbill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>Note: At the end of the pre-show notes and at the end of
the first act, tell listeners that during intermission what you will share with
them so they may decide if they want to return in time to hear that
information. Assuming that some of the listeners will not hear the full
intermission notes, repeat the essential information during the second act
whenever possible.  If the new information for the second act is very brief,
listeners may appreciate its inclusion at the end of the pre-show notes or while
the house lights are dimming for the second act so they won’t have to shorten
their intermission activities to return for the second set of notes.  Don’t
assume that all listeners have heard the preshow notes or that all remember
everything they heard. As time allows, repeat the essential information as part
of the description during the performance. “Stepping On Lines”:</p>

</span>Descriptions are usually delivered during pauses between lines of
dialogue or quiet moments, avoiding other critical sound elements. But since it
is more <u>important to make</u> <u>a production understandable </u>than to
preserve every detail of the original soundtrack, the describer will speak over
dialogue and other audio when necessary. In most instances, a describer may
talk over background music or underscoring as well as the lyrics of a repeated
chorus of a song.</p>

margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>And, as noted earlier, it is appropriate to let pauses or quiet moments
pass without a description. Listeners want to hear the performance first and
the description second. The dialogue, the sounds—and even the silences—are
telling the story and must be experienced. </p>

character, the describer could match the character’s name with the actor’s
voice by mentioning the character’s name just before s/he speaks. Although the
describer usually doesn’t need to repeat the voice identification, this might
be necessary after a character has been silent or absent for a long time or if
several voices are similar and it’s important to know exactly who is saying

more specific vocabulary for describing movement.  There is a significant
difference between saying <u>what </u>someone is doing and describing <u>how </u>they
do it.  Description is often about <u>what </u>a mover is doing.  But to convey
as much information in as few words as possible, they often need to describe <u>how
</u>the mover is accomplishing the action.  What sort of pathway in space does
the mover follow?  How does the shape or “attitude” of their body convey
character or context?  What dynamic qualities of the movement flavor its
meaning?  The describer needs to choose concise wording that will capture the
primary elements, communicating to the listener the most essential visual cues.

impossible to outline the content of a dance in words, although one can always
describe the movement.  …  the artist playing the role of Eve can pluck the
apple in more than one way, with movements of varying expression.  She can
pluck the apple greedily and rapidly or languidly and sensuously. … Many other
forms of action are possible, and each of these will be characterized by a
different kind of movement. …  In defining the kind of movement as greedy, as
sensuous, or detached, one does not define merely what one has actually seen.

margin-left:9.85pt'>A blind AD user once commented, “I never go to dance
because all I get is the music, and if I don’t like the music, it’s really
boring!”  When asked what he would need to hear in the description in order not
to be bored, he replied, “the story”.  Of course, in the case of modern dance
often the images are abstract—there is no story!”  With dance description, it’s
important to find the “story” it tells: what main idea does the dancing
communicate to the viewer, what is the essence of the dance?  What information
would be most important to allow a blind audience member to experience the
performance as fully as possible, to help him follow the meaning of the
choreography?  Which elements comprised the structure and themes of the
choreography, and what words would most succinctly convey those ideas?</p>

margin-left:9.85pt'>For example, one piece might be mostly “about” spatial
patterns and sequences of group clustering and scattering; the dancers’
specific movements may be less important, and their individual characteristics
(gender, hair color, body shape, etc.) may not matter at all with respect to
the content being expressed. In another piece, where each dancer plays a unique
character, those particulars, along with various movement combinations and body
attitude, can be meaningful factors.</p>

one of Axis Dance Company’s pieces: “Dust”, choreographed by Victoria Marks. 
The script is designed to be spoken while the movement occurs; viewing a tape
of the piece, you would notice that much has been left unsaid in order to focus
on communicating mood, theme and choreographic structure, while leaving aural
space for the impact of the musical score.  We invite you to test the

</span>When describing certain passages of time, such as flashbacks or dream
sequences, describe the visual cues that let the audience know there is a
flashback.  For younger audiences, it is sometime impractical to use describing
conventions that one might use for adults. In some cases, it is necessary to
explicitly tell the audience what is happening rather than describing the
action (e.g., flashback or dream sequence).</p>

</span>Sometimes a describer will describe what’s about to appear because
there’s no silence for the information when it does appear. For instance, the
audio description of what’s currently occurring and the current background
noise may indicate that a waterfall; the describer may need to say “In a
moment, a NASCAR racetrack with a dozen cars circling the track.” This alerts
viewers with low vision that the racetrack isn’t onscreen at present.</p>

</span>Occasionally there’s no silent opportunity to describe something
essential to listeners’ understanding while that specific visual image is on
the screen. The describer may need to omit a less significant description of
what’s onscreen in order to interject the critical description.</p>

</span>Utilizing the same character names and/or vocabulary throughout a
production or series of productions is essential.  For instance, on a longer
production, often more than one description writer will work on its description
script.  It’s critical that the draft final script is reviewed in its totality
for consistency.  </p>

</span>Occasionally, the audience is directly engaged, particularly with
children’s material or educational productions. An on-screen character might
ask the audience to “Watch me and follow along,” or an instructor might ask,
“Can you see what color the liquid is turning in the beaker?” In such cases, it
is important for the audience members to know that it is they who are being
addressed (as opposed to an on-screen character). One way to accomplish this is
to refer to the audience as “you.”</p>

In addition, the describer should read text and subtitles.  Generally, on first
appearance, text or subtitles can be introduced with a phrase such as, “Words

draw a distinction between description of on-screen action and the reading of
text or subtitles.</p>

margin-left:9.85pt'>Note:  Much of the material in this section is adapted from
guidelines posted at <u><span style='color:blue'>www.artbeyondsight.org </span></u>and
Art Education for the Blind’s (AEB) landmark 1996 publication  <i>Making Visual
Art Accessible to People Who Are Blind and Visually Impaired.  </i>AEB refers
to audio description for visual art as “verbal description.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>Definition:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- Verbal description uses nonvisual language to convey the
visual world.   In a museum or at an exhibition of any sort, a verbal
description includes standard information included on a label, such as the name
of the artist, nationality, title of the artwork, date, dimensions or scale of
the work, media and technique. More important, verbal description includes a
description of the work.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Museum Tours</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- Verbal description as part of a touch tour enhances the
visitor’s tactile experience. It can also provide access to a museum’s
collection when the works of art are not available to touch. When a group of
visitors includes blind, visually impaired, and sighted visitors, museum
professionals or docents can incorporate in-depth verbal description into their
regular tour. If a classroom teacher conducts the tour, it is advisable for
educators to visit the museum or historical site first to prepare the verbal description.
</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Audio Guides</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- Some museums create an additional audio guide for blind
and visually impaired visitors or include extensive verbal description of
artworks in their standard audio guide. Sighted museum visitors report that
they benefit from this practice as well.  Following a “universal design”
concept, exhibit designers are increasingly combining standard audio tours with
audio descriptions, an “all-in-one” concept.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Classroom Lessons / Literacy</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Verbal description and discussion about the work of art can be a part of
a class that precedes or follows a museum visit. Teachers can incorporate
verbal description of art, architecture, and design objects into history,
social science, math, and other classes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>Precise and organized description is one of the basic tools
of effective communication. It can improve students’ awareness of their
environment and enrich their vocabulary.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This notion represents a relatively new application for audio
description:  as an aid to literacy.  As you might imagine, some “picture
books” for toddlers are deficient with respect to the language skills they
involve—they rely on the pictures to tell the story.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>But the teacher trained in audio description techniques
would never simply hold up a picture of a ball and read the text:  &quot;See
the ball.&quot;  He or she might add:  &quot;The ball is red--just like a fire
engine.  I think that ball is as large as one of you!  It's as round as the
sun--a bright red circle or sphere.&quot;  The teacher has introduced new
vocabulary, invited comparisons, and used metaphor or simile--with toddlers! 
By using description, these books (or children’s videos) are made accessible to
kids who have low vision or are blind and simultaneously all kids develop more
sophisticated language skills.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Numerous studies have shown the value of captions to children in the
development of literacy.  In a similar vein, a comparable benefit might be
observed in children exposed to audio description.  Description—with its focus
on observation, clarity, and efficiency of language use—can build more
sophisticated literacy in children who are blind, who have low vision and in
*all* children.   </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Multisensory Books</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- Multisensory art books created for people who are blind
or have limited sight integrate verbal description, high-resolution
reproductions of the images, a tactile component, and sometimes an audio
component.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>Practical Considerations:</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>For Educator or Docent-Led Tours</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Verbal description is used throughout an exhibition to describe
displays, to respond to particular questions, and to encourage dialogue. The
pace and level of detail of description can be adapted to individuals based on
their degree of sight loss and their prior experience making art or looking at
art.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When planning a tour, keep in mind that verbal description adds time.
Therefore, fewer works may be included on a tour. A general rule of thumb is to
use half the number of works you would use in a tour without verbal
description. So it's important to carefully select the works for your tour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Develop verbal description scripts for the objects on your tour and
review them with visually impaired advisors for effective language, clarity and
length of the descriptions, and appropriate pace of the tour. Verbal
description is also an essential part of a touch tour or a tour that includes
tactile diagrams or tactile elements. As verbal description skills increase,
these scripts will serve as guidelines, rather than as a text to be memorized.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When first meeting a group that includes people who are blind or
visually impaired, briefly describe the lobby or meeting space. Then, so that
you may adjust your tour to your visitors needs, find out more about the type
and degree of visual impairment. As with all audiences, try to relate the
individual's life experiences to the content in the work of art. Throughout
your tour, include brief descriptions of gallery spaces through which you pass
and museum architecture. You might include the size of the space, type of art,
or other general information about the atmosphere or ambiance of the museum.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It is important to keep verbal description separate from information
about the historical context. If your tour includes both sighted and visually
impaired people, present your verbal description first. This creates equal
opportunity for further discussion of historical context, biography of the
artist, or other information important for all audiences to understand the
work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One strategy frequently used during school-aged group tours could be
used with all groups: elicit audience response through directed questioning. If
you have an integrated class, with both sighted and visually impaired students,
include everyone in the verbaldescription process. Ask sighted students to
describe elements in the work through directed questioning. This creates an
engaging atmosphere and strengthens observation skills. At the end of each
description, restate student responses and summarize observations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Get feedback. After the description of the first work, ask one of the
tour participants if the description is meeting their needs or if you need to
make any adjustments. At the end of a tour for people with visual impairments,
take the opportunity to emphasize the organization’s accessibility features and
programming. Create a sense of welcome and encourage a future relationship with
the organization. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>For Audio Guides or Audio-described Self-guided
Tours</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Once you have developed verbal-description scripts, adapt them to create
an audio guide that all visitors can use in the galleries independently. For
the user with visual impairments, incorporate verbal description with
navigational and orientation cues. When designing a tour, consider the effect
of frequent physical changes in the galleries, such as chairs that are moved,
deinstallations, or construction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Museum staff who distribute audio guides to visitors should provide a
short orientation on how to use the player and guide.   The player should have
some type of neck strap so that a user has both hands free to use the buttons,
hold a tactile, or use a cane or other assistive device.</p>

margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Depending on the needs and resources of a particular organization,
delivery mechanisms will vary.  Some choices include:  audio cassette, CD,
digital wands, or concealed triggering mechanisms.  The last three mechanisms
are digital methods that allow for layers of description and the option to
choose between various exhibits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Generally, visually impaired visitors need orientation and navigational
information that can be incorporated throughout the described tour.  Some tours
will keep this information on a separate track or layer of the tour allowing
the sighted user to skip such information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Using infrared or FM systems (similar to those used in a performing arts

of a program, lecture, video, or performance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>Creating the Descriptions:</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Subject, Form, and Color</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- The basic object-label information is followed by a
general overview of the subject matter and composition of the work. Generally,
a coherent description should provide visual information in a sequence,
allowing a blind person to assemble, piece by piece, an image of a highly
complex work. First describe the explicit subject, that is, what is represented
in the work. For example, &quot;This painting features a recycled Savarin
coffee can filled with about eighteen paintbrushes.&quot; Next describe the
composition and give an overall impression of the work. With respect to works
of art, include in this description the color tones and the mood or atmosphere.
Many people who have lost their sight have a visual memory of colors. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Orient the Viewer with Directions<span
style='text-decoration:none'> </span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- Specific and concrete information is required to indicate
the location of objects or figures in a work of art. A useful directional
method is to refer to the positions of the numbers on a clock. Most blind
people are familiar with this method of providing direction. For example, in
referring to a person's face, you would describe the mouth as being at six
o'clock.   Also, when describing a figure depicted in a work of art, remember
that the image is the equivalent of a mirror image. Right and left can be very
ambiguous terms unless they are qualified. Accordingly, you should describe the
figure according to its right or left, and always qualify this description.
Refer to the viewer's orientation to right and left, as well. For example,
&quot;The woman's right hand, which is on your left, holds a small
goblet.&quot; </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Focus on the Style</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- The style of a work of art refers to the features that
identify a work as being by a particular artist or school, or of a movement,
period, or geographical region. Style is the cumulative result of many
characteristics, including brushwork, use of tone and color, choice of
different motifs, and the treatment of the subject. After the basic information
about subject, composition, and mediums are conveyed, the verbal description
can focus on how these many elements contribute to the whole. In a tour that includes
several works of art, comparisons are an effective way of making stylistic
features tangible.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>General to the Specific</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- Clear and precise language is crucial to any good
description. After the general idea of the work is conveyed, the description
should be more vivid and particularized. Describe pertinent details, and focus
on different parts of the work. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Art Conventions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- Art terms and pictorial conventions such as perspective,
focal point, picture plane, foreground, and background should always be defined
for your audience. Typically, it is useful to introduce the definition or
concept when the discussion turns to that aspect of the work of art.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>For example:  “The scene shows Christ and Peter placed in
the center foreground, with disciples and contemporary citizens arranged in
rows on either side of them. Perugino directs the spectator to focus on the
heart of the painting: the transferring of the keys. Perugino does this by
exploiting the pictorial convention of one-point perspective. Let's recall the
definition of one-point perspective, a way of projecting an illusion of the
threedimensional world onto a two-dimensional surface. All parallel lines
appear to converge at a single point on the horizon, called the vanishing
point. Jesus is presenting the large gold key to the kneeling Peter. In the
space between the two figures, a silver key hangs from the same chain at the
very center of the composition. The perspective lines of the pavement,
comprising the brickwork design, lead the spectator's eyes into the distance,
converging at the door of the centrally placed temple.” -Fredericka Foster
Shapiro, <i>Fifteenth-Century Italian Art</i></p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Indicate Where the Curators Have Installed a
Work<span style='text-decoration:none'> </span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- Generally, a work's placement in an institution reveals
important information about its meaning, as well as its relationship to other
works in the collection. Tell the AD user where the work is located in the
institution. Include in your discussion a description of the gallery or
sculpture garden where the work is installed, and mention the surrounding
artworks. Describe how the work under discussion relates to these other works,
as well as to the viewer and the surrounding space. For example, the work may
confront the viewer or it may be installed off to the side. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Refer to Other Senses as Analogues for Vision<span
style='text-decoration:none'> </span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>Try to translate a visual experience into another sense.
Other senses, such as touch or hearing, enable AD users to further construct
highly detailed impressions of a work on display. For instance, refer to the
sense of touch when describing the surface of a sculpture. A comparison between
the rough-hewn texture of Auguste Rodin's <i>Balzac </i>(1892-97) and the
glasslike finish of Constantin Brancusi's <i>Bird in Space </i>(c. 1927) can be
very instructive. Or compare a Japanese tea-ceremony jar, with its irregular
shape and unfinished surface, with a highly refined Chinese white-porcelain
statuette from the eighteenth century. In both of these ceramic works, the
degree of surface refinement is an integral part of the work's formal value, as
well as of its meaning. </p>

hearing to experience the grandeur and sensual richness of Annibale Carracci's

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:9.85pt'>“Imagine being in a very large room with superb sound
speakers placed just below the ceiling. The sound from the speakers is exactly
what you might hear in a garden. Imagine hearing plants rustling in the wind,
birds singing, and the splashing water of the fountains. In addition to these
natural sounds, you hear snatches of conversations and the cheerful laughter of
children playing. Imagine these sounds coming from many different directions.”</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Explain Concepts with Analogies<span
style='text-decoration:none'> </span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- Certain kinds of visual phenomena, such as shadows or
clouds, may be best described with a well-chosen analogy. To construct a
helpful analogy, choose objects or experiences from everyone's common
experience. In a description of Pablo Picasso's <i>Cubist painting Girl with a
Mandolin (Fanny Tellier) </i>(1910), you might compare the image of the figure
to a shattered wine bottle whose fragments have been reassembled in different
positions. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Encourage Understanding through Reenactment<span
style='text-decoration:none'> </span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- Sometimes, it may be helpful to have the exhibit visitor <i>experience
</i>the image, i.e., the AD user could mimic a depicted figure's pose. Since
everyone is aware of his or her own body, this activity provides a concrete way
of understanding difficult poses depicted in a painting. Additionally, by
assuming the pose, the AD user can directly perceive important formal
characteristics of the work, such as symmetry or asymmetry; open or closed
forms; implied action or repose; smooth, flowing lines or angular ones; and the
degree of engagement with the viewer.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Incorporate Sound in Creative Ways<span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sound can serve an interpretive and descriptive purpose, particularly as
an auditory analogue for a work of visual art. A uniquely designed soundscape
can evoke the experience of a display.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>-<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Another way to use sound creatively is to provide on-site recordings of
architectural spaces. For instance, a listener could hear the bustling sounds
of St. Peter's piazza in Rome as he or she approaches its depiction. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Allow People to Touch Works of Art or Artifacts</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- Providing an opportunity to touch three-dimensional works
gives visitors who are blind or visually impaired an immediate, personal
experience with an original work of art. Direct touch is the best way to
explore an object. For conservation reasons, however, some museums require
people to wear thin gloves made of cotton or plastic. An informal poll at the
Museum of Modern Art in New York indicated that most people prefer plastic
gloves to cotton because the texture and temperature of the work's material can
be felt. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Alternative Touchable Materials<span
style='text-decoration:none'> </span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- When it is not possible to touch original works of art,
alternative touchable materials can be provided. In some instances, alternative
materials can provide a fuller and more complete understanding of a work
because they can be touched without gloves. These auxiliary aids include
three-dimensional reproductions; samples of art-making materials such as
marble, bronze, clay, and canvas; examples of the tools used in various media,
such as paintbrushes, chisels, and hammers; and replicas of the objects depicted
in a display. Additionally, it is helpful to have a range of information
available on the unique characteristics of the materials and the way in which
the medium dictates the form. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:9.85pt'>Tactile Illustrations of Artworks<span
style='text-decoration:none'> </span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.85pt'>- Most museum visitors want as much information as
possible. Tactile diagrams or three-dimensional dioramas of a work of art are
effective ways of making visual art accessible. Diagrams are tactile
illustrations of artworks, and they are essentially relief images. They do not
represent the actual object in every detail; they are intended to be used in
conjunction with verbal descriptions.</p>

</span>Audio describers shall respect the privacy and confidentiality of the
client (the entity engaging the services of the describer) and the
individual(s) the client is serving (the consumer(s) of the audio description).</p>

</span>The audio describer’s obligation is two-fold: to the organization

description (consumer(s)).</p>

</span>In some situations the audio describer may have direct contact with the
consumer. In this case, the describer is placed in a confidential relationship
with that individual and as such must maintain that individual’s right to
privacy and confidentiality.</p>

margin-left:91.45pt;text-indent:-27.35pt'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For example, in a theatre, the consumer who is blind may be on a date,
with their family, or in any of a number of social situations. The describer
should respect this and only initiate contact or conversation with the
individual as necessary to ensure that the audio description services are
delivered and received.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3pt;margin-bottom:11.4pt;
margin-left:91.45pt;text-indent:-27.35pt'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>) For example, an organization engaging a describer may be doing so
under a contract or grant, thus the describer would be violating the client’s
confidentiality if they were to discuss the work, whether or how much they are
being paid, etc., outside of what is necessary to seek advice and counsel from
a fellow describer.</p>
