What You'll Learn in This Article:
• What the Google HEART framework is
• Best-practice examples of goals and metrics for higher ed websites
• How best to use the HEART framework, and why it mattersT he only way to truly determine if your website redesign was successful is to measure the impact and learn from it. Many of us have sat in on countless design review meetings that turned into heated discussions about various solves and subjective improvements. Attendees say things like, "I don't like it," or "it probably won't work," amongst other opinions, none of them rooted in data. Eventually, someone says, "let's test it," or, "we can A/B test it." This could be the right thing to do-but for it to work in practice, it's critical to use the right metrics.
Gut feelings are good, but making data-driven decisions is better. Using a framework to decide which metrics will best guide your product down the right path, for the right audiences, is the key. That's where the Google HEART framework comes into play.
HEART is an acronym, standing for:
Happiness

Engagement

Retention



Adoption
How are we attracting new users? (Initial uptake of a product or feature) 
Popular metrics:
• New accounts/visitors: New users applying or registering for an event
• Conversion rate: What percentage of visitors complete an important goal action (like signing up for a visit or requesting information) 
• Transactions & subscriptions: Count of completed goal actions
Retention
How are we keeping people around? (How existing users return and remain active in the product)
Popular metrics:
• Returning users: People coming back to the website
• Repeat transactions: People making more transactions after their first transaction
Task
Are users able to complete tasks easily and with little effort? (Efficiency, effectiveness, and error management)
Popular metrics:
• Completion rate: Percentage of people who complete a process they started
• Success rate: Percentage of people who successfully complete a task
• Average time on task: Average amount of time a user spends attempting a task
• Average time on page/view: Average amount of time spent on a page or screen
• Error counts & error rate: Mistakes or slips users encounter in the product
• Help tickets & support contact (calls, chats, emails): A measure of how much help users need (this could be internal or external users)


Overall, the HEART framework is a useful and effective tool for navigating design discussions and measuring the success of a website. Using the right UX research metrics will ensure that you're using relevant and data-driven insights in the design process, which will ultimately create the optimal experience for the end user, and a better chance of you hitting your broader marketing goals.
