Why do you need a playbook?
Why?
You are only truly customer obsessed when your customers can see themselves and access in the content you create.
Why?
Recent studies have shown that 73% of people without disabilities said it was important that companies are inclusive of people with disabilities in their communications, advertising, and marketing. 
That percentage rose to 83% for both caregivers and people with disabilities*. 
* Studies by Morning Consult, Nielsen and the Institute of Public Relations (Institute of PR - VOYA disability report; page 3)
Why?
You're not doing good marketing if you're missing a large portion of your audience.
Why?
You owe it to under-represented communities to get it right.
Tokenism and tropes are harmful to the Disability community.

Defining Inclusive Marketing Core Values 
Core values (for this line of work)
Always practice allyship 
* "Nothing about us, without us"
* Always be authentic
* Do not perpetuate harmful tropes
* Be clear that disability isn't "bad"
* Elevate and prioritize the voice of disabled people
* Examine social roles - position of authority, parents, etc.
Storytelling and Representation best practices
Storytelling & representation should be...
* Authentic
* Balanced and affirmative
* Focused on active roles rather than passive
* Inherently intersectional and diverse
* Solution-oriented
* Free of tropes
Tropes overview
Inspiration Porn Definition: the portrayal of people with disabilities as inspirational solely or in part on the basis of their disability; society's tendency to reduce people with disabilities to objects of inspiration.
Tropes overview
Emotional Manipulation
Definition: the concept that content featuring people with disabilities needs to be emotional or tear jerking to be worth watching. 
This type of content takes you on an emotional journey where first you feel sad or concerned for a person or PWD, and then relieved, often through a solution proposed by a brand. 
Production best practices
Before you create (Pre-Production)
* Diverse casting
* Accessible situations/sets
* Think about accessibility in advance
o E.g. audio descriptions, light sensitivity, cognitive disabilities, etc.
Before you create (Pre-Production) - cont'd
* Are my creative partners committed to accessibility?
* Have I ensured that both crew and talent can easily access the premises and communicate?
* Have I consulted with talent or agency to see if someone needs a reasonable accommodation?
While you create (On Set)
* Provide disability etiquette training and refresher for everyone on set
* Ensure framing and composition should promote equality
* Be mindful of camera angles
* Create a safe and trusting environment to allow for disabled talent to feel empowered to call out things that are inauthentic
After you've created (Post-Production)
Music/Voice over
* Be conscious of your music's impact on anxiety, PTSD, etc.
* Watch out for tropes caused by music/voice over
* Use plain language
* Use descriptive VO
Video accessibility

* Transcripts
Examples
