<p class=MsoNormal>This is the third book I have written about using screen
reader programs in the Windows environment. The first one was about formatting
Word documents. The second one concerned browsing the Internet. I initially
thought about continuing writing in piecemeal fashion, perhaps tackling Excel
or PowerPoint as standalone projects. But upon further reflection, I thought a
book resembling a one-stop shop” would make a more meaningful contribution to
the blindness community. Hence, this book endeavors to cover what I consider to
be all the basics that a screen reader user needs for using the most important
applications in the Windows environment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When students take science or math classes, it’s a given
that they get a textbook. By contrast, screen reader trainees are often pretty
much on their own when it comes to finding useful reference material. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To be sure, a wealth of available training and reference resources
exists, but it is scattered about in user manuals, websites, podcasts, YouTube
videos, books and technology discussion lists. Unlike an iPhone which is a
tightly-integrated environment where a single company controls all the hardware
and software, learning how to use a PC with screen readers involves gaining
familiarity with your individual desktop or laptop computer, the Windows
operating system, one or more screen reader programs, several Microsoft Office
software applications, one or more web browsers, and a few other important
applications like Adobe Acrobat Reader and Dropbox. Experienced screen reader
users are adept at finding what they need, but less experienced users too often
remain frustrated and confused. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My hope is that this book becomes a standard reference for
using Windows on the PC with screen reader programs. You might ask whether such
a resource has ever existed in the past? As far as I am aware, The answer is
no. It is not meant to replace all the other reference resources, but rather to
provide a solid foundation, all in a single place. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Much of the screen reader basic training I conduct takes
place over two to four -week time periods. After considerable repetition and
refinement, I have sort of developed a script in my head. Much of it is
transcribed here. The book covers all that material and extends it, hence its subtitle
“All the Basics and More.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The overall objective of this book is to provide a solid foundation
for using Job Access with Speech (JAWS), Non-Visual Desktop Access (NVDA), and Windows
Narrator with the most important applications used on the PC. These include the
Windows operating system, the four primary Office Suite applications (Word,
Outlook, excel and PowerPoint), and the three most commonly used web browsers
(Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox). Dropbox and OneDrive, two
popular Cloud-based file sharing programs, are also covered. So too is Adobe Acrobat
Reader for accessing PDF files and Zoom Cloud Meeting for participating in
remote teleconferences. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The book is intended for both beginners and intermediate
users. It is hoped that those who already have a fair amount of experience
using screen reader programs in the Windows environment will find useful tools
and techniques to enhance their skills.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Software versions used in this book include the Windows 10 21H2
build which came out in November 2021, the October 2021 release of Windows 11, JAWS
2021, NVDA 2021.1, and the version of Narrator that came out in Spring 2020,
and which has not been significantly updated since. I use Office 365. Where
differences exist between the Office 365 licensed version and purchased
versions of Office 2019 or 2016, these are noted. Regarding Windows 10 and 11,
I discuss differences I have detected, but with the caveat that Windows 11 is only
a few months old, and will presumably evolve over the coming months. Therefore,
I may have failed to detect some differences, and things may change as
Microsoft digests customer feedback on Windows 11. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I should also mention that the book does not address screen
magnification for low-vision users. Nor does it address use of Braille displays
for the unfortunate reason that my Braille skills are woefully inadequate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most efficient way to move through this book to find the
information you want is to navigate by heading. There are two ways to do this
with each of the screen reader programs. First, with JAWS and Narrator, access
a list of headings by pressing Insert F6. Normally, you could then Down and Up
arrow to move heading by heading, and then press Enter to get into the text at
that point. But because this book has more than 500 headings, this is not an
efficient way to move around. Instead, after pressing Insert F6, press the
letter C to first-letter navigate chapter by chapter. Down arrow to a section
that interests you, and press Enter to go to that section in the text. Or if
you already know the number of the chapter you want, after pressing Insert F6,
press that number on the number row. This brings you to the first section in
that chapter. Then Down arrow to the section you want to read and press Enter
to get into the text at that point. With NVDA, you can also access a list of
headings, but I find this confusing. To learn why I feel this way, see Chapter 3.5.1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With all three screen readers, you can also switch to a
virtual mode in Word. This takes the document out of edit mode and enables you
to efficiently navigate by heading level. With JAWS, press Insert Z. You can
then press one on the number row to jump chapter by chapter because each
chapter title is marked as a level one heading. You can then press two on the
number row to skip to each level two heading within the chapters, and so on. The
NVDA and Narrator equivalents are called Browse mode and Scan mode, respectively.
With both of these screen readers, press Insert and the Spacebar together to
activate these modes. As with JAWS, you can then press one, two, etc. to jump
by each heading level. To find out more about these navigation modes, see
Chapter 3.5.1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When finished, press Insert Z with JAWS again to turn Quick
keys off, or Insert Spacebar to turn off the NVDA Browse mode or the Narrator Scan
mode. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But here’s a little hint. Leave these modes on because this
will prevent you from mistakenly typing random text into the book. If you
inadvertently place typos in the text, be sure not to save the document when
you exit out of it. To exit without saving, press Alt F4, tab to the Don’t save
button, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Throughout this book, you will encounter a number of links
to web pages where you can find out more about a particular topic. Assuming your
computer is connected to the Internet, press Enter on the link to open the
associated web page. With JAWS and Narrator, you can also press Insert F7 to
get a list of links. With NVDA, Insert F7 brings up an Elements List. See
Chapter 3.5.1 on how to use the NVDA Elements list in Word. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are also several footnotes. Presence of a footnote is
indicated by a numbered superscript in the main text. To navigate to footnote
text, press the Control and Page down keys together to go to the top of the
next page. Then Up arrow a few times to the footnote text. With JAWS, you can
also navigate to footnotes by turning on Quick keys. To do this, press Insert Z
(JAWS will say “Quick keys on”), and navigate to the next and previous footnote
by pressing O and Shift O, respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here’s how the book is organized. It has ten chapters and
three appendices. The First chapter covers basic settings for the three screen
reader programs – JAWS, NVDA and Windows Narrator. It also discusses how to
access help resources. Chapter Two deals primarily with file and folder
management in the Windows operating system environment. I highlight the most
significant differences I have detected between Windows 10 and 11 that may be of
relevance to screen reader users. The chapter also identifies settings you may
want to change when you first get your computer, menu types and dialog box
elements you will encounter, text navigation, reading and editing, and options
for opening programs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next four chapters cover the Microsoft Office Suite.
Drawing on my first book,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[1]</span></span></span></a>
Chapter Three covers formatting documents in Word. It provides an overview of
ribbon menus and when to use them, as well as a number of useful formatting tools.
Chapter 4 covers Outlook, including message basics, attachments, navigating and
managing folders, contacts, and the Calendar. The fifth chapter discusses
Excel, including elements of basic spreadsheets, formulas, sorting data, and
various other operations. Creating PowerPoint presentations is covered in
Chapter Six. Different slide and presentation formats are discussed. Strategies
for making effective presentations are identified. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chapter Seven discusses web browsing with Google Chrome,
Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox. It draws extensively on my second book. <a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[2]</span></span></span></a> The eighth chapter
returns to the screen reader programs, this time identifying useful
customizations used in conjunction with Windows, the Office Suite and web
browsers. Chapter Nine covers tools for proofreading and review, including spellchecking,
the JAWS Text Analyzer and Speech and Sounds Schemes features, the NVDA
Document Formatting and the Narrator Verbosity features, and Comments and Track
Changes in Word. The final chapter identifies a set of other useful applications,
topics, and tools. Applications covered include reading PDFs with Adobe Acrobat
Reader DC, and file sharing with Dropbox and OneDrive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The book includes three appendices. The first one presents a
list of keystrokes to serve as a convenient reference. Appendix II is a
glossary with over 100 definitions of computer-related terms. The final
appendix provides a set of practice exercises you can complete to hone your
skills. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I would like to thank Greg Donnelly and Dina Rosenbaum,
President and Chief Program Officer, respectively, at the Carroll Center for
the Blind for providing a wonderful work environment and encouraging me to
write this book. Heather Thomas and Bruce Howell, also of The Carroll Center,
provided detailed chapter-by-chapter comments identifying mistakes, as well as ways
to improve the book and make the text clearer. I cringe whenever I think about
what this book would have looked like without their invaluable contributions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Toc58830999"></a><a name="_Toc58926337"></a><a
name="_Toc59171419">I alone am responsible for all errors, inaccuracies, and
omissions. That said, this book was finalized in November and December 2021,
and all steps and procedures presented here were double-checked then. However,
technology is always changing, so some of the text below may become outdated as
time passes. It is my intention to regularly update the book. Beyond that, it
is my hope that this book becomes a standard reference for screen reader users
wishing to become more productive in the Windows environment, as well as for
others whose vocation is to help blind people learn how to use assistive
technology. </a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you would like to make suggestions on ways to improve the
book, new topics for inclusion in future editions, or alert me to errors, I
would be grateful for your input. You can contact me by email at <a
href="mailto:david.kingsbury@carroll.org">david.kingsbury@carroll.org</a>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order for as many people as possible to have access to
this book, we at the Carroll Center have decided to distribute it free-of-charge.
It is my intention to issue regular updates, revising it to reflect changes in
technology and adding sections. This will make it a living document rather than
a one-off that loses its relevance in just a short time - a frequent problem with
technology books. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you appreciate the information you find in the book, the
effort it took me to write it, and the sacrifices made by my wonderful
colleagues who took time out of their busy schedules to review it, I would be
eternally grateful if you made a contribution to the Carroll Center. You can do

<p class=MsoNormal>This chapter provides basic information about the three
leading screen reader programs used in conjunction with the Windows operating
system: Job Access with Speech (JAWS), Non-Visual Desktop Access (NVDA), and
Windows Narrator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is a screen reader program? This definition comes from
the American Foundation for the Blind: “Screen readers are software programs
that allow blind or visually impaired users to read the text that is displayed
on the computer screen with a speech synthesizer or braille display. A screen
reader is the interface between the computer's operating system, its
applications, and the user. The user sends commands by pressing different
combinations of keys on the computer keyboard or braille display to instruct
the speech synthesizer what to say and to speak automatically when changes
occur on the computer screen.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[3]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Speech is substituted for vision and keystroke combinations
are used for navigation and executing commands in place of the mouse. These
keystrokes may be ones created for the screen reader program itself, or they
may be Windows-based keystrokes. The vast majority of keystrokes covered in
this book are actually Windows keystrokes rather than keystrokes created by screen
reader program developers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will first cover modifier keys. These are common to all
three screen readers. I will then cover the basics of each of the screen reader
programs. More advanced topics such as how to customize these programs will be
covered later in the book.</p>

<h2>1.1 Modifier Keys</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each screen reader program allows you to use up to three
modifier keys. A modifier key, when used in combination with other keys,
executes a function of the screen reader program. For example, the Insert Key
held down together with T reveals the title of the open window for all three
screen reader programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The three possible modifier keys are the actual Insert key
(also known as the Extended Insert key), the Zero key on the number pad, and
the Caps lock key. All desktop keyboards have these three keys. Some laptop
models lack one or both of the Insert keys. For Narrator, all three modifier
keys are set by default. For JAWS and NVDA, the Insert and Num Pad Zero keys
are set by default, but you need to manually add the Caps lock key. I will
discuss how to do this later in the JAWS section of this chapter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the Caps lock key is set as a modifier key, to actually
use it for locking and unlocking capital letters, tap it twice quickly to
toggle it on and off. For Fusion users running ZoomText and JAWS together, you
will need to press the Caps lock key three times rather than twice. In many
situations, you will probably prefer to use the Caps lock key with your left
hand if the additional combination keys are located on the right side of the
keyboard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>User guides for each of the three screen reader programs
also refer to modifier keys as the JAWS, NVDA, or Narrator key. For the
remainder of the book, to streamline the text, I will simply say “Insert key”
when referring to use of modifier keys. </p>

<h2>1.2 JAWS Basics</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>To open the JAWS program, press Control Alt J together. To
close JAWS, press Insert F4, followed by pressing the Spacebar to confirm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You must manually set up the shortcut keystroke for opening
the program. Unlike for NVDA and Narrator, it is not automatically done as part
of the initial installation. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Windows M or Windows D to go to the Desktop.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press J to go to the JAWS Icon, but do not press Enter on it. This icon
is placed on the Desktop during program installation. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow to Properties, and press Enter. If
you are using a laptop computer without a dedicated applications key, press
Shift F10 instead (for more on using the Applications key to bring up context
menus, see Chapter 2.4.1.3).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab twice to the Shortcut key edit box, and type in the letter J
(Control and Alt are automatically added).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If a Continue button appears, press the Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You should now be done. However, if you do not have
administrative rights, you will also have to Enter the administrator’s password
after pressing the Continue button.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am sometimes asked why a blind person would ever want to
close JAWS or another default screen reader if having it open is the only way
to know what is going on. There are at least three reasons. First, if you use
more than one screen reader, you will want to know how to open and exit each
one. You will want to exit the currently operating screen reader before opening
a new one to avoid voices speaking simultaneously. Second, sometimes your
screen reader “misbehaves.” It stops speaking for no apparent reason, reads
content incorrectly, or does other strange things. Closing the screen reader
and reopening it often solves the problem. And third, you are running another
program with its own built-in voice that may conflict with the screen reader
voice. Examples are Talking Typer for practicing typing and Kurzweil 1000 for
scanning documents. It may be helpful to close your screen reader while running
these programs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is possible to change the Voice rate, or voice speed,
with all three screen readers. With JAWS, you can change both the default Voice
rate, as well as change it temporarily as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>To change the default Voice rate, hold down the Control, Windows,
and Alt keys together, and then press the Page up and Page down keys to
increase and decrease the Voice rate, respectively. As you increase the Voice
rate, JAWS will say “faster, faster.” As you decrease it, JAWS will say
“slower, slower.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The first method for changing the Voice rate temporarily is to
hold down the Control and Alt keys together, and then press the Page up and
Page down keys to increase and decrease it, respectively. Here too, JAWS will
say “faster, faster” and Slower, slower.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The second method is used with the Say all or Continuous reading
keystroke, allowing you to adjust the Voice rate without interrupting speech.
Press Insert and the Down arrow Key together to start continuous reading. Then
press the Page up and Page down keys to increase and decrease it, respectively.
As you press Page up or Page down, reading will recommence at the top of the
paragraph you are currently in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this context, “temporary” means that once you leave the
window where you have adjusted the Voice rate, either by Alt Tabbing away from
the window or closing the window with Alt F4, it reverts back to the default
rate.</p>

<h3>1.2.1 Basic Settings</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are accessed in the Basic settings dialog. To examine
these, you need to get into the JAWS menus. There are various ways to open the
JAWS menus. One way is to do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Windows D or Windows M to go to the Desktop. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press J to get to the icon for your version of JAWS, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter or Right arrow to open the Options submenu.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on Basics.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab through the various settings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will only discuss the settings I consider the most
important ones you may wish to change. These are listed below in the order in
which they are encountered as you Tab through the Basic settings dialog.</p>

<h4>1.2.1.1 Automatically start JAWS</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is important if you want JAWS to start speaking during
the computer startup and login process. Note that you need to have
administrator privileges to make any of these startup changes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want JAWS to be your default screen reader program
and you are not sharing the computer with sighted users, do the following: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on this setting which opens a smaller dialog box within the
larger Basic settings dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You first land on the Automatically start JAWS at the log on screen
checkbox. If it is not already checked, press the Spacebar to check it. This
ensures that JAWS will start speaking when the Windows log on screen appears.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Automatically start JAWS after log on for all users, and check
this checkbox if you are not sharing the computer with sighted users. Even if
you are, perhaps still check it and tell them how they can exit JAWS by
pressing Insert F4. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Start JAWS after log on for this user combo box. Assuming you
are the primary user of the computer, Up or Down arrow to Always.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>JAWS will say “User account control dialog.” If you have administrator
rights to make changes to the computer, Tab to the Yes button and press Enter.
If you do not have administrator rights, the computer administrator will need
to make these changes for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This returns you to the Basic settings dialog. Continue
tabbing.</p>

<h4>1.2.1.2 Prompt to Confirm When Exiting JAWS</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is checked by default, meaning that when you attempt to
exit JAWS by pressing Insert F4, you will first be asked if you want to exit
JAWS. If you uncheck this checkbox, when you press Insert F4, you will
immediately exit the JAWS program. If you are a beginner, you may be more
comfortable keeping this checked so that you don’t accidentally exit JAWS. Once
you are a bit more experienced, uncheck it to eliminate the step of needing to
confirm before exiting.</p>

<h4>1.2.1.3 Automatic Notification of Updates</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is checked by default and it is a good idea to leave it
this way. JAWS updates are issued every couple of months or so, and contain bug
fixes and new features. You should stay up-to-date and performing updates only
take a few minutes. You don’t need to do updates immediately, but can wait
until a time when it is more convenient. </p>

<h4>1.2.1.4 Run JAWS from System Tray</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Checking this does two useful things. First, when you Alt
Tab through your open windows, JAWS will no longer appear as one of the
windows. I like doing this because it saves me an unnecessary Alt Tab. Second,
it adds the option of pressing Insert J to open the JAWS menus. I like this
because it is a quick and easy way to open the JAWS menus from anywhere in the
computer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you press Insert J, a list of submenus appears,
including submenus for options, utilities, languages, and help. Down arrow and
press Enter or Right arrow to open one of the submenus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you make this change, it will take effect the next <span
style='line-height:107%'>time you start JAWS. </span></p>

<h4>1.2.1.5 Use Keyboard Layout</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This combo box has three choices: desktop, laptop, or
kinesis. The default is desktop, and Kinesis is a specialized ergonomic
keyboard that you would only choose if you had one of them. JAWS keystrokes
frequently use keys located on the numeric keypad on the right side of the
keyboard. Many laptop computers do not have numeric keypads. But even if you
have a numeric keypad, I recommend you choose the laptop option which has two
advantages. First, it gives you an additional JAWS modifier key option because
it enables the Caps lock key to become an additional JAWS modifier key. This
makes it easier to execute JAWS keystroke combinations that require pressing a
key with your right hand. For example, it is easier to tell the time by
pressing Caps lock with your left hand and F12 with your right hand, than using
your right hand to press both the Insert and F12 keys at the same time. Second,
you will now need to quickly press the Caps lock key twice to toggle Caps lock
on and off. This makes it less likely that you will accidentally turn Caps lock
on by mistake. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I always put computers in laptop mode, regardless of whether
I am using a desktop or laptop keyboard. I am not aware of any disadvantages if
you choose this option. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After Up or Down arrowing to your keyboard layout choice,
Tab to the OK button and press Enter to save your changes. </p>

<h3>1.2.2 Getting Help</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>JAWS help resources are extensive and varied, including hot
keys providing keystroke lists, a user guide that you can access in various
ways, tutorials, and numerous online training resources. I will start with hot
keys. </p>

<h4>1.2.2.1 JAWS Hot Keys</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>While in any application, you can press Insert H and Insert
W to quickly get a list of JAWS and Windows keystrokes, respectively. Note that
while the Insert and Caps lock keys can usually be used interchangeably, only
the Insert key can be used for bringing up the list of JAWS keyboard commands.
The Caps lock key will not work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This tool can be helpful to both novices and experienced
users. For example, if you are on a web page, pressing Insert H brings up a
virtual viewer screen that gives you a list of JAWS web navigation keystrokes
that range from basic ones like those for headings, links, and form fields, to
somewhat more advanced ones like those for frames and placemarkers. When the
Virtual viewer appears, it will read continuously. Press the Control key to
stop speech and press the Down arrow key to read line by line through the list
of keystrokes. You can select and copy text in the Virtual viewer if you want
to paste it into a Word document. When finished, you must press the Escape key
in order to exit the Virtual viewer and return to the screen you were on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pressing Insert W provides a list of Windows keystrokes for
the application you are currently in. Navigate through the list as above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another quick help keystroke is Insert F1. This is called Screen-Sensitive
Help. Here too, depending on what application you are in, information for
navigating that application is provided. I find it is more helpful for some
applications than for others. Examples where it provides particularly helpful
information are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In Word documents, information on margin dimensions and page
header/footer text and page numbering, table navigation.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>At the top of a web page, information on the number of regions,
links and headings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In JAWS settings menus, explanations of what each setting will
do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here to, when finished, press the Escape key to exit the
Virtual viewer.</p>

<h4>1.2.2.2 Help Topics</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unlike with the other two screen readers, the JAWS user
guide is not accessed all in one place online. Instead, you access it from
inside the JAWS Help menu and is called Help topics. Accessing Help topics is a
bit like the story of the blind man and the elephant. Depending on how you
approach the Help topics, you will get a view from the trunk, legs or tail.
While this makes accessing help more flexible, it also requires some
explanation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To access JAWS Help topics:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Assuming you have set up the JAWS hot key as outlined above, press
Control Alt J. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you hear “JAWS context menu,” press H to access the Help menu. If you
do not hear this, press the Alt key to open the menus and then press H. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow twice to JAWS Help topics and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The JAWS Help topics are organized into four views or
“pages.” You navigate through them by pressing Control Tab. These four pages
are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Contents page: A tree view of “books,” sections and individual
Help topics.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Index page: A list of keywords, similar to an index at the back
of a textbook.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Search page: For conducting full text searches. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Favorites page: For storing favorite previous searches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The window for each of the pages is divided into two panes.
The left pane is for navigating to Help topics or entering search terms and
finding results. Content is found in the right pane. Switch between the two
panes by pressing F6. When you navigate to your desired topic in the left pane,
you must press Enter on it before switching to the content in the right pane.
If you do not do this, the content displayed will be that of the previous topic
you accessed rather than the one you want now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I consider the Contents and Search pages to be the most
useful. I will only cover these two pages here. For the Index page, if you do
not guess a term that is contained in the index, no results will appear.
Regarding the Favorites page, I think it is simply more straightforward to
search for terms as they come up rather than maintain a list of favorites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned above, the Contents page is organized in a tree
view. See Chapter 2.6.4.5 on how to navigate tree views. The tree view is
organized into “books” at level 0. There are 17 books in the JAWS 2021 Help
Content page. “Topics” are found at levels 1 and 2 of the tree view. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you navigate to a topic that interest you, remember to
press Enter on it. Then press F6 to move to the right pane where you can read
the content using standard text reading keystrokes. Because the text is
presented in HTML format, as on web pages, you can press H here to move to the
next heading. You can also press Insert F7 to get a list of links to access
related sections of the Help topics. If you would like to access additional
Help topics, press F6 to return to the left pane and navigate through the tree
view to find another topic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To now move to the Search Page, press Control Tab twice.
This places you in an edit field where you can type in your search term. Let’s
use the example of typing in “Quick Settings.” Now Tab once to the List topics
button and press Enter or the Spacebar. Tab one more time to a list of search
results. For Quick Settings, there are 87 search results. You can Down arrow through
them, or first-letter navigate. Obviously, in this case it is more efficient to
press Q for Quick Settings. As above, be sure to press Enter. Then press F6 to
switch to the right pane to read the associated content. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I generally find the Contents page more useful for obtaining
information on more general topics. Examples are getting an overview of things
like Convenient OCR or Text Analyzer. For more specific concerns, the Search
page often gets you to the content you want more quickly. </p>

<h4>1.2.2.3 Other Useful JAWS Help Resources</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additional help resources can be accessed through the JAWS
Help menu. For a useful orientation, go to the Help topics Search page and
search for Help Menu Overview. Among the most useful additional resources are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Commands Search: Use this tool to locate specific JAWS
keystrokes. You can also access Commands Search by pressing Insert and Spacebar
together and then J. This lands you in a search box where you can type in the
term for which you want to get a list of relevant keystrokes. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Basic Training: This is a set of nine tutorial modules where you
can follow instructions either through text or a recorded voice reading the
text. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Web Resources: This submenu of the Help menu provides links to
various training pages on the Freedom Scientific website. Two pages are
especially worth highlighting: Surfing the Internet where detailed information
is presented about navigating the web with JAWS; and the Free Training Webinar
page where you can listen to and download archived webinars on a wide variety
of topics. </p>

<h2>1.3 NVDA Basics</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Press Control Alt N to open NVDA. To exit or “quit” the
program, press Insert Q, followed by tabbing to the OK button and pressing the
Spacebar. When you open and quit the program, NVDA will indicate this with
ascending and descending sounds, respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NVDA shortcut keystrokes for increasing and decreasing the
Voice rate are Control Insert Up arrow and Control Insert Down arrow,
respectively. Unlike JAWS, it is not possible to temporarily change the Voice
rate.</p>

<h3>1.3.1 Important Settings</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To open the NVDA menus where important settings are found,
press Insert N. Remember that the Caps lock key is an additional NVDA modifier
key. Using that key in combination with N is easier for most people. I will
discuss three settings categories where the most important settings are found:
General, Speech, and Keyboard. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To access General Settings:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Caps lock N, Down arrow once to the Preferences submenu, and press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter again on Settings. This lands you on the first category
which is General. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='page-break-after:avoid'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this
category, Tab to the Show exit options when exiting NVDA checkbox. This is
checked by default, meaning that a dialog box will come up when you press
Insert Q to quit NVDA. You will then need to Tab once to the OK button and
press Enter. If you uncheck it, pressing Insert Q will immediately close NVDA.
This is my preference. A descending noise will be heard, providing a clear
indication that you are exiting the program. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Play sounds when starting or exiting NVDA checkbox. This is
checked by default and you should leave it that way. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Login level - start NVDA after I sign in checkbox. Check this
only if you want NVDA to be your default screen reader. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Login level – Use NVDA during sign in requires administrator
privileges checkbox. Check this only if you want NVDA as your default. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Automatically check for NVDA updates checkbox and leave this
checked. NVDA updates are issued roughly every three months and it is good to
stay current. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Notify for pending update on startup checkbox. Leave this
checked for the same reason.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter to save changes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NVDA uses the voices built into the Windows operating
system, as well as one other category of voices. These include: E Speak
English, Microsoft Speech API 4 (SAPI 4 for short), Microsoft Speech API 5
(SAPI 5), Windows 1 Core Voices, and No speech.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>E Speak English is a synthesized voice that many people,
including me, find annoying. For a long time, it was the default voice, as well
as the voice you heard when installing NVDA updates. Somebody suggested at some
point to change the default installation voice to one of the Windows voices. I
am convinced this caused many people to start using NVDA because the E Speak
voice was jarring to a large number of potential users. If it was the first
thing you heard, and you were unaware that you could change voices, it was
enough to cause you to avoid using NVDA. This was the case for me until I got
to know the program better and realized I could change voices. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To access the voices, you need to go to the Speech Settings.
Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert N, Down arrow once to Preferences, and press Enter. Note
that I said earlier that I would use the Insert key as a convention for all
modifier keys. But for accessing the NVDA menus, you will probably find it
easier to press Caps lock N. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter again on Settings. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow once to Speech. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Speech properties page where the current voice
synthesizer package is indicated. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To switch to another voice package, Tab once to the Change button and
press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in the Select synthesizer combo box. Up or Down arrow to your
new choice and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This returns you to the Speech properties page where the new voice
synthesizer package is indicated. You can now Tab to change several settings
for this voice package. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Voice combo box. Here you can Up or Down arrow to select
another voice within this package. As you arrow down, you will hear a sample of
each voice.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Rate slider. Press the Left or Right arrow to lower or raise
the Voice rate by one percent. Press Page up or Page down to increase or
decrease the speed by 10 percent increments. If this is the last setting you
want to change, press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Otherwise
continue tabbing to the Punctuation level combo box. Up and Down arrow through
the choices which include none, some, most, and all. The default is Some. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>11.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Tab
to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last important initial area to examine in Settings is
the Keyboard category. This category contains options that set how NVDA behaves
as you type. To access it:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Caps lock N, Down arrow once to Preferences, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter again on Settings. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Keyboard, and Tab through the options. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will cover what I consider to be the more important ones
in the order in which they appear as you Tab through the dialog box:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Keyboard layout: This combo box lets you choose between Desktop
and Laptop layouts. Laptop layout behaves similarly to Laptop layout with JAWS
(see Chapter1.2.15 above).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Select NVDA Modifier Keys: The checkboxes in this list are the
same as those for the other two screen readers: the Caps lock key, the Insert
key on the Number pad, and the Extended Insert key.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='page-break-after:avoid'><span

</span></span>Speak Typed Characters and Speak Typed Words: This is where you
make your Typing echo selection. Typing echo is the audio feedback that is
“echoed” back to you as you type. Combinations of checking and unchecking these
checkboxes gives the four Typing echo options. </p>

</span></span>Speech interrupt for typed characters: If switched on, speech is
interrupted each time a character is typed. This is on by default, and you want
to keep it on. Otherwise, if, for example, you navigate to a link on a web page,
you will need to hear the entire label of the link before pressing Enter to
activate it. This has the effect of making your computer sound very sluggish. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Speech interrupt for Enter key: If on, speech will be interrupted

Control V, etc.) when I press them. I toggle it off when doing a lot of Up and Down
arrowing to navigate text line by line, not wanting to hear “Down arrow, Down
arrow, Down arrow” constantly. I hope that some day the NVDA folks either
remove this from the list of command keys, or allow a degree of customization

<h3>1.3.2 Getting Help</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>NVDA help resources can be found by pressing Insert N and Down
arrowing to the Help submenu and pressing Enter. Here you can find the NVDA
user guide and a quick reference guide for commands. Access the online user
guide at:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html">NVDA

<p class=MsoNormal>The user guide can be easily navigated by heading. Each
chapter is a level one heading. <span class=MsoHyperlink><span
style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none'>The quick reference guide appears
in tabular form so can be navigated using table navigation keystrokes for the
web. See Chapter 7.1.2 and 7.1.5 for details on heading and table navigation on
the web, respectively.</span></span></p>

<h2>1.4 Windows Narrator</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Narrator is Microsoft’s own screen reader, integrated into
the Windows operating system. Although Narrator has been around for a long
time, it has only become a credible screen reader in the last several years.
Impressive progress has been made to transform Narrator into a viable
alternative to JAWS and NVDA. While it does not yet have as extensive a set of
features as the other two screen readers, Microsoft has shown a strong
commitment to accessibility. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Control Windows Enter is the toggle for opening and closing
Narrator. When you open Narrator, you will hear “starting Narrator.” When
exiting, you will hear “exiting Narrator.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first time you open Narrator, you land in the Narrator
Home page window rather than remaining in the current window. You will probably
not want this to happen every time you open Narrator. To turn this off:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Windows N to get into the Narrator Settings menu.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Show narrator Home when Narrator starts checkbox and uncheck
it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Windows Enter to exit Narrator and the same keystroke to
reopen it to verify that Narrator no longer opens on Home. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you ever want to open Narrator Home, press Control Windows N, Tab
once to Open Narrator Home, and press Enter.</p>

<h3>1.4.1 Important Settings</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Control Windows N is the keystroke for opening Narrator
Settings. Press Tab to move through them. I will discuss below what I consider
to be some of the more important settings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This chapter discusses the Windows operating system
environment, including differences between Windows 10 and 11, keyboard and
screen layout, the different types of menus you will encounter when executing
commands, settings you may wish to change, file management basics, and text
reading and editing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Windows is the operating system for your computer. In
essence, the operating system is the brain of your computer. It is defined by <a
href="https://techterms.com/">Techterms.com</a> as follows: “An operating
system, or &quot;OS,&quot; is software that communicates with the hardware and
allows other programs to run. It is comprised of system software, or the
fundamental files your computer needs to boot up and function. Every desktop
computer, tablet, and smartphone includes an operating system that provides
basic functionality for the device.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Windows 10 first appeared in 2015. The new Windows 11 became
available in October 2021. The next section discusses differences between the
two versions of this operating system.</p>

<h2>2.1 Overview of Differences Between Windows 10 and Windows 11</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Over the past several years, major updates of Windows 10
have been released twice annually, in the spring and fall. The most recent
major update is referred to as Windows 21H2, shorthand for the second half of
2021. Minor updates are released once or twice weekly, and are done
automatically. These regular updates are primarily bug fixes and
security-related.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With much fanfare, Microsoft rolled out the new Windows 11
operating system on October 5, 2021. Millions of PC users have recently been
asking the question “should I upgrade?&quot; The first thing to say is that
there is no urgency to quickly switch over to Windows 11. Microsoft will
continue supporting Windows 10 with regular updates until at least October 2025.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second thing I will say is that, as of the finalization of
this book in late 2021, I have not yet encountered any compelling new features
that make me want to rush out and upgrade. Nor are there any serious accessibility
problems that would compel me to avoid switching over. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most significant changes are visual or cosmetic in
nature and will not be covered here. Others are, at least in my opinion, not
terribly significant, like renaming the Ease of Access Center as the
“Accessibility Center.” Or a new set of sound schemes you hear after initiating
various actions like installing a new device. Or the intricacies of navigating
to places in the Start menu that are more efficiently accessed in other ways.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few caveats. I have only briefly used Windows 11, so this
is by no means a comprehensive list of changes. And as Microsoft receives
customer feedback, the company may make changes over the next few months that
render some of my current observations out-of-date. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will now identify those differences between Windows 10 and
Windows 11 that I consider important. First, File Explorer, the app used for
file and folder management, has a different menu structure than Windows 10.
Windows 10 uses the ribbon structure (see Chapter 2.4.1.1 on ribbon
organization and navigation) while Windows 11 has more of a drop-down menu
structure. To access the new Windows 11 menu, referred to as the “Command
bar,”, first open it by pressing the Alt key. You first land on the New button
on the Command bar. You will hear that it is collapsed. Right and Left arrow to
various other buttons, some of which are also collapsed. These include Cut,
Copy, Paste, Rename, Share, Delete, Sort, View, and More app bar. For any of
the collapsed buttons, press the Spacebar to expand them, and Up or Down arrow
to the command you want to execute or setting you want to change. A helpful
article that provides a detailed overview of the Windows 11 File Explorer menu
structure can be found at:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="https://allthings.how/how-to-use-the-new-file-explorer-in-windows-11/">How
to Use Windows 11 File Explorer, by Kazim Ali Alvi</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sections of this chapter where the Windows 11 Command bar is
referred to include those for showing file extensions, changing folder views,
sorting files and folders, and toggling on and off the full folder path display
in the Title bar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another difference between Windows 10 and 11 relates to the
steps for changing default programs. I consider this a big step backwards. With
Windows 10, it is quick and easy to change default web browsers and media
players. It is considerably more complicated and time-consuming to do this with
Windows 11. Some reviewers criticize Microsoft for deliberately doing this to
stifle competition, hoping that people will just stick with Edge and Groove
Music, the factory web browser and media player defaults, respectively. I
frequently change my default web browser, and greatly appreciate how quick and
easy it is to do with Windows 10. Given my own priorities (after all, I wrote a
book called “When One Web Browser Is Not Enough”), this is an important reason
why I will not be switching to Windows 11 any time soon. You may be happy
sticking with Edge, or making a one-time switch to a different browser, so this
may not be a deal breaker for you. How to change default programs with Windows
10 and 11 is covered in Chapter 2.5.7. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is possible to customize Windows 10 so that you hear the
familiar Windows 7 sound when you start up your computer. By default, a new sound
is built in when you start Windows 11. See Chapter 2.5.10 on how to enable the
startup sound for Windows 10. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Customizing which apps appear in the System Tray is another
area where steps are different between Windows 10 and 11.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now, let’s get familiar with the Windows operating system in
a screen reader environment. </p>

<h2>2.2 Keyboard Help</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>All three screen reader programs have this feature which
helps you learn the functions of important keys on your computer by putting you
in a temporary help mode. This is a safe way to explore your keyboard, so that
you don’t inadvertently execute unwanted functions. For example, if you press
your Delete key, your screen reader will identify the key and say what it does
rather than actually deleting something. This is especially useful if you have
just acquired a new laptop because the location of important navigation keys
varies by laptop model. Their location is more standardized on desktop
keyboards. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pressing Insert 1 on the number row toggles Keyboard Help on
and off with all screen readers. When you do this, JAWS will say “Keyboard Help
On/Off.” NVDA will say “Input Help On/Off” Narrator will say “Input Learning
On/Off.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beyond the keys of the alphabet and the number row, what are
those important navigation keys you want to be able to locate on your computer?
First is the “six-pack,” so named because it is a cluster of six keys (two rows
with three keys each) near the top right side of a standard desktop keyboard.
From left to right, the top row includes the Insert, Home and Page up keys. The
bottom row includes the Delete, End and Page down keys. These keys tend to be
near the top right of most laptop models. For example, most HP models have
these as the top right six keys from right to left in the order Page down, Page
up, End, Home, Delete and Insert. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You should also locate the four arrow keys clustered near
the bottom right of your computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For keyboards with a number pad, when the Num lock key is
switched off, you also have the option of using the keys clustered around the
Five key. The key above, below, to the left and right of the Five key are the
Up, Down, Left and Right arrow keys, respectively. The keys to the left and
right of the Up arrow key are the Home and Page up keys, respectively. The keys
to the left and right of the Down arrow key are the End and Page up keys,
respectively. If this text sounds a bit confusing, it won’t after you turn
Keyboard Help on and play around with it a bit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Starting on the bottom row of your keyboard, at the extreme
left, desktop keyboards usually have three keys to the left of the Spacebar
(Control, Windows, Alt). Laptop keyboards have four keys (Control, Function,
Windows and Alt, with the order of Control and Function flipped for some Lenovo
models). Most desktop keyboards have the Alt, Control and Applications key to
the right of the Spacebar. Beyond an Alt key to the right of the Spacebar,
laptops are not consistent on what is located to the right of the Spacebar. If
your laptop has a dedicated Applications key, it will usually be two keys to
the right of the Spacebar. However, these days many laptops do not have an
Applications key. If this is the case, you must use Shift F 10 instead to
access it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When using Keyboard Help with Insert 1, and based on default
settings for which keys are announced by the three screen readers, NVDA and
Narrator do a better job of announcing the keys along the bottom row of the
keyboard. As well as a few more. When you press the Control, Windows and Alt
keys along the bottom row, JAWS is silent. JAWS also does not announce the
Insert and Shift keys when using Keyboard Help. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, find your Tab and Escape keys which are
consistently found near the top left of all keyboards. Also find the Backspace
key which is usually located on the right side of your keyboard, somewhere
along the second row from the top. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why do these keys matter? Sighted people hardly ever use
these keys because they navigate with the mouse. As a screen reader user, you
will use a variety of combinations involving these keys to substitute for the
mouse. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you get familiar with your keyboard layout, you may
never use Keyboard Help again. But it is a nice feature when you get a new
computer or are using an unfamiliar one. </p>

<h2>2.3 The Desktop</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you boot up your computer, the Desktop is displayed
once the startup process is complete. The Desktop includes a set of icons which
take up most of the screen, and a Taskbar that spans a bottom strip of the
screen. </p>

<h3>2.3.1 Desktop Icons </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Desktop icons represent shortcuts to files, folders,
applications and web pages, as well as files or folders you have saved directly
to the Desktop. These icons are arranged in columns and rows. They are small
files that point to a program, folder, document, or web page. Clicking on a
shortcut icon takes you directly to the object to which the shortcut points.
Pressing the Delete key on such an icon only removes the shortcut. It does not
remove the associated file, folder, or application from your computer. If you
have the Deletion confirmation option enabled (see Chapter 2.5.1), and you
attempt to delete a shortcut, your screen reader program will ask you if you
want to move the shortcut to the Recycle Bin. If you have saved a file or
folder to the Desktop, the deletion confirmation message will ask you whether
you want to move the file or folder to the Recycle Bin. Be sure that this is
what you want to do because, in this case, you are not deleting a shortcut, but
the actual file or folder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The array of icons on desktops differs from one computer to
the next. The only shortcut present on all computers is the one for the Recycle
Bin. After logging in, focus is on the Desktop. To quickly access it at any
time during your computer session, press Windows D or Windows M. Sometimes you
need to press these keystrokes twice to place focus on the Desktop. If you
press these keystrokes several times and do not hear anything, it may be
because your focus is already on the Desktop. If you are not sure, press Insert
T to hear the title of the window. Hopefully, your screen reader will say
“Desktop 1.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To explore which icons are present on your Desktop, press
Windows D or Windows M to go there. Now press either Home or Control Home to
place focus on the top left icon. Unless you have rearranged the icons, the
Recycle Bin icon is usually the top left icon. When you press Control Home,
your screen reader will say the name of that icon, as well as how many icons
are present on your Desktop. You can now Down arrow to go down the first column
of icons. Depending on the size of the icons, screen resolution, and the size
of your monitor, there will be somewhere between five and ten icons in each
column. When you get to the bottom of a column, you can press the Right arrow
to go to the next column and then Up arrow through that column’s icons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Arrowing around is a good way to get an idea of which icons
are present on your Desktop. However, the quick way to get to the icon you want
is to use first-letter navigation. Then press Enter to open the associated
file, folder, program, or web page. How to create desktop shortcuts for
folders, files and programs is covered in Chapter 2.8.1. Creating them for web
pages is covered in Chapter 7.8. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pro-actively managing your Desktop will make you a more
efficient computer user. Below are a few rules of thumb you should follow:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Don’t allow your Desktop to get too cluttered. Delete shortcuts
for things you rarely or never use. Set yourself an upper limit of 40 or 50
desktop icons.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Limit yourself to four or five shortcuts for web pages. Reserve
these for only those web pages you visit several times each week. For web pages
you visit less frequently, create favorites/bookmarks instead (see Chapter
7.7).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Create shortcuts for folders you will visit frequently, including
Documents and Downloads. If you use Dropbox and/or OneDrive, create shortcuts
for these too.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Create shortcuts for files you plan on visiting frequently. For
many years, I have had a contact information file shortcut on my Desktop. It is
a grab bag of phone numbers, street addresses of friends and businesses. I can
easily access it to find contact information, as well as quickly add new
information to it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Create shortcuts for files you plan on visiting frequently in the
short-term. Let’s say you have a work or school assignment that you will be
working on every day for the next two weeks. Create a shortcut to this file so
you can quickly access it. Once the assignment is completed, delete the
shortcut, leaving the associated file somewhere on your computer. I regularly
add and remove shortcuts to files and folders for short-term projects. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people like to reorganize their desktop icons. Others
don’t really care because they exclusively use first-letter navigation to
access them. Changing the size of icons, as well as reorganizing them, is quick
and easy to do. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for changing icon size are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Windows M or Windows D to get to the Desktop.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you land on the top left icon, arrow to any of the other icons (for
some reason, the remaining steps won’t work if you start from this icon). </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Spacebar to deselect all icons.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key where you first land on the View submenu. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To change the size of the icons, press Enter here, Down arrow to your
choice and press Enter. Choices are large, medium, and small. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To reorder your desktop icons:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat steps one through four above. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow once to the Sort by submenu. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter to open this submenu where you can rearrange the sort order
of the icons. Options include name, size, item type, and date modified. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I occasionally find sorting by date modified useful if I
have recently created a shortcut but can’t remember its name. Sorting this way
positions the most recently created shortcuts at either the top left or bottom
right of the Desktop, making it easier to find them. </p>

<h3>2.3.2 The Taskbar</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>With Windows 10, by default, the Taskbar is located along a
bottom strip of the screen. It contains the Start button on the left side and the
System Tray (also known as the Notification Area) on the right. It also
includes the current time on the far right side and a list of recently used
apps to the right of the Start button. You can also pin items to the Taskbar,
but there are more efficient ways to access them. The Windows 11 Taskbar has a
different visual look, but I will not cover it here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Much of the taskbar area contains titles for open windows.
Whenever you open an application, it shows up in the Taskbar. Sighted people
can click on icons for currently open applications, making that window active
and appearing in front of other windows. Screen reader users access these
windows by holding down the Alt and Tab keys together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Start menu appears at the bottom left of the screen. The
quickest way to access it is to press the Windows logo key. This opens the
Start menu with initial focus in a search box. Here you can begin typing the
name of a program, folder, file, or Windows setting you want to access. For
frequently visited programs like Word or Outlook, typing just the first letter
is usually enough to populate the search box with the desired program name. As
soon as you hear the name of the desired program, press Enter to open it. Some
people prefer opening programs in this way. Others prefer accessing them by
creating desktop shortcuts. Do what’s most comfortable for you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can access the list of programs installed on your
computer by pressing the Windows key, and then Down arrowing through the list
of All apps. If you open the Start menu and then press the Tab key, you can
Down arrow through choices which include your user folder, Documents, Pictures,
Settings, and Power. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The System Tray, also known as the Notification Area in
Windows 10, is located in the lower right area of the screen. With JAWS, you
can access it by pressing Insert F11. With NVDA and Narrator, press Windows B,
and then Down arrow through the list. It displays a series of icons for certain
programs, as well as some computer settings, the most important being: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Internet connectivity status: This indicates whether your
computer is connected to a Wi-Fi network, and if so, the network is identified.
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Battery level for laptop computers: The percentage charge is
indicated, as well as whether the computer is plugged in and charging. If only
a percentage level is indicated, the laptop is not plugged in. For some laptop
models, an estimated amount of time before the battery runs out is also
indicated. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Speaker volume: This is expressed as a percentage of the maximum
system volume. Knowing that you can adjust volume via the System Tray can be
useful if you are working on an unfamiliar computer. To adjust the volume,
press Enter on Speaker volume, Down arrow to Open volume mixer and press Enter.
This opens an up down slider. Press the Up and Down arrows to adjust volume by
one percent increments, Page up and Page down to adjust it by 20 percent
increments, or Home or End to maximize or minimize volume. Press Enter to make
your change. Note that for each of these steps, you must press Enter. Pressing
the Spacebar will not work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, with JAWS and NVDA, you can find out the time by
pressing Insert F12. Hold down the Insert key and press F12 twice to hear the
date with these two screen reader programs. With Narrator, pressing Insert F12
will tell you both the time and the date. </p>

<h3>2.3.3 Customizing the System Tray</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can customize the System Tray to add or remove items. To
do this with Windows 10:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Windows key to open the Start menu’s search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the first few letters of the word “taskbar,” minus the quotes, and
press Enter when you hear “Taskbar settings system settings.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to the Notification Area select which items appear on
the Taskbar link, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Always show all icons in the Notification Area button. If you
press the Spacebar to toggle it on, all items (usually 15 to 20) will appear in
the System Tray. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Or if you toggle it off, you can then continue tabbing, pressing the
Spacebar to check and uncheck those items you want to appear or not appear in the
System Tray. Items you should check were mentioned above. There are others you
may also wish to check. For example, if you use Dropbox or OneDrive, it is a
good idea to check these too. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When finished, press Alt F4 to close this window. There is no OK button
here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Choosing which icons appear in the System Tray is more
complicated to do with Windows 11. Note that it is also referred to as the
Taskbar overflow in Windows 11. To change which icons appear in the System
Tray, do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Windows key to open the Start menu search box, type in Control
Panel and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First-letter navigate to the Taskbar and navigation link, and press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Taskbar corner overflow grouping and press the Spacebar to
expand it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to a list of possible icons to include. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow through the choices. When you land on a program or setting
you want to add or remove from the System Tray, Tab once, and press the
Spacebar to toggle it on or off. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab once to return to the list, Down arrow to the next item you
want to include or remove and repeat the above step.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When finished making your selections, press Alt F4 to close this window.
There is no OK button to Tab to. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Open the System Tray by pressing Insert F11 in JAWS or
Windows B with NVDA and Narrator, and verify that your changes appear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As far as I know, if you want all items to appear in the System
Tray, it is not possible to do this by pressing a single checkbox as is the
case with Windows 10. In addition, network status, speaker volume and battery
level for laptops cannot be removed from the System Tray, but this is not a
problem because you should always retain them. </p>

<h3>2.3.4 Powering Off Your Computer from the Desktop</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Don’t make it your routine to press and hold down the Power
button when shutting down. Doing this too often could damage your computer. The
best way to power off is to first navigate to the Desktop and then press Alt
F4, the same keystroke used for closing other windows. This lands you in a
combo box with several choices. Most of the time you land on shutdown. If you
Up or Down arrow there are other choices. In order from the top of the list,
these are switch user, sign out, sleep, shutdown, and restart. If you choose
restart, your computer will power off and then automatically reboot. Update an
shut down and update and restart are sometimes also present. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you press Enter on shutdown, your computer will power off
directly, but only if no windows are open with unsaved files or email messages.
If such windows are still open, your screen reader will indicate that shutdown
or restart has been blocked. If you want to save anything in these still open
windows, Tab to the Cancel button and press Enter. Then Alt Tab to the window
with your unsaved work, and save it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you don’t need to save any of this work, you can Tab a
number of times to the Shutdown anyways or Restart anyways button and press
Enter on it to power off the computer. </p>

name="_Toc40521501">2.4 Accessing Command</a>s</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>On a Windows PC with Microsoft Office, commands are accessed
and executed in several ways. Commands can be found in the ribbon system of
menus, introduced in Office 2007. One can also access a number of commonly used
commands and settings with context menus accessed using the Applications key.
Shortcut keys can be used for quickly executing commands. Common examples from
earlier in this chapter are Control C, Control X, and Control V for copying,
cutting, and pasting files, respectively. Once you navigate to commands via the
ribbons or context menus, some commands can be executed by pressing Enter or
the Spacebar. Others require that you open a dialog box or submenu and navigate
through to modify settings, enter information, and/or execute commands. </p>

<h3>2.4.1 Types of Menus</h3>

<h4><a name="_Toc1629855">2.4.1.1 Ribbons </a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beginning with the Office 2007 suite, Microsoft introduced
ribbons. These have been present ever since for all the Office upgrades: 2010,
2013, 2016, and 2019 (this last being the version used with Microsoft 365
licenses). You will encounter ribbons with Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint.
Ribbons are also present in the Windows 10 version of File Explorer, the
Windows 10 application for managing files and folders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ribbon menus consist of an upper and Lower ribbon. The Upper
ribbon is opened by pressing Alt. A narrow horizontal strip will appear across
the top of the screen. In most cases, the first time you Press Alt during a
session, you will land on the Home tab. A tab is a broad grouping of commands.
One navigates between the various tabs by using Right and Left Arrow keys. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the Upper ribbon, press the Tab key and a second
(wider) horizontal strip appears below it with icons grouped in that tab
category. This is the Lower ribbon. You navigate from one command to the next by
pressing the Tab key. Press Shift Tab to go to the previous command.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By default, both the upper and Lower ribbons are visually
displayed, or expanded, for most of the Microsoft applications. The one
exception is File Explorer, used for managing files and folders, which is
collapsed. That said, you may still find some of these ribbons collapsed that
are supposed to be expanded. You need to expand them to make them behave
correctly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To do this, while in the ribbons, press Control F1. Your
screen reader should say “ribbons expanded.” Once expanded, they tend to stay
that way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s hard to know if the ribbons are behaving correctly when
you are new to them, because you don’t know what correct behavior sounds like.
If you press Alt the first time during a session in an Office application, and
you land on the File tab, that is a giveaway that the ribbons are collapsed.
You will need to expand them. Or, if you try some of the ribbon commands
enumerated in this book, and you just can’t get to them, try expanding the
ribbons and see if that helps. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When to use ribbons to execute commands, versus alternative
ways, will be discussed more extensively in Chapter 3.1.</p>

<h4>2.4.1.2 Drop-Down Menus</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A drop-down menu presents a horizontal list of menu areas
along a menu bar that you Right and Left arrow across. Some common menu areas
are file, edit, and tools. When you press the Up or Down arrow on one of these
menu areas, a list of choices will &quot;drop-down&quot; below that menu area.
Applications discussed in this book which use drop-down menus include JAWS,
Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Adobe Acrobat Reader</p>

<h4><a name="_Toc1629856">2.4.1.3 Context Menus</a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Context menus are activated by pressing the Applications
key. This is roughly equivalent to right clicking for mouse users. On desktop
keyboards, the Applications key is typically the third key to the right of the
Spacebar. For some laptop models, it is the second key to the right of the
Spacebar. Yet nowadays, many laptop keyboards do not have a dedicated
Applications key. Instead, it is necessary to Press Shift F10 to access context
menus. Shift F10 works on any computer, including those with a dedicated Applications
key. </p>

<h4><a name="_Toc1629859">2.4.1.4 Submenus</a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A submenu is a nested menu within another menu. They are
present in numerous Lower ribbons and in context menus accessed via the
Applications key. Unlike dialog boxes, submenus do not have OK and Cancel
buttons. They also have fewer types of controls than dialog boxes, limited
largely to buttons and edit boxes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Submenus encountered in Lower ribbons are opened by either
pressing Enter or the Spacebar. You press the Tab and Shift Tab keys to move
through them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Submenus encountered via the Applications key can be opened
by either pressing Enter or the Right arrow, then using the Up or Down arrow to
move through your choices. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc1629858">2.4.2 Dialog Boxes</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A dialog box is a window that pops up on the screen with
options that you can select. After the selections have been made, you can
typically Tab to an OK button to enter the changes. You can press either the
Cancel button or the Escape key to discard the selections. The computer is
engaging you in a dialogue of sorts. </p>

<h4>2.4.2.1 Dialog Box Elements</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A number of different elements or controls typically appear
in a dialog box. You navigate through the dialog box by pressing Tab to get to
the next control, or Shift Tab to move to the previous one. Your cursor will
eventually wrap around. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you listen carefully, JAWS does a good job of telling you
what element you have landed on and how to navigate it and register
information. NVDA and Narrator do this slightly less well. The elements or
controls you will encounter are listed below:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Radio buttons: Use the Up or Down arrow to make your selection,
and then Press Tab to move to the next element of the dialog box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Edit boxes: Type in text like your name, street address, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Combo boxes: This is a drop-down list. Use the Up or Down arrow
or first-letter nav<a name="_Hlk59386512">igate</a> to your choice. You can
also Press Home or End to move to the first or last choice in the list,
respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Edit combo boxes: A hybrid of edit boxes and combo boxes. You can
Press the first letter, or several letters of your choice, and then use the
Down arrow to quickly navigate to your selection. You can also type in the full
word or number. NVDA and Narrator are less consistent than JAWS in identifying
these, sometimes saying Just “edit” rather than “edit combo.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Edit spin boxes: Use the Up and Down arrow to select a preset
numerical value, or you can type it in manually. Edit spin boxes always involve
numerical values, while edit combo boxes may involve numerical values or words.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Checkboxes: Press the Spacebar to check or uncheck choices.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Left/right sliders: For adjusting percentage values along a
continuum. Press the Left and Right arrow to lower and raise by one percent,
respectively. Press Page down and Page up to raise by a larger percent (ten or
20 percent, depending on the slider), and Home and End to maximize or minimize
the value. An example is adjusting the JAWS Voice rate in the Voice Settings
dialog box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Up/down sliders: For adjusting percentage values along a
continuum. Press the Down and Up arrow to lower and raise by one percent,
respectively. Press Page down and Page up to raise by a larger percent (ten or
20 percent, depending on the slider), and Home and End to maximize or minimize
the value. An example is adjusting the computer’s speaker volume accessed via the
System Tray.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Buttons: Press Enter or Spacebar to activate. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Split buttons: If you Press Enter or Spacebar on a split button,
this will execute the default change. If you Press Alt Down arrow, this will
expand a list and you can choose from several other options using the four
arrow keys. When you navigate to a split button via the ribbons, JAWS will
clearly indicate this, saying “press Alt plus Down arrow for more options.”
NVDA will say “split button collapsed,” but will not prompt you to Press Alt
Down arrow to access more options. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>List views: Contains multiple items such as files or folders,
allowing you to select desired items with the Arrow keys or first-letter
navigation. <a name="_Hlk528946946">The Save As dialog box has a list view for
selecting the folder where you wish to save a file. </a></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tree views: Organizes folders into a hierarchical view allowing
the folder structure of your computer to be represented. Use the Right arrow to
open or expand a folder, the Left Arrow to close or collapse a folder, and the
Up and Down arrow to move within a folder level. The Save As dialog box has a
tree view for navigating the folder hierarchy of your computer.</p>

<h4>2.4.2.2 Multi-page dialog Boxes</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some dialog boxes are split into several pages. One example
is the Paragraph dialog box. With JAWS, you will know if you have landed in a multi-page
dialog box if JAWS says the word “page.” For example, when you land in the
Paragraph multi-page dialog box, you will first hear “indents and spacing
page.” Press Control Tab once and you will hear “line and page breaks page.”
NVDA does not indicate this when you first land in a multi-page dialog box, but
will do so once you start pressing Control Tab.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A variation on multi-page dialog boxes can be found in the
Options dialog box of each of the Office applications, which is situated in the
File tab (shortcut: Alt F T). When you open it, focus starts in a category
list. You can use the Down arrow, or first letter-navigate to the category you
want. When you use the Arrow keys to get to a category, the rest of the dialog
box changes to show the options in the selected category. Do not Press Enter or
Spacebar because this will just exit you from the dialog box. Instead, press
Tab to move through the options as you would in a typical dialog box.</p>

<h2>2.5 Important Initial Settings You May Want to Change</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you just purchased your shiny new computer, there are
several settings you will want to change. The first five in this section are
crucial for making your computer work effectively. These are the factory
defaults related to showing deletion confirmations, unhiding file extensions,
and if you have a laptop, switching the FN key to classic functionality and
disabling the Touchpad. You will also need to connect to the Internet via a
local Wi-fi network. In situations where you need to navigate to the Control
Panel to change some settings, you should change to Large icons view for
remaining steps to work correctly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The remaining items are more a question of personal
preference. </p>

<h3>2.5.1 Showing Deletion Confirmations</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>By default, when you press the Delete key on a selected file
or folder, the files go to the Recycle Bin without any warning. This is
dangerous because you can inadvertently delete files and folders without
knowing it. To turn on the deletion confirmation setting:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Windows M or D to go to the Desktop.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press R until you get to the Recycle Bin icon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow once to Properties, and press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to the Display delete confirmation dialog checkbox and
press the Spacebar to check it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now when you press the Delete key on a file, you should hear
“Delete file dialog, are you sure you want to move this file to the Recycle
Bin?” You land on the Yes button, so press Enter or the Spacebar to confirm. </p>

<h3>2.5.2 Unhiding File Extensions</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A file extension, or Filename extension, is a suffix at the
end of a computer file. It comes after the period and is usually three to four
characters long. File extensions for Microsoft Office versions from 2007 and
newer are: DOCX for Word; XLSX for Excel; and PPTX for PowerPoint. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you receive a new computer, you should change the
default factory setting for showing file extensions which is set as off.
Hearing the file extensions will make it easier to distinguish files from
folders because folders don’t have extensions. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to a folder with lists of folders and files in it. The
Documents folder is a good place to go.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Alt key to open the File Explorer Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow to the View tab on the Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to the Filename extension checkbox and press the
Spacebar to check it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now when you arrow down to a file, you should hear its
extension. </p>

<h3>2.5.3 Switching the FN Key to Classic Function Key Use on a Laptop</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Laptop computer keyboards (and some desktop keyboards) use
the FN key to switch between different uses of the function keys: Classic use
of the F1 to F12 keys; and <span style='color:#404040;background:white'>special
actions related to audio volume, playback, and hardware features. </span>On
most laptop models, the FN key is located just to the right of the lower-left
Control key. However, for many Lenovo laptops, the FN key is the bottom left
key. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Screen reader users need their function keys to be set for
Classic function key use. If this is not the case, you will need to press the
FN key and F1 through F12 in combination with other keys in order to execute
common commands. <span style='color:#404040;background:white'>If, for example,
you attempt to close the current window by pressing Alt F4, tell the time with
Insert F12, or the Spellcheck a Word document with F7, and don’t get the
expected result, chances are that the FN key is set incorrectly. While you can
press the FN key in combination with these keystrokes, it is awkward and
inefficient.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>When you get a
new computer, the function keys may or may not be set for Classic use. If not
set for Classic use, you need to make this switch. </span>Depending on your
laptop model, you may be able to change it by either hitting the FN key
together with the Shift key, the Escape key, or the Caps lock key. Try these
keystroke combinations. Then with any of the three screen readers, try telling
the time by pressing Insert F12. If one of these keystroke combinations works
for switching to Classic function key use, be sure to remember it because you
might mistakenly toggle it off in the future. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If none of these key combinations work for changing FN key
functionality, seek advice from the vendor or manufacturer who sold you the
computer, or the state blindness agency that gave it to you. You may be
required to go into the laptop’s <span style='line-height:107%'>Basic
Input/Output System</span> (BIOS) and change it. <span style='line-height:107%'>The
BIOS is a pre-installed program that the computer uses to start up. It checks
all your hardware connections and locates all your devices. If all is well, the
BIOS loads the operating system into the computer's memory and finishes the
boot-up process. Because the BIOS begins operating before any of the screen
reader programs start up, it is not accessible. You may need sighted assistance
to change FN key functionality. Ideally, this person should be tech savvy,
because going into the BIOS is not something that should be attempted by
novices.</span></p>

<h3>2.5.4 Disabling the Touchpad on a Laptop</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A touchpad is a flat control surface used to move the cursor
and perform other functions on a laptop computer. Located below the Spacebar,
it replaces the functionality of a mouse and is controlled with your finger. By
sliding your fingertip along the surface, you can move the cursor on the
screen. Some touchpads have two rectangular keys below them, which correspond
to the left and right mouse clickers, respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If your touchpad is enabled, it is hard to avoid brushing
your palm over it. This will make your cursor shoot around in a document window
or switch to another window. You will find this annoying and frustrating. To
stop this from happening you will need to disable your touchpad. But it is
important to also know how to reenable it in case you need assistance from a
sighted person. Without resort to a touchpad or mouse, even the most tech-savvy
sighted person will have a hard time helping you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How to disable/enable the Touchpad varies by laptop brand
and model. Fortunately, for many laptop models, it is easy to do. Try the
following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Windows to open the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in the first few letters of touchpad until you hear “Touchpad
settings system settings,” and then press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you land on the Touchpad button and it is switched on, press Enter to
disable it. Then press Alt F4 to exit this window.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To verify that it is disabled, move your fingers around on the Touchpad
or press one of the Touchpad clickers. If nothing happens, then it is disabled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To reenable the Touchpad, repeat the steps above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For some laptop models manufactured by HP, tapping twice
near the upper left corner of the Touchpad toggles it off and on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If none of these disable your touchpad, consult the
manufacturer or the store where you bought it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the worst case scenario, disabling the Touchpad must be
done in the BIOS (see Appendix III for its definition) and this is not
accessible. If you find this out prior to buying a laptop, don’t buy it. In my
opinion, this is a serious enough drawback to disqualify the model from
consideration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have purchased such a laptop, a possible workaround
is to attach a cheap mouse via the USB port. Hopefully you can then find a
setting that overrides and disables the Touchpad when a mouse is connected to
the computer. Just place the mouse somewhere out of the way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes, the Touchpad reenables itself without you having
done anything. If this happens, simply disable it again. </p>

<h3>2.5.5 Connecting to a Wi-Fi Network</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When setting up your computer, one of the first things you
will need to do is to connect to your home Wi-Fi network. If using a laptop and
traveling, you also need to know how to do this to connect to networks in those
other locations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two types of networks: secure networks which are
private and for which a password is required; and public networks, which do not
have passwords. Your home network will be a secure network. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for connecting to a network are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Windows I to get into Windows Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once, Down arrow to Network and Internet, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once, Down arrow to Wi-Fi, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Show available networks link and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow through the list of nearby networks. As you Down arrow, each
network will be designated as either secure or public. Press Enter on the
network to which you want to connect</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Connect automatically checkbox and press the Spacebar to
check it. This avoids having to rejoin the network the next time you turn on
your computer. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Connect button and press Enter. If you are connecting to a
public network, you are done. Press Alt F4 to close the window.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>But if you are connecting to a secure network, you will now be asked to
type in the password for that network. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter after typing in the password. You are now connected to this
secure network. Press Alt F4 to close the window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the name of your desired network does not appear, go to
the bottom of the list, and press Enter on Hidden. Here you can type in the
network name and complete the steps above to connect to it.</p>

<h3>2.5.6 Changing the Control Panel View</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Control Panel is a place where users can modify system
settings and many other things related to operation of the computer. In several
sections of this book, you will be instructed to go to the Control Panel to
change some settings. You should change the Control Panel view to either small
or large icons for remaining steps to work correctly. </p>

<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To change the view:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Windows key to open the Start menu search box, type in the
first few letters of “Control Panel,” and press Enter when you hear it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Category button and press the Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to either the Small icons or Large icons button and press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You will now be able to Down arrow or first-letter navigate
through the list of items (expressed as “links”) and press Enter to activate
them.</p>

<h3>2.5.7 Changing Default Programs</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned earlier in this chapter, procedures for
changing default programs for applications like web browsers and music players
are quick and easy with Windows 10 and more tedious and time-consuming with
Windows 11. I will cover steps for doing this with Windows 10 first. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Among the default applications you can easily change with
Windows 10 are those for Email, audio players, and web browsers. The Windows 10
factory defaults are the native Mail app for Email, Groove Music for music or
audio players, and Edge for web browsers. First, what does it mean for these to
be your default applications?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you press Enter on the link for an email address you find
in the body of an email message, that email address will be placed in the To
field of your default mail program. If you have Outlook on your computer, you
will want to change this from the native Mail app to Outlook. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pressing Enter on a file with an audio extension like MP3,
WAV, or WMA will open that file in the default media player. If you prefer to
use an app other than Groove Music, you can change the default to Windows Media
Player or another popular audio app like WINAMP or VLC if you have installed
these. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Regarding web browsers, Microsoft Edge is the factory
default. The version that came out in January 2020 is fully accessible and
gaining quickly in popularity. That said, you may prefer Google Chrome or
Mozilla Firefox. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that for apps that are not native to Windows 10, you
will need to install them before they can appear as additional default options.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To change these defaults:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Windows Key to open the Start menu, placing focus in the
search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the first few letters of “Default app settings system settings.” As
soon as you hear these words, press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You first land on Email, with the name of the current default app
identified. Again, the factory default is Mail.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter or Spacebar. A pop-up appears. Tab to your new default
choice, presumably Outlook, and press Spacebar to select it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to Music player. Groove Music is the factory default.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter or Spacebar. A pop-up appears. Tab to your new default
choice, and press Spacebar to select it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Web browser. Microsoft Edge is identified here as your default.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter or Spacebar, Tab to your new default choice, and press
Spacebar to select it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F4 to close this window (there is no OK button to activate). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using web browsers as an example, here are the steps for
changing programs with Windows 11. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Windows Key to land in the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the first few letters of “Default app settings system settings.”
When you hear these words, press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to the Set default applications list box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the browser you want for your default. You must Down
arrow. First-letter navigation does not work in this list. Press the Spacebar
on your choice to select it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to HTTP, and Edge will be identified as the current default
if this is the first time you are changing it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Spacebar which opens a pop-up. Tab to your new choice and
press the Spacebar to change the default browser for this. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Set default file types or link types. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to HTTPS and repeat the above step. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Also repeat the above steps for.htm,.html, and any other web-related
file types you use. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While in this settings area, if you plan on using Acrobat
Reader as your default PDF viewer, change your default for this file type too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Follow similar steps if you want to change your default
music player from Groove Music to some other app like Windows Media Player,
WINAMP, or VLC. Common audio File types to change include.MP3,.WAV,.WMA, and a
few others. </p>

<h3>2.5.8 Turning Off the File Path Display in the Title Bar</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>If, for example, you are in the Documents folder and you
press Insert T to hear the title of the window, sometimes the factory default
is to give the full path rather than the name of the folder. For example, your
screen reader may say “C:\Users\David\Documents,” rather than simply
“Documents.” While there are occasions when it is helpful to hear the full file
path, usually it is more verbosity than you prefer to hear. To turn this off in
Windows 10, do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the Documents folder because you first need to be in a list
view of folders and files in order to change the setting. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Alt key to open the Upper ribbon, left arrow once to the File
tab, Down arrow to Options and press Enter. The ribbon shortcut for this is Alt
F O, but it does not work consistently.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Tab once to go to the View Page of this multi-page dialog
box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Advanced settings tree view.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Display the full path in the title bar. If it says “on,”
press the Spacebar to toggle it off.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have turned off the full file path display, but now
want to hear it, you can do this by pressing Alt D to find it on the Address
bar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for turning on or off display of the full path in the
Title bar with Windows 11 are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Alt key to open the Command bar, Right arrow to the More apps
button, and press the Spacebar to expand it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Options and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From here, follow steps 3 through 6 above. </p>

<h3><a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK3"></a><a name="OLE_LINK4"></a><a
name="OLE_LINK7">2.5.9 Turning Off the Backstage View in Office Applications</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Changing this setting is not as critical as some of the ones
above, but you may prefer to do it. When you first open Word, Excel, or PowerPoint,
instead of immediately landing in a blank document, worksheet, or presentation,
you land in something called the “Backstage view.” A list of buttons appears.
You can either press the Spacebar or Escape to get into an environment where
you can start working. But, if instead, you prefer to get right into a blank
document, worksheet, or presentation every time, you can turn off the Backstage
view in each of these applications as follows: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Word, Excel, or PowerPoint, and press the Escape key to get out of
the Backstage view. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F T, which is the shortcut key to get into the Options menu
for each of these applications. Be sure to press these keys separately, not all
together.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in a list of categories, the first one being General, which is
the one you want.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to the Show the start screen when this application
starts checkbox and press the Spacebar to uncheck it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<h3>2.5.10 Enabling the Windows Startup Sound</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>While not entirely necessary, some people long for the days
of Windows 7 when a familiar chime played during startup. For screen reader
users, the chime provides an added layer of assurance that the computer is
starting up properly. In Windows 10, this has been removed as a default
setting. If you want to enable it, steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Windows I to get into Windows Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once, Down arrow to Personalization, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once, Down arrow to Themes, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Windows sounds default button and press the Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow to Windows default, Tab to the Play Windows startup

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now restart your computer to verify that the old familiar
startup sound plays. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want to disable the startup sound, repeat steps one
through four above, uncheck the Play Windows startup sound checkbox, Tab to the
OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For Windows 11, a startup sound has been incorporated by
default, so you don’t need to set it up. </p>

<h2>2.6 File Management Basics</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>File Explorer is the Windows application for file
management. You can use it to navigate through your files and folders, as well
as organize them. </p>

<h3>2.6.1 The Folder Structure of Your Computer</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is important to fully understand the folder structure of
your computer. This knowledge provides the foundation of much that follows.
Understanding your computer’s folder structure will make your life easier for
the following reasons:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You will be less likely to “lose” files when saving them.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You will be more confident when downloading files from the
Internet. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You will be more comfortable managing external devices like thumb
drives and external devices that you use with your computer like Victor Reader
Streams. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You will be more confident using Cloud sharing applications like
Dropbox and OneDrive. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You will be more likely to back up your work onto external
devices once you see how easy it is to do. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You will do a better job of organizing your files into folders so
you can find them more quickly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s now take a tour through the various levels of your
computer’s hard drive. We will do this using a list view of your folders and
files. With a list view, you go down a level by pressing Enter. Within a level,
you can Up and Down arrow, first-letter navigate, and press Home and End to go
to the top and bottom of the list, respectively. To go back up one level, you
can press the Backspace key, Alt Left arrow, or Alt Up arrow.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Begin by pressing the Windows key and typing “This PC” in the search
box. Usually, typing just the first one or two letters suffices to bring this
up. Press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Either Right arrow or Down arrow and you will hear names of several
folders contained in your User folder. Among these are Desktop, Documents,
Downloads, Music, and Pictures.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Stop when you hear Devices and drives. If it also says “collapsed,”
press the Spacebar to expand it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow or Right arrow. Depending on your computer model, you may
hear it say Windows C, O SC, Local Disk C, or something else followed by C.
Whichever it is, all will end with C because the C drive is your computer hard
drive. Remember the first letter so you can use first-letter navigation to get
to it more quickly in the future. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To the right or below of the C drive are listed other drives like a DVD
drive if you have one. You will also hear the names of other drives if you
currently have something connected via one of your USB ports.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on your C drive and this will bring you to the next folder
level. Unless you are a technician, you will never visit most of the folders at
this level. However, a few are worth mentioning. The folders and files that
make up the various programs installed on your computer are located in the
Program Files and Program Files (X86) folders. You may never visit these, but
it can be useful to know where they reside. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Users folder and press Enter to go to the next level
in your folder structure. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A number of individual user folders are listed in this folder. By far
the most important is your own user folder, usually named for you. Press Enter
here to access your user folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow and you will hear the names of about a dozen folders. Among
the most important are:</p>

appear alphabetically from A to Z. Under these, files not in folders are listed
A to Z. We will return to the Documents folder soon and spend some time there.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>12.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Now
press the Backspace key to go back up one level, returning to your User folder,
with cursor focus on Documents. The computer remembers the path you took. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>13.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Backspace
again to ascend to the Users folder with focus on your user folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>14.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Backspace
one more time and you land in the C drive folder with focus on Users.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>Backspace one final time to return
to the This PC folder. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>15.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Press
Alt F4 to exit File Explorer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now repeat the steps, this time going more quickly by using
first-letter navigation. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Begin by pressing the Windows key, typing in the first couple of letters
of This PC and pressing Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the first letter associated with your C drive and then Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press U for Users and then Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the first letter of your User folder name and then Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press D a couple of times until you get to Documents and then press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With regard to ascending up through the folder hierarchy, in
addition to backspacing, you can also press Alt Left arrow or Alt Up arrow.
Backspacing or Alt Left arrowing behave similarly. However, there is a subtle
difference between backspacing/Alt Left arrowing versus Alt Up arrowing.
Pressing Alt Left arrow or Backspace works as described above if you went down
through a folder path to arrive there. However, if you did not follow a folder
path, nothing will happen if you press either of these keystrokes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By contrast, pressing Alt Up arrow will move up a level in
the folder hierarchy, regardless of how you got there in the first place. For
example, if I began by pressing Enter on my desktop shortcut to Dropbox and
then pressed either Alt Left arrow or Backspace, nothing would happen because I
didn’t follow a folder path to get there. But if I pressed Alt Up arrow
instead, this would move me up one level in my folder hierarchy, landing in my
user folder because my Dropbox folder resides there. </p>

<h3>2.6.2 Creating Folders, Selecting, Copying, Cutting and Pasting Files</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You will be more efficient if you get in the habit of
organizing your files in folders. At least initially, you will probably do most
of this work in your Documents folder. As mentioned above, by default, the
Documents folder is sorted alphabetically with folders at the top of the List
view, and files not in folders underneath. You can navigate through the List
view by pressing Home and End to quickly go to the top and bottom of the list,
respectively. You can also up and Down arrow through the list, or first-letter
navigate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To create a new folder, press Control Shift N (or the ribbon
shortcut Alt H N), type in the name, and press Enter. The folder will now be
placed alphabetically within the list of existing folders. If you ever want to
rename it, press F2, edit the text, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Copying or moving files into folders involves three
operations:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Selecting the file or files.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Copying or cutting them to the Clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Navigating to the folder where you want to place them, and then pasting
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Single or multiple files can be selected. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For single files:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow or first-letter navigate to the file you want to copy
or move. Placing focus on it with your cursor selects it. If it is the first
file in the list, and it is not already selected, you can also press the
Spacebar to select it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy the file, or Control X to move it. JAWS will say
“copied or cut selection to clipboard.” NVDA will say “Control C or Control X.”
Narrator will say “C copied or X cut.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the folder where you want to place the file and press Enter
to open it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control V to paste the file. JAWS will say “pasted selection from
clipboard.” NVDA will say “Control V.” Narrator will say “pasted.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To select contiguous files, that is, multiple files that are
above or below each other in the list:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the first file you want to select, as above.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Hold down the Shift key and Down arrow to select the additional files
you want to select. Your screen reader will say “selected” and the names of
these additional files. If you go too far, with the Shift key still held down,
Up arrow and your screen reader will say “unselected.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat the steps above to copy or cut the files and paste them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To select <span style='line-height:107%;color:black;
background:white'>noncontiguous files</span>, that is, selecting some while
skipping over others:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the first file you want to select, as above.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Hold down the Control key and Down arrow past the files you don’t want
to select. Your screen reader will say “not selected” and the file name for
each one you go past.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With the control key still held down, press the Spacebar on those files
you want to select. Your screen reader will say “Control space.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat the steps above to copy or cut the files and paste them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the above two operations, if you let up the Shift or
Control key in the middle of the process, and then start arrowing again, this
unselects everything you have already selected. You will need to start over
again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few other useful file and folder selection keystrokes are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control A: Select all files and subfolders within a folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control Shift Home: Select from the file or folder where your
cursor is focused to the top of the list within a folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control Shift End: Select from the file or folder where your
cursor is focused to the bottom of the list within a folder.</p>

<h3>2.6.3 Deleting Files, Folders, and Using the Recycle Bin</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Periodically clean up your computer by deleting files and
folders you no longer need. This is a two-step process: moving them to the
Recycle Bin and permanently deleting them from inside the Recycle Bin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To move files or folders to the Recycle Bin, select them as
outlined above and press the Delete key. If it is a single file, Your screen
reader will say, “Delete file dialog, are you sure you want to move this file
to the Recycle Bin?” Press the Spacebar to confirm. If you have selected
multiple files, your screen reader will say the number of files selected. If
you are deleting folders, your screen reader will indicate that they are
folders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you press the Delete key and the files simply go away
without any deletion confirmation message, be sure to turn this deletion
confirmation setting on following the steps outlined in Chapter 2.5.1. If you
leave this turned off, you risk inadvertently deleting files and folders
without knowing it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can permanently delete files and folders in the Recycle
Bin. You can also restore files and folders to their original location if you
mistakenly delete them. However, note that if you delete files and folders from
an external device such as a thumb drive, they will be permanently deleted. You
can’t get them back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To access the Recycle Bin, press Windows M or D to go to the
Desktop, press R to get to the Recycle Bin icon, and press Enter. To
permanently delete individual files or folders, down or Up arrow to that file
or folder and press the Delete key. Your screen reader will ask you if you want
to permanently delete this file or folder. Press the Spacebar to confirm. Press
Control A to select all files and folders if you want to empty the Recycle Bin,
and then press Enter to confirm. You can also empty it by pressing the
Applications key on its Desktop icon, Down arrowing to Empty Recycle Bin, and
pressing Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want to restore a deleted file or folder to its
original location, Down arrow to that file or folder and press Enter. You land
on a Restore button. Press Enter or Spacebar to confirm. Then press the Escape
key to return to the Recycle Bin.</p>

<h3>2.6.4 Folder Views</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you open most folders with a list of files in them, by
default, subfolders within that folder are sorted alphabetically by name at the
top of the list, with files not in folders sorted alphabetically below the
subfolders.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[4]</span></span></span></a>
There are also various views for arranging files and folders. Views include
details, list, tiles, content, small, medium large, and extra large icons. I
will largely limit discussion to the Details and Large Icons Views.</p>

<h4>2.6.4.1 Details View</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>For most folders, or more precisely, for folders primarily
containing documents and audio files (as opposed to pictures or videos), the
default View is the Details View, and it is generally the most useful and
accessible one. For folders containing primarily documents, this view not only
displays the filename, but also the date it was last saved or revised. For
folders containing primarily audio files, This view displays the filename, and
music-related information like title, contributing artists, and album. For this
information to be meaningful, it assumes the file’s author has properly tagged
it to include this information. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The List view is also accessible, but only provides the file
name. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is best to start in the Documents folder to examine the
Details view. To view this information:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to a file. You will hear the filename with its extension,
assuming it is set to hear the file extension (see Chapter 2.5.2). </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow once to hear the date and time the file was last modified.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow again to hear the file type.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow one last time to hear the file size in kilobytes or
megabytes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Knowing when a file was last modified can be useful for
verifying that you are working on the latest version of a document, or that it
saved properly the last time you revised it. Knowing the size of a file can be
useful if you are thinking of attaching it to an email message and there is a
size limit on attachments, or you want to clean up your folders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you arrow up or down to a folder, you can Right arrow to
hear the date modified and that the type is “folder.” However, you will not
hear its size. With NVDA and JAWS, you can also get the size information by
checking its properties. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With your cursor focus on the folder, press the Applications
key, Up arrow once to Properties, and press Enter. With NVDA, one of the types
of information you will hear is the size of the folder. With JAWS, once you
start hearing various properties spoken, press Insert B and you will also hear
the folder size. As far as I know, it is not possible to detect folder size
with Narrator. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also access Properties by pressing Alt and Enter
together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, you can change the information provided in the
Details View. I often do this in folders predominantly made up of audio files
because I don’t find the displayed items very useful. Default items in the
Details view are name, number, title, contributing artist, and album. Unless I
am organizing a music database, the only item I consider of any use is the name
of the file. I would like to hear the date of the file and its size, but these
do not appear by default. The quickest way to have the same information
displayed in the Details view for documents is as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor focus on the folder where you want to change the
elements displayed in the Details view.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, up arrow once to Properties, and press Enter
(shortcut for Properties is Alt Enter).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Control Tab to the Customize page of this multi-page dialog. You land on
the Optimize this folder for combo box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow to Documents.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Also apply this template to all subfolders checkbox and press
the Spacebar if you want this version of the Details view to apply to
subfolders.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<h4>2.6.4.2 Large Icons View</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The default view for folders made up predominantly of
pictures and videos is the Large Icons view. This is useful for sighted
computer users because it allows them to preview pictures and photos by seeing
an image of it. This view is of little use to screen reader users with limited
or no usable vision. Moreover, this view can be confusing if you are unaware of
it. Filenames are arranged in a grid which means that if you up and Down arrow,
you will only hear the first file in a row of files, thus failing to detect
most of them. The other icon views (small, medium, and extra large) behave in a
similar fashion. To detect all the files, right and left arrow instead of up
and Down arrowing. If you Right arrow, when you reach the end of a row, it will
wrap around to the next row. You can also switch to the Details View and then
up or Down arrow through the list of files. </p>

<h4>2.6.4.3 Changing Views</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>With Windows 10, to switch from the Large icons view to the
Details view:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in the folder with pictures or videos, press Alt to open the Upper
ribbon in Windows File Explorer. You should first land on the Home tab. If
instead, you land on the File tab, this means that your ribbons are not
maximized. Press Control F1 to do this. Otherwise,  the remaining steps will
not work.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You should first land on the Home tab. If instead, you land on the File
tab, this means that your ribbons are not maximized. Press Control F1 to do
this. Otherwise,  the remaining steps will not work.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From the Home tab, Right arrow twice to the View tab on the Upper
ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon to the Layout Toolbar change your view
drop-down. It will also say Large Icons, indicating that this is the current
view for the folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter which opens a grid with several rows of choices. If you Down
arrow once, and then Right arrow once, you should land on Details (your screen
reader program says “details grid”). If this does not get you there, try
different combinations of the four arrow keys to find it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on Details grid to switch to that view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can make this the default view for all folders
containing files of this type as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in this same folder after having change the view, press the Alt
key to open the Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Left arrow to the File Tab, Down arrow to Options, and press Enter. The
shortcut key is Alt F O, but it does not work consistently. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Tab once to go to the View Page of this multi-page dialog
box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The first place you land, your screen reader will say “You can apply
this view to all folders (such as details or large icons) to all folders of
this type, apply to folders button.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Spacebar and you will be asked “Do you want all folders of
this type to match this folder's view settings?”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Spacebar on the Yes button to confirm.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While this seems to work for changing from one view to
another, it does not seem to work for permanently changing the items shown in
the Details view. When I have tried to permanently do this for folders with
audio files, the changes do not remain saved. You may get better results by
using the method I outlined above for changing the elements displayed in the
Details view for individual folders and their subfolders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To switch from the Large icons view to the Details view
using Windows 11:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in the folder with pictures or videos, press Alt to open the
Command bar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow to the View button and press the Spacebar to expand it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Details and press the Spacebar to switch to this view. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To make this the default view for all folders containing
files of this type, steps in Windows 11 are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in this same folder after having change the view, press the Alt
key to open the Command bar, Right arrow to the More apps button, and press the
Spacebar to expand it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Options and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This opens a multi-page dialog box. Press Control Tab once to go to the
View Page of this multi-page dialog box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The first place you land, your screen reader will say “You can apply
this view to all folders (such as details or large icons) to all folders of
this type, apply to folders button.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Spacebar and you will be asked “Do you want all folders of
this type to match this folder's view settings?”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Spacebar on the Yes button to confirm. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<h4>2.6.4.4 Sorting Files Within Views</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned at the beginning of this section, by default,
folders are sorted alphabetically by name at the top of the list, with files
not in folders sorted alphabetically below the folders. You can change this to
sort by type of file, size of file and various other criteria. You can also
sort by ascending and descending order. For example, the default for sorting by
name is ascending, or in other words, alphabetically by folder and file name
from A to Z. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With Windows 10, to change the sort criteria while in a
given folder:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, Right arrow to the View tab, Tab to
the Sort by drop-down, and press Enter. Remember to have your ribbons maximized
by first pressing Control F1.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow through the options and press the Spacebar on the sorting
criterion you would like to switch to. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you want to switch between ascending and descending, it is quicker to
Up arrow and press the Spacebar to make this change. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may have had the experience of opening a folder and for
some mysterious reason unknown to you, discovering that the folder is “upside
down,” with the Z files at the top of the list and the A files at the bottom.
Use the Sort By drop-down to change from descending order back to ascending. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I sometimes temporarily change to sort by type, if I want to
bunch all my Excel, Word, or PDF files in one place. Then I change back to sort
by name, keeping this as my default.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To change the sort criteria while in a given folder with
Windows 11:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Command bar, Right arrow to the Sort button, and
press the Spacebar to expand it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow through the options and press the Spacebar on the sort
criterion you would like to switch to. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you want to switch between ascending and descending, it is quicker to
Up arrow and press the Spacebar to make this change. </p>

<h4>2.6.4.5 Folder Tree Views </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A tree view organizes folders into a hierarchical view
allowing you to navigate through folder levels from left to right. However,
unlike list views, tree views cannot be used to navigate to and open individual
files. Common places where you encounter them include the Save As dialog box
for saving files, the Outlook folder structure, and JAWS Help topics.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moving from left to right, the tree view hierarchy is
displayed as levels 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Use the Right arrow to open or
expand a tree view level, the Left Arrow to close or collapse it, and the Up
and Down arrow to move within a tree view level.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc1629861">2.7 Text Reading, Navigatio</a>n and Editing</h2>

<h3>2.7.1 Reading and Navigation</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following keystrokes are used for reading and navigating
text in the body of Word documents, Outlook messages, and pages on the
Internet. Where JAWS, NVDA, and Narrator keystrokes differ, this is noted. </p>

if you select text and then hit, say, a letter, the selected text will be
replaced by that letter. Ditto for pressing the Spacebar, Tab, and a number of
other keys. If you do this mistakenly, immediately Press Undo (Control Z) to
cancel this keystroke and restore your selected text. </p>

<h3>2.7.3 Understanding Cursor Logic When Editing</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When deleting and inserting individual characters, it is
important to understand the logic of cursor behavior. Knowing how your screen
reader talks to you when doing this will help you avoid frustration, as well as
make you more efficient and productive. TO get a sense of cursor behavior and
the resulting screen reader feedback, do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the word “chat,” minus the quotes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Left arrow back until you hear the letter C.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Delete key. You will hear the letter H. You have removed the
letter C, and the word “hat” remains.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Position your cursor on the letter A and press the letter E. This places
this letter before the letter A, now giving you the word “heat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Backspace key removes the character before the announced
character. Do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place the cursor on the letter E in “heat.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Backspace key. You will hear the letter H which you have just
deleted, leaving the word “eat.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many people, including me, are more comfortable backspacing
out characters because it is more intuitive to hear the character you are
removing rather than the character just after the one you deleted. Whichever
your preference, the important thing is to understand the cursor logic and what
your screen reader is saying to you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here’s another little cursor idiosyncrasy worth
understanding. If you are now left with the word “eat on the line, you might
logically think there is no way to place text after the T in “eat.” After all,
T is the last character on the line, so if you arrow to that letter and all new
text goes before the T, how can you possibly place text after the letter T? The
answer is that, after typing “eat,” a carriage return code is automatically
placed after it. Right arrow once past the letter T and your screen reader will
say something sounding like “blank.” Because this carriage return code is
present, you can continue typing, for example, adding the letters I N G to
compose the word “eating.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also select text and type replacement text over it.
If I have misspelled a word, rather than do the individual character editing
steps above, I often find it quicker to select that entire word with Control
Shift Right arrow and then retype the correct word right over it. One other
thing: note that when you select a word, the space just after the word is also
selected, so edit accordingly, to be sure the right number of spaces are
present after the word.</p>

<h2>2.8 Opening Applications and Individual Files</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are numerous ways to open applications and individual
files. One way to open an application installed on your computer is to press
the Windows key to bring up the Start menu where you first land in a search box.
Begin typing the name of the application until you hear its full name. Then
press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To open an existing file previously created in an
application, navigate to that file in whichever folder it is located and press
Enter. The file will open in its default program. Files with a.docx file
extension will open in Word, files with a.xlsx extension will open in Excel,
and files with a.PPTX extension will open in PowerPoint. </p>

<h3>2.8.1 Desktop Shortcuts for Files, Folders and Applications</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can create shortcuts for files, folders, applications,
and web pages, enabling you to quickly open these items from the Desktop. I
will cover the first three here. See Chapter 7.8 on how to do this for web pages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for creating desktop shortcuts are the same for
individual files and folders:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the file or folder for which you want to create a shortcut,
but do not open it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow a number of times to the Send To submenu and press Enter or
the Right arrow to open it. Alternatively, after pressing the Applications key,
press N to get into this submenu more quickly. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Desktop create shortcut, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To verify, press Windows D or Windows M to go to the Desktop and
first-letter navigate to the new shortcut. It will have the name of your file
or folder followed by “-shortcut.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To edit the shortcut, press F2 which is the Rename keystroke. When
finished editing, press the Enter key to retain your edits. Press Escape
instead if you do not want to keep the edits.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To create a desktop shortcut for an application:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Windows key and type in the name of the application until you
hear its full name. Do not press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='page-break-after:avoid'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Press the
Applications key, Down arrow to Open file location and press Enter. This places
your cursor on the shortcut file for opening the application. This file is
buried deep in your Programs folder, a place that would be very difficult to
find otherwise. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key again, arrow down to the Send To submenu and
press Enter or the Right arrow to open it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Desktop create shortcut, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To verify, press Windows D or Windows M to go to the Desktop and
first-letter navigate to the shortcut</p>

<h3>2.8.2 Creating Shortcut Keys for Opening Programs</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you have added a desktop shortcut for a program, you
can also define a shortcut key, also referred to as a hotkey, for quickly
opening that program from anywhere on the computer. This hotkey will be a
combination of Control Alt plus some letter or number you add. However, avoid
choosing a key combination that will conflict with key combinations used in
other contexts. For example, if you chose Control Alt 1 for some application,
you will no longer be able to use that key combination in Word for creating a
level one heading or in Outlook for switching to the Day View in the Outlook
calendar. Also avoid Control Alt N because this is the hotkey for opening NVDA.
Also be aware that if you delete the Desktop shortcut for that program, the
hotkey will no longer work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have ever created the Control Alt J hotkey for
starting JAWS, the procedure is exactly the same for other programs. We will
use Word as an example, setting the hotkey as Control Alt W. If you already
have a shortcut for Word on the Desktop, do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Windows M or Windows D to go to the Desktop.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press W to go to the Word Icon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow to Properties, and press Enter.
This opens the Shortcut page of the Word Properties dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab twice to the Shortcut key edit box, and type in the letter W
(Control and Alt will automatically be added).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If a Continue button appears, press the Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You should now be done. However, if you do not have
administrative rights, you will also have to Enter the administrator’s password
after pressing the Continue button.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now press Control Alt W from anywhere on the computer and
Word should open.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you do not have a shortcut for Word on your Desktop, do
the following instead:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Windows key and begin typing in “Word” until you hear its full
name. Do not press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to Open file location and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat steps 3 through 6 above to define the hotkey. </p>

<h2>2.9 Saving Office Documents</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Rule Number One of document preparation is to save early and
often. Some people mistakenly think that saving is the last thing you do after
typing the text, spellchecking, and editing. This is a recipe for potential
disaster. Follow this path and your own goof ups, inexplicable crashes, your
screen reader abruptly going silent for no apparent reason, and other acts of
God could cause you to lose hours of work. Get into the habit of doing an
initial save just a couple of minutes into working on your document. When you
pause to take a breath, reflexively press Control S to update your save. Now
when your computer misbehaves, the worst outcome is that you have lost a couple
of minutes of work, rather than a couple of hours or more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For Word documents, Excel workbooks and PowerPoint
presentations, initial file saving is performed in the Save as dialog box. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To perform an initial save, press F12 to open this dialog
box. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You land in an edit field where a filename is proposed,
appearing as follows for each of the three Office Suite programs:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Word: the Filename edit field is prepopulated with a proposed
filename, including the entire first line or a segment of that line, followed
by the default.docx extension. If you are happy with this, press Enter and the
file will be saved to your default folder for saving documents, usually the
Documents folder. If you wish to give the file another name, simply type over
the proposed name and press Enter to save it to the default folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>PowerPoint: the Filename edit field is prepopulated with a
proposed filename, which is the text you have inserted in the Title placeholder
of the Title slide, followed by the default.pptx extension. Here too, if you
are happy with this, press Enter and the file will be saved to your default
folder for saving documents. Otherwise, type in a new title and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Excel: the Filename edit field is prepopulated with a generic
filename (Book1, Book2, etc.), followed by the default.xlsx extension. You will
want to rename this, typing over the prepopulated text to give it a filename
reflecting the file’s content. Pressing Enter then saves it to the default
folder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If instead of saving to the default folder, you want to save
the file to a subfolder of the default folder, after pressing F12 press Shift
Tab twice to get to a list view of these subfolders. Now Down arrow or
first-letter navigate to the subfolder where you want to save the file. Press
Enter to get into it. Now press Tab twice to go back to the filename edit field
where you first landed in the Save As dialog box. Press Enter and the file will
be saved in this subfolder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a couple of other useful places in the Save as
dialog box worth examining. After landing in the Filename edit field, Shift Tab
three times to land in a tree view which you can navigate through Using the
keystrokes mentioned earlier in this chapter. Begin Right arrowing through the
various tree view levels to see where your file is located. This can be useful
if you are currently in the file and can’t remember exactly where you saved it.
The tree view maps the folder path. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also use the tree view to quickly save the file to
another folder on your computer other than the Documents folder or one of its
subfolders. For example, let’s say you want to save the file to the Music
folder. Do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press F12 to open the Save as dialog box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab several times to the tree view. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press M until you hear “music,” and press Enter. You may hear “enter,”
or you may hear nothing at all, but this locks it in. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the List view of folders and files contained in the Music
folder. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you want to save your file to one of the subfolders in the Music
folder, Down arrow or first-letter navigate to that folder and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you simply want to save your file to the Music folder, and not to any
of its subfolders, ignore the step above.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Filename edit box where you first landed after opening the
Save as dialog box, and press Enter to save the file in this new location. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also save files in formats other than the default
format. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press F12 to open the Save as dialog box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Save as type combo box, and Down arrow to your file
format selection. File type choice options differ from one application to the
next.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab once back to the Filename edit box (where your new file
extension has been added to replace the default extension) and press Enter to
save it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the initial save, press Control S to save any
subsequent changes you have made in the document. As stressed above, save early
and often. Make frequent updating into a reflex. It’s your best defense against
losing large amounts of work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you start working on a document, and want to exit it
without saving it, press Alt F4 and then Alt N. This will close the document
window without saving it.</p>

<h3>2.10 Tips for Finding “Lost Files”</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You will be less apt to lose files if you understand the
folder structure of your computer and are comfortable navigating the Save as
dialog box. Yet, even then, there will be times when you simply cannot remember
the name of a file you created a few days ago, or you have forgotten where you
saved it. Here are a couple of ways to retrieve these hard-to-find files. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you can remember one or two words in the filename, open
the Start menu and type in those words in the Search field. Note that typing
upper or lower case letters does not matter when performing searches. If you
are lucky, the entire filename will populate the search box. If it does not,
Down arrow through the various categories (which, depending on the words you
have typed in, may include find results on the web, in folders, apps, and
others), until you arrive at Find results in documents. If you find the file
here, press Enter if you want to open it. If instead of opening the file, you
would just like to know its location on your computer, with Windows 10, you can
Right arrow once, Down arrow to Open file location, and then press Enter. This
will place your focus on the file where it is situated in your folders. You can
now press Insert T to hear the name of the folder where it is located. You can
also press Alt D to go to the Address bar and hear its full folder path. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that the Open file location option is not currently
available in Windows 11 for files. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition, after Right arrowing in the Start menu, you can
Down arrow just below the Open file location choice to copy the file path to
the Clipboard and press Enter on it. You can then open Word or some other text
editor and paste the full file path there. For example, I searched for a
meatball recipe on my computer and was able to paste the following file path:
“C:\Users\david\Dropbox\Training files\Recipe for Meatballs.docx.” This works
with both Windows 10 and 11. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you cannot remember anything about the filename, in Word,
Excel, and PowerPoint, you can find recently used files as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the relevant Office application, press Alt F R to open the Open file
dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to Pin files you want to easily find later.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow through the files, which are listed chronologically starting
with the most recently opened file at the top of the list.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on the desired file if you want to open it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or press the Applications key, where there are additional
choices, including, open file location, open a copy, delete file, copy path to
clipboard, and a few others.</p>

<h2>2.11 Identifying the Current Version of Your Software</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are having a problem with a specific software
application, you will want to know what version you are using before asking for
help. That will be the first question any technical support person will ask
you. There are various ways to find out this information. Some work better than
others depending on what screen reader you are using, or for which software
application you are trying to identify the version. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Windows 10 updates every spring and fall with a new build.
To find out which Windows 10 semi-annual build you are using, press the Windows
key, type in “winver” minus the quotes, and press Enter. You will then hear
“Microsoft version 20H2” if you are using the Fall 2020 version. Or you may
instead hear 2004 (Spring 2020), 1909 (Fall 2019), or 1903 (Spring 2019). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are using JAWS, with focus in the window for a
particular application, press Control Insert V and JAWS will indicate the
version of that software. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>However, Control Insert V works poorly for identifying your
Microsoft Office version. The information given is vague. Instead, from inside
any of the Office Suite applications, press the keys Alt F D A consecutively.
This brings you into the About Account section of the File Tab and clearly
identifies your version of Office. For example, if you are in Word and press
this keystroke combination, you will hear “Word 365, Word 2016 or Word 2019,”
clearly indicating which version you are running.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To find out your JAWS version, get into the JAWS menus using
any of the approaches identified in Chapter 1.2 and then press H (for the Help

<p class=MsoNormal>This chapter covers the basics of formatting Word documents.
Much of the text is drawn from my 2019 book entitled “Format Your Word
Documents with JAWS and NVDA: A Guide for Students and Professionals.” It is
available from the National Braille Press Book Store. The web address is <a

<p class=MsoNormal>I begin with an overview of the ribbon menus. This section
is relevant for all Office applications. The chapter covers all basic document
formatting areas, as well as some more intermediate-level topics. It also
discusses saving documents with the Save As dialog box and some other useful
tools. Spellchecking and proofreading are covered in Chapter 9.</p>

<h2>3.1 Ribbons in Word and When to Use Them</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>A general overview of Ribbon menu structure and navigation
was presented in Chapter 2.6.1.1. Here are more specifics on the Word ribbons.
Word Upper ribbon tabs (and shortcut keys for getting to them more quickly)
include:</p>

</span></span>Help (Alt Y)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A number of context-specific tabs will also appear when you
format tables, pictures, and various other things. For example, if your cursor
is situated in a table and you press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, as you press
Right arrow two additional Table Tools tabs will appear: a Design tab and a
Layout tab. These two tabs contain commands specific to table formatting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Toc1629857">When should you use the ribbon menus? </a>The
short answer to this question is “it depends.” First, some background, and
then, a couple of examples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why was the ribbon structure introduced in the first place?
The answer has some bearing on strategies for how screen reader users access
commands. For sighted users, many more commands are readily visible in the
Lower ribbon than in a typical menu bar with a drop-down menu. This is because
of the horizontal layout of the Lower ribbon. Over 40 commands are readily
visible in the Lower ribbon of the Home tab. So many commands cannot fit onto
the screen for a drop-down menu, which is a narrow vertical strip. While a
sighted user can easily point and click on whatever command icon they wish to
activate, the screen reader user may be required to press Tab many times to get
to the same place. This means that, at least for some commands, learning the
shortcut key or accessing a command via the Applications key is a better
choice. It depends on the command and how often you think you will use it. To
tease out the pros and cons of using the ribbons, the options for accessing the
Font dialog box and the Margins submenu are good examples.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Font dialog box can be accessed in three ways: In the
Home tab Lower ribbon; via the Applications key context menu for Word; and by
pressing the shortcut key. I will talk about these options from the least
efficient to the most efficient in terms of numbers of keystrokes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The least efficient way to access the Font dialog box is
through the ribbon menus. This involves:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Pressing Alt to access the ribbon menus, either landing on the Home tab
or Pressing the Left arrow one or more times if you land elsewhere on the Upper
ribbon. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Pressing Control Right arrow twice to get to the Font group.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Pressing Tab about 15 times to get to the Font dialog box launcher and
Pressing Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This totals about 20 keystrokes, which is not very
efficient. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A far quicker way to get to the Font dialog box is to go in
via the Applications key as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, or Shift F10 if your keyboard does not have
an Applications key.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Down arrow several times to get to Font and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This totals only four keystrokes, clearly preferable to the
ribbon option. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The shortcut key for accessing the Font dialog box is
Control D, which is obviously the most efficient way to navigate into the Font
dialog box. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By definition, shortcut keys are always the most efficient
way to execute a command. Does this mean that you should use up lots of brain
cells to memorize loads of shortcut keys? Probably not. If you rarely change
your fonts, remembering that the Font dialog box can be found by pressing the
Applications key and the Down arrow just a couple of times is fine. If,
however, you think you will frequently change fonts, it is probably worth it to
memorize the shortcut key. More details on changing fonts are found in Chapter
3.2.2 below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now let’s talk about margins. These can be changed via the
ribbons or the shortcut key. They do not appear in the context menu, the
Applications key is not an option. The shortcut key is Alt P M. To navigate
there via the ribbons, do the following: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you land on the Home tab, Right arrow three times to get to the
Layout tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab once to get to the Margins submenu and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This totals six keystrokes. Because the Margins submenu
happens to be the first stop in the Layout tab’s Lower ribbon, it is relatively
painless to access the Margins submenu via the ribbons. This is clearly not the
case for the Font dialog box launcher, which is located much deeper in the
Lower ribbon of the Home tab.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>More details on changing margins can be found in Chapter
3.2.4 below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For any command you want to execute, you will want to
consider the following questions in deciding whether to access it via the
ribbons, Applications key, or shortcut key:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>How many keystrokes are required to navigate to the command in
the ribbon menus?</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Is the command present in the context menu accessed via the
Applications key or by pressing Shift F10?</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>How easy is it to memorize the shortcut key?</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>How frequently will you use the command?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you gain experience formatting Word documents, more and
more shortcut keys will eventually lodge themselves in your memory. And based
on how often you use various commands, you will also figure out what is the
best choice for you.</p>

name="_Toc40521503">3.2 Formatting </a>Basics</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This section covers the basic requirements for properly
formatting the body of a Word document. If you are comfortable with these
commands, you are well on your way to creating professional-looking documents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A number of the most important formatting commands are
located in the Font and Paragraph dialog boxes. I will start with these.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc1629867">3.2.1 Format Checking with Insert F</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Insert F (F for “format”) is a valuable keystroke in both
JAWS and NVDA for identifying a number of the most important elements of font
and paragraph formatting. You will first hear information on font formatting,
and then paragraph formatting. With Narrator, Insert F provides font formatting
information only, not paragraph formatting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Font-related formatting information you will hear includes:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Attributes (bold, italics, underline)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Font name (Arial, Times New Roman, etc.) </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Color foreground and background (black on white, etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph-related formatting information you will hear with
JAWS and NVDA includes:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Line spacing (single space, double space, etc.)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Indentation (if any)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alignment (left, center, right, or justify)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you press Insert F in a Word document without first
selecting text, you will hear formatting information associated with your
cursor point only. If you move your cursor elsewhere in the document, the
formatting might very well be different there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you first select some text, and then press Insert F, you
will hear formatting information for the selected text. However, if formatting
is not uniform throughout the selection, you might hear things like “mixed
point size,” “mixed font,” “mixed alignment,” and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before making font and paragraph format changes, you should
always press Insert F to hear your current formatting. After making changes,
you should verify by pressing Insert F again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are new to using this keystroke, the amount of
information read to you all at once can be overwhelming. With both JAWS and
NVDA, if you hold down the Insert key and then press F twice, you can press the
Up and Down arrows to read each font and paragraph format setting separately.
When finished, press the Escape key. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc1629868">3.2.2 Font Dialog Box</a> </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the best ways to
access the Font dialog box are to either use the shortcut key (Control D) or
press the Applications key, use the Down arrow to move to Font, and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can change many things in this dialog box, but we will
limit ourselves to the font name, attributes, point size, and color. Here are
the steps:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the text for which you want to change font formatting. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control D to open the Font dialog box (or access it via the
Applications key).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This lands you in the Font edit combo box. Type the first letter of the
font name you want and press the Down arrow until you hear your font choice
(you can also type in the first few letters or the entire name of the font).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Font style edit combo box. Use the Up or Down arrow to
choose either Regular, Italic, Bold, or Bold Italic.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Size edit combo box. Use the Up or Down arrow to choose
your point size choice or type in the point size you want. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter if these are the only formatting changes you want to make. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert F to verify that your choices have registered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you also want to change the color of your text, Tab once
past the Size edit combo box to the Color button. Press the Spacebar, which
brings you into a color picker palette.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The color palette is navigated as follows. If you press Home
or the Up arrow as far as you can, your screen reader will say “automatic,”
which means that the foreground color is black. If you now press the Down arrow
once, you will land on a color and hear “accent 1,” “accent 2,” etc. These
“accents” are different shades of that color, moving from lighter to darker
shades. You can Right and Left arrow to find other colors. If you simply want
black, either press the Up arrow until you hear “automatic,” or press Home
once. When you hear the color you want, press Enter. Do not press the Spacebar
(even though your screen reader program may tell you to do so) because it will
not get you out of the color picker. Now press Tab quite a few times to get to
the OK button and press Enter or Spacebar to make the change. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Be sure to press Insert F to check your work. Note that
different versions of JAWS will announce color information differently. JAWS
2021 says “black on white.” But with earlier versions, you may hear “default on
default,” and even “black on black,” which is of course nonsensical. Unless you
have changed the default foreground and background colors, which you should not
do for normal text, black text on a white background is the default.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although you can bold and italicize text via the Font dialog
box, this is done more easily with shortcut keys. First, select the text you
want to change. Useful shortcut keys are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control B: Bold on/off</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control I: Italicize on/off</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control U: Underline on/off</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are toggles. If text is already bolded, pressing
Control B will turn bolding off. Your screen reader will say “bold off” or
“bold on.” Ditto for italicizing and underlining. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc1629869">3.2.3 Paragraph Dialog Box</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most important formatting options here include: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alignment (left, center, right, justify)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Left and right indentation</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Special, which refers to indenting the first line of every
paragraph, as well as hanging indentation</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Before and After paragraph spacing</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Line spacing (single or double being the most common)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are other options in this dialog box, but we will
limit ourselves to the ones listed above. Here goes!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, select the text for which you want to change
paragraph formatting. If you want to do this for the entire document, press
Control A to select all the text. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Paragraph dialog box launcher is found in the Home tab,
but similar to the Font dialog box, navigating to it is not worth the trouble.
Instead, use either the shortcut key (Alt H P G) or open the context menu with
the Applications key, Down arrow to Paragraph, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first place you land is the Alignment combo box. You can
use the Down and Up arrow to move between the four choices. These are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Left: Places text flush against the left margin. This is the
default.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Center: Centers text on the line. You may want to use this for
titles and some section headings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Right: Places text flush against the right margin. You will
rarely, if ever, use this. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Justify: Places text flush against both the left and right
margins. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After Up or Down arrowing to move to your choice, Tab to
Left Indent. If you want to indent an entire paragraph, or several paragraphs,
press the Up or Down arrow to move to the desired value or type it in (usually
0.5 inches).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Press Tab once to get to Right Indent and enter your value
in the same way as for Left Indent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tab to Special where the default choice is None. Down arrow
once to get to First line if you want to indent the first line of every
paragraph. Now press Tab once and you will hear “0.5,” or in other words, one
half inch. You can use the Up or Down arrow to change this, but the default is
one half inch, and you will usually leave it this way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People often manually press Tab once on the first line of
every paragraph, or even worse, press the Spacebar five times. Other than the
time-consuming nature of doing this, if you are visually impaired and move some
of your text around while editing, you might unwittingly scatter some of these
tabs and random spaces inside your paragraphs. Indenting the first line in the
Paragraph dialog box is a more efficient and cleaner way to do this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now press Tab until you hear “before.” You may also hear “0
point” because for Normal text, 0 point (or no spacing), is the default Before
paragraph spacing. You should not change this for normal text. In the
discussion of headings and styles below, we will see that, by default, Before
paragraph spacing is more than 0 point for headings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now press Tab until you hear “after.” This comes by default
from the factory as either 8 or 10 point. As 11 or 12 point is the typical size
of regular print for sighted readers, 8 or 10 point translate to a tiny bit
less than a full blank line of spacing after each paragraph. If you want to
remove any built-in spacing between paragraphs, change this by Up or Down
arrowing to 0 point. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Blind screen reader users need to keep one important
consideration in mind. Many of us (myself included) press Enter twice when they
end a paragraph: The first Enter is the usual hard return anybody does at the
end of a paragraph. The second hard return is to manually place a blank line
between one paragraph and the next one. This makes it easier for the blind user
to distinguish when one paragraph ends and another one begins because the
screen reader program says “blank” for the empty line between paragraphs. If
this is your practice, continue doing it. However, be sure to set your After
paragraph spacing at 0 point. If you fail to make this adjustment, you will be
putting excessive spacing between paragraphs—the 8 or 10 point spacing from the
factory in addition to the 11 or 12 point spacing you add when you press Enter
that second time. Be sure to avoid making this unsightly error.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now Tab to the Line spacing combo box. This is set to single
spacing by default. If you want to change to double spacing, press the Down
arrow twice to Double.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now Tab to the OK button and press Enter or Spacebar to make
these changes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It’s always a good idea to confirm your changes have
registered by pressing Insert F again. After hearing the font information, and
if you have made some of the paragraph formatting changes I mentioned above,
your screen reader will say something like “line spacing double, first line
indented by zero point five inches, alignment left.” To check Before and After
paragraph spacing, you have two choices. You can return to the Paragraph dialog
box and press Tab to go through and see if your chosen values are still there.
Or you can navigate to the Before and After paragraph spacing options in the
Layout tab of the ribbon. Shortcut keys for these are Alt P S B and Alt P S A,
respectively. </p>

<h3>3.2.4 Setting Margins</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A margin is the blank space between the physical edge of a
page and where print begins. In Word, default margin dimensions are one inch
from the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the page. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To know what your current margins are with JAWS, you can
press Insert F1, which brings up a virtual viewer with Screen-Sensitive Help.
You will hear a lot of information, and eventually the left, right, top, and
bottom margin dimensions. If JAWS speaks too fast for you to hear the margins,
you can use your Up and Down arrow to read the text line by line. When
finished, be sure to press Escape to exit JAWS Screen-Sensitive Help and return
to the document. If you are reading this book electronically in Word, press
Insert F1 now to hear the margin dimensions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neither NVDA nor Narrator have such a help tool, so you need
to get into the Margins submenu to detect your current settings. We’ll see how
this is done in a moment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can access the Margins submenu via the ribbons or use
the shortcut key (Alt P M). Margins are the first stop on the Lower ribbon of
the Layout tab, so when you use the Right or Left arrow to get to the Layout
tab, press Tab just once to land on the Margins command, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You will now hear “last custom margins settings” or
“normal.” Normal is one inch all around. As you press Tab to move through the
options, you will hear “narrow,” which is 0.5 inches all around, “moderate”
(left and right 0.75 inches, one inch top and bottom), and several others. When
you land on the one you want, press Enter or Spacebar. This will return you to
the document with the margins changed for the entire document if it only has a
single section, or just for the section you are in (see more on sections in
Chapter 8, section 8.3). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want to set your margins with dimensions other than
the pre-determined configurations mentioned above, you need to set custom
margins. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Margins submenu as above.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Shift Tab once to get to Custom Margins and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in an edit spin box for the top margin. The current top margin
value is displayed. Press the Up or Down arrow to adjust by one-tenth inch
increments, or manually type in your new choice. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab, and type in your desired bottom margin.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab to Left and type in the value.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab to Right, type in the value, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With JAWS, press Insert F1 once again to hear your new margin
dimensions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned above, NVDA and Narrator do not have an Insert
F1 equivalent for quickly checking current margins. You instead have to
navigate to the Custom margins dialog and press Tab to move through and hear
the dimensions.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc1629871">3.2.5 Changing Default Font, Paragraph, and Margin
Settings</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To change font defaults:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Font dialog box, make changes as instructed in Chapter 3.2.2
above. Common default font settings might be Times New Roman, Arial, or
Calibri; Regular; 11 or 12 point; with black (automatic) for color. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab a number of times to the Set as default button. Press Enter or
Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Be careful here because audio feedback is deceptive. You land on an OK
button that appears to say that Pressing it will change the default. Do not
press Enter here.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Instead, press Tab twice to get to a radio button. Use the Up arrow to
get to the All documents based on the Normal template radio button, and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To test this, open a new document with Control N and press Insert F to

</span>Press the Escape key. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc1629873">3.3 Headers and Footers (Including Page Numbering)</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Headers are situated between the physical top edge of your
page and the top margin. If your top margin is set at one inch, your header
text will be at one half inch from the top of the page. When you insert a
header, by default it will repeat at the top of every page of the document.
Headers may include page numbers, very short pieces of text, or small graphics
(like a company logo). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Footers are located between the bottom margin of the page
and the physical bottom edge of the page. Like headers, by default they will
repeat on every page. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Page numbers are inserted in either headers or footers. Word
has a useful shortcut key for adding page numbers to headers and footers when
you are in the Header or Footer panes. It is Alt Shift P held down together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JAWS also has a convenient way for you to check if you have
a header or footer in your document. Press Insert F1 for JAWS Screen-Sensitive
Help (we used this earlier for detecting margin dimensions). If there is a
header or footer, just before JAWS starts reading the margin dimensions, it
will say something like “header: 1” or “footer: 1,” which indicates the
existence of a header or footer with page numbering. This book has page
numbering in the header. If you are reading the electronic version with JAWS, press
Insert F1 now, and you will hear this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If there is also text in the header or footer, JAWS will
read that too. An example of what you would hear if the header has both text
and page numbering is: “Header: Freudian Analysis 1.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NVDA and Narrator do not have such a tool. You will need to
open the Edit control of the Header or Footer submenu and use the Right and
Left arrows to detect if there is anything there. Shortcut keys for Header Edit
and Footer Edit are Alt N H E, and Alt N O E, respectively.</p>

<h3>3.3.1 Header and Footer Insertion</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for creating headers and footers parallel each other.
The shortcut for opening the Header submenu is Alt N H. For footers, it is Alt
N O. To navigate to these dialog boxes via the ribbons:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, and press the Right arrow once to
get to the Insert tab if starting from the Home tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Right arrow to get to the Header and Footer group. You
land first on the Header submenu. Press Tab one more time to find the Footer
submenu. I will present the remaining steps just with headers because the steps
are identical for both. In addition, headers are used more frequently than
footers in Word. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Header submenu, press Enter to open it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You first land on the Blank button. Press Enter on this. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This lands you flush left in the Header pane. Type in text here if you
want left-aligned text in your header. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab once and your cursor moves to the center. Your screen reader
will usually say 4.25 quote, indicating you are at the exact center of a page
that is 8.5 inches wide. Type in text here to insert center-aligned text.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab one more time and your cursor moves to the right side of the
Header pane. Type in text here for right-aligned text. Often this will be a
page number. If so, use Alt Shift P to insert the page number. If you left and
Right arrow, you should hear the page number.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Exit the Header pane by pressing Escape and use the Down arrow to return
to the main body of your document. </p>

<h3>3.3.2 Different Headers or Footers on the First Page</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Often, you may not wish to have headers or footers on the
first page of your document, or you may want different header/footer text on
page one than on subsequent pages. In both cases, you will need to know how to
have a different header or footer on page 1. Steps for headers are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After opening the Header submenu, press Shift Tab three times to get to
the Edit control and press Enter (or use the shortcut: Alt N H E to get into
this edit field).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the ribbons. This lands you on a Header and footer tab
if you are using Word 365 (or a Design tab in other versions of Word). </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Right arrow several times to move to the Options group,
and press the Spacebar to check the for Different first page checkbox.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor on the first page of your document, open the Header
pane (shortcut key: Alt N H).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you want to leave the header blank, press Escape and Down arrow to
return to the main body of the document. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If instead, you want to insert text for your page one header, follow the
steps above for doing this. Then press Escape and Down arrow to return to the
main text of your document.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now navigate to page two of your document. Insert a header, which will
appear on all pages other than the first page. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat the steps for creating a header, inserting whatever text and page
numbering you want to appear on page two and beyond.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Escape and Down arrow to return to the main text.</p>

<h3>3.3.3 Removing and Editing Headers and Footers</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>In theory, you can edit a header or footer by going to the
Edit control in the Header or Footer submenu. But in practice, this sometimes
works poorly with screen reader programs. It is much easier to entirely remove
the header or footer and redo it. Here again, we’ll just talk about headers
because the process is the same for footers.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Header submenu as above (shortcut: Alt N H, or Alt N O if doing
this for footers).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Shift Tab twice to get to the Remove button and press Enter or
Spacebar. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now redo your header or footer if you want to replace it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shortcuts for removing headers and footers are Alt N H R and
Alt N O R, respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Be sure that your headers and footers have the same font
formatting as the main body of your document. Using headers as an example, the
easiest way to do this is as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Get into the Header pane (shortcut: Alt N H E).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control A to select all text in the Header pane.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control D to get into the Font dialog box, make your changes, and
press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Escape to move out of the Header pane, navigate to another page,
and press Alt N H E again to get into that page’s Header pane.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert F to verify that font formatting has changed correctly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that if you have different headers or footers for the
first page, you will have to repeat Steps 1 through 3 above for that page. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc1629874">3.4 Bulleting and Numbering Lists</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Often in Word documents, you will want to create lists of
items to set them apart from standard text. Bulleting is used if the order or
sequencing of the items in the list are not important. Numbering is used if the
order matters. A good example is a food recipe. You use bulleting to list the
ingredients because their sequence does not matter. You use numbering to list
the directions for preparing the recipe because the order matters. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk524695073">We’ll start with bulleting,
navigating to the dialog box via the ribbons. Steps are:</a></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the text you want to bullet. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Right arrow three times to get to the Paragraph group in
the Lower ribbon. You land on the Bullets split button. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter or Spacebar here if you want to bullet the text with the
default bullet format, which is a black round dot about half the size of the
adjacent text. This will return you to the document and your selection will be
bulleted. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If instead, you want to check out other bulleting options, press Alt
Down arrow to expand the split button options which appear in a grid.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Use the four arrow keys to move through the various choices, and press
Enter or Spacebar on the one you want. Other options include hollow dots, check
marks, and a few more. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you use the shortcut key instead (Alt H U, this opens the
Bullets split button and you can use the four arrow keys to move through the
options. Press Enter or Spacebar on your choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want to add an additional bullet in the middle of
your list, navigate to the end of the line above and press Enter. A new line
with a bullet will appear. If you are at the bottom of the list and you want to
add another item, with your cursor situated at the end of the line, press Enter
once and a new bullet will appear. If you press Enter a second time, bulleting
will end and text will revert to normal formatting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk524695743"></a><a name="OLE_LINK5">If you want
to remove bulleting, there are two ways to do this. First, select the bulleted
text. If you navigate to the Bullets split button in the Lower ribbon, if using

earlier versions, you only hear that it is checked). Press Enter or Spacebar to
uncheck Bullets. This will remove them. </a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, you can press the shortcut key (Alt H U), and arrow
to the None button. Press Enter or Spacebar and that too will remove bulleting.

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for numbering parallel those for bulleting. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2><a name="_Toc1629875">3.5 Headings and Styles</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Styles are powerful tools for ensuring consistent document
formatting, as well as for aiding navigation. Headings are used to organize and
format text. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Headings distinguish different types of content and help
readers find information. You can define headings at different levels (level 1,
level 2, etc.) to clearly establish a hierarchical structure of a document.
Lower level headings are subordinated to, or nested under, higher levels. Think
of a book where all the level one headings are parts of the book, level two
headings are chapters within the parts, and level three headings are sections
within the chapters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A style is the full set of font and paragraph format choices
that come together to make up the appearance of headings or normal text. Normal
text is text that forms the main body of a document. There are other style
types (for tables, footnotes, title pages, and others), but I limit discussion
here to headings and normal text.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The value of using styles is especially significant if you
are preparing a large document. Imagine that you are writing a 15-page term
paper or a 75-page consultancy report. You begin by outlining it at several
levels. You want to format titles for your sections. You navigate through the
text to find the section titles, formatting them one by one. You try to keep
straight in your head which one is at which level. Depending on how many titles
you need to format and how talented a typist you are, the whole process might
take anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple of hours. Unfortunately, you will
probably make a few mistakes along the way. Chances are good too that you will
later decide to adjust the formatting and you have to repeat the whole tedious
exercise again. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using headings and styles makes this process quick and easy,
both to do once, and to change later. Automating it minimizes formatting errors
and inconsistencies. This is true for sighted writers, and doubly so for
visually impaired writers. After all, the sighted writer can eyeball documents
to detect formatting errors. The visually impaired writer can’t do this, making
use of headings and styles even more advantageous. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use headings and styles to format any document that lends
itself to an outline structure, not just lengthy documents. They can also be
used for a short essay or a two-page resume. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We’ll first discuss how to navigate a document with
headings. Then we’ll see how to insert headings into a document. After that, we
will cover the power of styles as a formatting tool. </p>

<h3>3.5.1 Navigating Headings With Your Screen Reader</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS, there are two ways to navigate headings in Word
documents. First, you can press Insert F6, which gives a list of headings. Use
the Up or Down arrow to move through the headings, or first-letter navigate to
the heading you want. Press Enter and it will place you in the document on that
heading. You can also press Home and End to get to the first and last heading
in the list, respectively. This also works with Narrator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, and only with JAWS, you can press Insert Z, which
takes you out of Edit mode and places you in a virtual mode. JAWS will say
“Quick keys on.” You can then press H to go to the next heading, and Shift H to
go to the previous heading. You can also press 1 on the number row to go to the
next level one heading, 2 to go to the next level two heading, and so on.
Insert Z is a toggle, so press it again to return to Edit mode. JAWS will say
“Quick keys off.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With NVDA, there are also two ways to navigate headings. For
both, you must first switch to Browse mode, which is equivalent to the JAWS
Quick keys mode. To get a list of headings:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert and Spacebar together to switch to Browse mode. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert F7, which opens the Elements list. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Shift Tab once to get to a series of radio buttons for the types
of elements NVDA can navigate in Word documents. These include links, headings,
annotations, errors, and charts.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow to Headings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab once and you are now in the Headings Tree view. You can
navigate here by pressing the Up and Down arrows or first-letter navigating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, presenting the headings this way is confusing
because tree views are organized in levels different than those of headings.
For level one headings, NVDA will say “level zero” because it is identifying
its level in the tree view hierarchy rather than its level in the headings
hierarchy. Level one in the tree view hierarchy means it is a level two heading,
and so on. Consequently, I prefer using JAWS or Narrator to access headings
lists.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also navigate headings by activating Browse mode in
NVDA or Scan mode In Narrator with Insert and Spacebar, as above. Then you can
press H and Shift H to go to the next and previous heading, as well as navigate
by heading level with the keys 1, 2, 3, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Browse mode for NVDA and Scan mode for Narrator are toggles.
NVDA makes a noise when you activate it and a different noise when you turn it off.
Narrator will say “Scan mode on” and “Scan mode off.”</p>

<h3>3.5.2 Adding Headings</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is quick and easy. To add a level one, two or three
heading, place your cursor anywhere on the line you want to make into a
heading, and press the following keystrokes:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control Alt 1: For heading 1.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control Alt 2: For heading 2.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control Alt 3: For heading 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If, for example, you want to change a heading 1 into a
heading 2, just place your cursor on the line with the heading 1 formatting,
and press Control Alt 2to turn it into a level two heading. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To remove heading formatting, place your cursor on the
heading you want to remove, and press Control Shift N. This removes the heading
and changes it into normal text. </p>

<h3>3.5.3 What Is a Style?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A style is the sum of all font and paragraph formatting for
a particular piece of text. You can create styles for many different items in
your document, but the most important are heading levels and the main body of
your text, which is called the Normal style. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Heading styles help to visually set text apart from the rest
of the document. Heading 1 text may be bolded, have a large point size, be a
color other than black, and be centered. Before paragraph spacing may be as
much as 24 point, serving to visually separate it from the text that precedes
it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How you decide to format a given heading should not be
considered in isolation from the other heading level styles or the Normal text
style. Style format decisions need to be considered as an ensemble that creates
a visual hierarchy because lower level headings are subordinate to higher level
headings. In other words, a level one heading should visually be a “bigger
deal” than a level two heading. A level two heading should be a “bigger deal”
than a level three heading. And all headings should clearly stand apart from
the normal text.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An example of such a hierarchy could be:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Level one heading: Bold, Times New Roman, 16 point, <a
name="_Hlk86408774">black on white</a>, center aligned, 24 point Before
paragraph spacing, 0 point After paragraph spacing</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Level two heading: Bold, Times New Roman, 14 point, black on
white, left aligned, 10 point Before paragraph spacing, 0 point After paragraph
spacing</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Level three heading: Bold, Times New Roman, 13 point, black on
white, left aligned, 6 point Before paragraph spacing, 0 point After paragraph
spacing</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Normal text: Regular, Times New Roman, 12 point, black on white,
left aligned, 0 point Before paragraph spacing, 8 point After paragraph spacing</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the above example illustrates, heading level and normal
text styles are primarily set apart by point size, bolding, color, alignment,
and Before and After paragraph spacing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most important font and paragraph format settings were
discussed earlier in this chapter. But once again, they are listed below. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Font formatting considerations include: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Attributes: Bold, italics, underline, or Regular</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Point size</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Font color</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Paragraph formatting considerations include:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alignment (left, center, justify, right)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Left and right indentation </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>First line indentation for Normal text only </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Before paragraph spacing (may be variable with larger point sizes
for level one heading, descending downwards for levels 2 and 3, 4, etc., always
0 point for Normal text)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>After paragraph spacing: 0 point for headings, variable for
Normal text (see the Paragraph dialog box section above for special
considerations related to Normal text)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Line spacing (single spacing for headings, usually single or
double for normal text).</p>

<h3>3.5.4 Changing Styles for a Single Document</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This process is the same for all heading levels, as well as
for Normal text. We will use the level two heading style as an example. Steps
are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to a current level two heading in your document and select the
entire line or lines. To select a single line, I prefer pressing Home to get to
the beginning of the line an then Shift End to select it. This is safer than
pressing Shift Down arrow. This guarantees your cursor focus will remain fully
on the line with the level two heading rather than the line below it. If your
focus strays from the line with the heading, the remaining steps will not work.
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Font dialog box, either navigating there via the Applications
key or using the shortcut key (Control D), and make your changes. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor still on that level two heading, open the Paragraph
dialog box, either navigating there via the Applications key or using the
shortcut key (Alt H P G), and make your changes. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor still on the level two heading, open the Styles
submenu. The shortcut is Alt H L. If you navigate there via the ribbons, it is
in the Home tab. You can press Control Right arrow several times to get to the
Styles group. This is the first command in this group. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='page-break-after:avoid'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You land on the
Heading 2 button. Do not press Enter or Spacebar here. Instead, press the
Applications key. You land on “update heading 2 to match selection.” Press
Enter on this. This changes the formatting of all other level two headings in
your document to reflect the changes you made on the selected text.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To test this, navigate to any other level two heading in the document
and press Insert F to confirm that the font and paragraph formatting has
changed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you complete the above steps for Normal text, your
screen reader will say “Normal text button” when you land in the Styles
submenu. When you press the Applications key, you will land on “update Normal
to match selection.”</p>

<h3>3.5.5 Changing Default Styles for Future Documents</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may not care for the default styles that come with your
computer and wish to change them. However, you can only change defaults for new
documents, not for previously saved documents. To make style changes in
already-saved documents, follow the steps in the previous section. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To know what your current default styles are for a
particular heading level, or for Normal text, open a blank Word document. For
Normal text, press Insert F and your screen reader will reveal your default
font and paragraph formatting. For a heading level, type in a few words of text
and turn it into a level one, two or three heading by pressing Control Alt 1,
2, or 3, and use Insert F again to reveal the default font and paragraph
settings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using the level two heading example again, here’s how to
change your default style:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open a new blank document. This is critical. If you attempt this in a
document that has already been saved, nothing below will work. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in a couple of words of text and press Control Alt 2 to make it a level
two heading. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the text. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat Steps 2 through 6 from the previous section. This changes level
two heading formatting for the current document only. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Styles submenu again (shortcut: Alt H L). This lands you on the
Heading 2 button. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key and then the Down arrow once to get to Modify
and press Enter. This opens the Heading 2 Properties dialog box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Shift Tab four times to get to the Only in this document radio
button. Press the Down or Up arrow once to the New documents based on this
template radio button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab twice to get to the OK button and press Enter or Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To test this, press Control N to open a new blank document. Type in a
couple of words, press Control Alt 2 to make it a level two heading, and press
Insert F to verify that the default changes have registered. </p>

<h3>3.5.6 Defining Shortcut Keys for Lower Level Headings</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Word has predefined shortcut keys for level 1, 2, and 3
headings only. You can add shortcut keys for up to nine heading levels. That
said, think hard before adding too many more levels because this will make your
document more challenging to read and write. You should rarely go beyond four
heading levels. To define a level four heading shortcut key, make sure you are
already in a document with three levels of headings. Otherwise, level 4 will
not appear in the Styles submenu. Steps are as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Position your cursor on a level three heading.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Styles submenu. Again, the shortcut key is Alt H L. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow once to the Heading 4 button. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow once to Modify, and press Enter.
This opens the Heading 4 Properties dialog box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Shift Tab three times to get to the Format button and press Enter
or Spacebar. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Up or Down arrow to get to the Shortcut key button and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This opens an edit box where you type in your shortcut key. Press
Control Alt 4 to make this your shortcut for level four headings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Close button and press Enter or Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab again to get to the OK button and press Enter or Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>To
test this out, type some text, press Control Alt 4, and confirm that it creates
a level four heading. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This remains your shortcut for level four headings as long
as this copy of Word is on your computer.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc530139638"></a><a name="_Toc1629876"></a><a name="_Toc40521048"></a><a
name="_Toc40521221"></a><a name="_Toc40521504">3.6 Tables</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use tables when you can present information more clearly and
succinctly than with text alone, keeping in mind that you should still
summarize main points in the body of your document. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the table you are creating contains numbers and
calculations, it is better to create the table in Excel first. This is because
it is more straightforward to do calculations in Excel and import the data into
Word. See Chapter 3.6.3 below on how to do this. If your table is primarily
text, creating it in Word is preferable because Word handles text editing
better than Excel. Generally speaking, limit your tables to no more than five
or six columns. Otherwise, you will have difficulty fitting the table on the
page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is my opinion that, generally speaking, JAWS provides a
significantly better experience than NVDA and Narrator when dealing with
tables. With JAWS, audio feedback is clearer and more consistent when
navigating within tables and more useful information about formatting is also
provided<a name="_Toc1629877">. </a></p>

<h3>3.6.1 Navigating Within and Between Tables</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are several ways to navigate within tables in Word.
First, you can use Control Alt and the four Arrow keys to move up and down
columns and across rows. Second, you can Press Tab and Shift Tab to move to the
next and previous cell. Note that this will also select the cell content. If
you want to replace text inside a cell, press Tab or Shift Tab to get into a
cell and type over the existing content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JAWS has an additional way to navigate within a table using
what is called a Layered mode. With your cursor inside the table, hold down
Insert and Spacebar together. You will hear a click. Press T and JAWS will say
“table layer.” Now you can use just the four Arrow keys to move up, down, left,
and right in the table. To exit this mode, either Press Escape (a chime will
sound) or Press Alt Tab to move away from the window. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some other useful keystrokes for moving inside a table are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control Alt Home: Move to first cell, or in other words, to the
top left cell.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control Alt End: Move to last cell, or in other words, to the
bottom right cell.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt Windows Period: With JAWS only, read current column.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt Windows Comma: With JAWS only, read current row.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS, with cursor focus in a table you can also press
Insert F1 for Screen-Sensitive Help. A great deal of useful information about
table formatting and keystrokes is provided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are several ways to navigate between tables in a Word
document. With JAWS, press Insert Z to turn on Quick keys mode. Then Press T
and Shift T to move to the next or previous table, respectively. When finished
navigating, press Insert Z again to turn off Quick keys mode and return to Edit
mode.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS you can also get a list of tables by pressing
Control Insert T. Press the Up or Down arrow to get to the table you want to
navigate to, and Press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With NVDA and Narrator, turn on Browse and Scan mode s,
respectively, with Insert and Spacebar. Then Press T and Shift T to move to the
next or previous table. When finished navigating, press Insert and Spacebar
again to return to Edit mode. NVDA and Narrator do not have any keystrokes for
listing tables. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc1629878">3.6.2 Creating Tables</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tables may have up to three parts: A title or caption at the
top; the body with rows and columns in the middle; and notes on sources at the
bottom. </p>

<h4>3.6.2.1 Table Body</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first step is to create the body of the table. To do
this, open the Insert tab, press Tab several times to get to the Tables
submenu, and Press Enter (shortcut: Alt N T).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This lands you in a grid where your screen reader says “1X1
table,” meaning one column by one row. Press the Right arrow to increase the
number of columns and the Down arrow to increase the number of rows. Press
Enter or Spacebar when you have the number of columns and rows that you want.
As mentioned above, the number of columns should not exceed five or six, given
the finite physical width of a page in Word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After you create the table, your cursor is placed inside the
top left cell of the table. Your screen reader program tells you the row number
and column number (example: “row 1 of 4, column 1 of 5”). Using the navigation
keys mentioned above, you can now move inside the table to add column titles
along the top row, row titles down the left column, and your data in the other
cells. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By default, tables inserted into a Word document have thin
gridlines around all the cells, thus setting the table apart from the rest of
the text. Border gridlines surround the entire table, and horizontal and
vertical gridlines surround all the individual cells. The default size and
color for all of these are 0.5 point black. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>How can you verify if you have gridlines when you cannot see
them? With JAWS, this is easy. With your cursor placed inside the table, press
Insert F1 for JAWS Screen-Sensitive Help (we used this earlier for checking
margin dimensions). JAWS will start saying lots of stuff. If there are
gridlines, you will hear them indicated just after you hear “table padding.” If
the defaults are in place, JAWS will say, “Cell border: Surrounding single line
with width of 0.5 points. Table border: Surrounding single line with width of
0.5 points.” If you hear no cell or table border information just after “table
padding,” this means that no gridlines are present. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may wish to change the gridline configuration. You can
select the entire table or an individual row and then change the gridline
configuration for that selection. Because there are so many variations on how
you can do this, I will start by removing all gridlines to make the process
easier to understand. Here are the steps: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor anywhere in the table. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon and use the Right arrow to get to the
Table Tools Design tab. Note that when you are in a table and open the Upper
ribbon, at the extreme right, two new Table Tools tabs appear—a Design tab and
a Layout tab. Do not confuse these with the Design and Layout tabs further to
the left on the Upper ribbon. Those concern formatting of the overall document.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Table Tools Layout tab, press Tab once to get to the Select
submenu (shortcut: Alt J L K) and Press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to get to Select Table, and Press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Upper ribbon again, and Press the Left arrow once to get to the
Table Tools Design tab along the Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon to the Borders and shading button (shortcut:
Alt J T O) and Press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This opens a Tables and borders dialog box where you first land on a
list of radio buttons. Press the Up or Down arrow to get to None and Press
Enter. This will remove whatever gridlines currently exist. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now place your cursor anywhere in the table if you want to change
gridlines for the entire table. Or place it somewhere in the row you want to
change if you want to alter gridlines for just that row.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Return to the Select submenu in the Table Tools Layout tab. Down arrow
to get to Table or Row, and Press Enter on the one you want to change. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Now
return to the Borders and Shading dialog box of the Table Tools Design tab. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>11.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Tab
to get to Top Border, and check it if you want gridlines to appear for this.
Note that you must Press Enter to check or uncheck the checkboxes in this
dialog box. Pressing the Spacebar will not work, which is inconsistent with how
checkboxes are supposed to work, but is just the way it is here.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>12.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Tab
to get to Bottom Border and check or uncheck it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>13.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Tab
to get to Left Border and check or uncheck it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>14.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Tab
to get to Right Border and check or uncheck it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>15.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Tab
to the OK button and Press Enter or Spacebar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Admittedly, this is complicated. If you think you have
messed up, the easiest thing is to select the table again, and in the Tables
and borders dialog box, press Enter on the None radio button to clear any
existing gridlines and start over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can add additional rows or columns, or delete them. This
is most easily done using the context menu reached via the Applications key.
With your cursor located on the row or column where you wish to insert
additional rows or columns, press the Applications key, Down arrow to the
Insert submenu, and Press Enter. Your choices here are: insert columns to the
left, insert columns to the right, insert rows above, and insert rows below.
Press Enter on your choice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To add more rows at the bottom of the table, navigate to the
last table cell at the bottom right. JAWS will say, “Last cell in table.
Warning: pressing Tab here adds an extra row.” NVDA and Narrator do not say
anything, but pressing Tab here has the same effect. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Delete option in the context menu lists four radio
buttons: shift cells left, shift cells up, delete entire row, and delete entire
column. Press Enter on your choice. </p>

<h4>3.6.2.2 Title or Caption</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>You should add a title above your table. While it is
possible to simply type the text above the table, it is better to use the
Captions command in the References tab of the ribbons. This will facilitate
consistent formatting and numbering, as well as make the whole process of
constructing tables less burdensome. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To add a caption to a table, first make sure that your
cursor is located somewhere in the body of the table. Then:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the References tab along the Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Right arrow to jump by group to the Captions group. The
first command here is the Insert Captions button. Press Enter on this, which
opens a dialog box. The shortcut for this is Alt S P.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in your table title. By default, the labels Table 1, Table 2, etc.,
will be added to your title.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Labels combo box, where your choices are Table or Figure
(this dialog box is also used for inserting captions on figures and diagrams).
The default is Table.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Position, where your options are Above Selected Item or Below
Selected Item. The default is the above position. Do not change this.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Exclude Label from Caption checkbox, which is unchecked by
default. Check this if you do not want the default labels Table 1, Table 2,
etc., to appear. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Numbering. Here you can change the numbering style (Roman
numerals, add chapter numbers, etc.) of the default labels, if you choose to
keep them. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When finished, Tab to the OK button and Press Enter or Spacebar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By default, the table number, with a colon after it, and the
table title are placed on the same line in regular text. If you need to alter
this, after first creating the caption, press the Up or Down arrow to get back
into it, and make whatever changes you need using the Font or Paragraph dialog
boxes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have several tables in your document and insert a new
one in the middle or reorder them, table numbering in the captions will not
automatically adjust. To refresh, select the entire document with Control A and
Press F9.</p>

<h4>3.6.2.3 Notes on Sources</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The last part of a table is notes on sources, as well as
whatever other explanatory notes you may wish to add. Similar to captions, you
might decide to “cheat” by simply typing source notes just below the table.
However, there is a better way to do this that keeps the notes as part of the
table, making it easier to maintain consistent formatting. This involves
inserting an additional row at the bottom of the table, merging the cells in
that row, and typing in your notes there. You then customize the gridlines to
hide them, following steps in Chapter 3.6.2.1 above. On a printed page, the
gridlines do not appear to be part of the table, but they actually are.
Electronically they appear fainter than the other “non-hidden” gridlines. Steps
to add this new row at the bottom of the table with accompanying notes are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the bottom right of your table, press Tab once to add an additional
row. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon and use the Right arrow to get to the
Table Tools Layout tab. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab once to get to the Select submenu and Press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor still in the row you just inserted, Down arrow to get
to Select Row and Press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, use the Down arrow to get to Merge cells,
and Press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>Let’s say your table has four
columns. Now if you Press the Up arrow once and the Down arrow once to get back
into the merged row, JAWS will say “number of columns changed from four to
one.” Narrator says “Merged cell, spans four columns.” Unfortunately, NVDA does
not clearly indicate the presence of merged cells.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can now Type in your notes in this merged cell, allowing
text to wrap around to additional lines within the row, or pressing Enter to
add more notes in the same cell. In both cases, the row height will adjust
automatically to accommodate your text. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You are now ready to hide the left, right, and bottom
gridlines for this row, but not the top gridline because this will remain the
bottom-most visible gridline in your table. To do this: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor still situated in the merged cell, press Alt to open
the Upper ribbon. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Once again select the row by navigating to the Table Tools Layout tab,
pressing Tab to get to the Select submenu, pressing Enter, using the Down arrow
to get to Select Row, and pressing Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Upper ribbon again, and Press the Left arrow once to get to the
Table Tools Design tab along the Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon to the Borders and shading button and Press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Use the Down arrow to get to Custom.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Top Border and press Enter to check it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Bottom Border and Press Enter to uncheck it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Left Border and Press Enter to uncheck it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Right Border and Press Enter to uncheck it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Tab
to the OK button and Press Enter or Spacebar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The left, right, and bottom gridlines should now be hidden.
The top border remains visible, thus making it appear to be the bottom border
of the table. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may ask whether using captions and hiding gridlines is
worth all the effort. If you are inserting just one or two tables in your
document, perhaps not. However, if you anticipate having quite a few tables, in
the end, this will save you work, as well as help you to avoid formatting
mistakes and inconsistencies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Word tables can be quite complicated to format correctly.
You can create styles and do additional things to make them look professional.
My earlier book on formatting Word documents covers some of these. I would
advise you to have a sighted colleague check your work to check for mistakes. </p>

<h3>3.6.3 Importing Data from Excel to Create a Word Table</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Assuming you are already familiar with Excel (see Chapter
5), this is fairly easy to do, provided that the width of the columns you
import from Excel fit within the left and right margins of your Word document.
As mentioned above, do not import more than five or six columns from Excel.
Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Excel, select the data range of the table. Limit this strictly to the
columns and rows containing the column and row headers and data in the body of
the table. Do not select any title you may have created for it (usually in cell
A1) because this text is best entered later as a caption. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy the selected data range. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open a Word document and press Control V to paste the data if you want
the table to appear without gridlines that will go to a printer. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you want to include printable gridlines, do not press Control V.
Instead, press the Applications key, Down arrow to Paste options, Right arrow
to Use destination styles, and press Enter. Note that font styles will be
consistent with those of the Word document. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now do whatever additional table formatting (adding
captions, source notes, etc.) you wish, using techniques covered earlier in
this section. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc530139637"></a><a name="_Toc1629896">3.7 A Few Special Topics</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>People occasionally ask me how to generate tables of
contents and multi-column documents. These topics are discussed here. But
before that, I should talk about sections: what are they, and when do they
matter.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc1629895">3.7.1 Sections</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Section breaks are most frequently inserted when you wish to
change some aspect of page formatting inside your document. Section breaks are
more common in longer documents than in shorter ones. Situations where you
would insert section breaks include:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When repaginating inside a document (see the example of tables of
contents in Chapter 3.7.2 below). </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When changing page number formatting. One example could be if you
have created an executive summary which uses small Roman numeral formatting (i,
ii, iii, etc.) and Arabic numbering (1, 2, 3, etc.) for the main body of the
text. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When changing header or footer text within the document. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When temporarily changing from Portrait to Landscape orientation.
You might need to do this if you are inserting a table that is too wide to fit
on the page with Portrait orientation. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When inserting columns in the text (see Chapter 3.7.3 below). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are several types of section breaks. We will use Next
Page section breaks for outlining how to insert a new section in a document:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor at the top of the page where the main body of your
text begins.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Upper ribbon and Right or Left arrow to the Layout tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon to the Break submenu (shortcut: Alt P B) and
Press Enter to open it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Next page button and Press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now if you Up Arrow once and Down arrow once, both JAWS and
NVDA will say the page number and indicate that you are in section 2. </p>

<h3>3.7.2 Adding a Table of Contents</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A table of contents is a useful tool for navigating a
document, as well as for giving readers a quick overview of document content.
They can be quickly generated once you have inserted headings into your
document. See Chapter 3.5.2 on how to insert headings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are creating a table of contents for a newsletter
that will be sent to readers by email, page numbering will not be an issue, and
it can be placed just beneath whatever introductory text you generate. It is
not possible to generate a table of contents in Outlook. Create your document
and accompanying table of contents in Word and copy and paste the final version
into the body of an email. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the table of contents is intended for a report or book,
it should begin on a separate page after your title page and before the text of
your manuscript. Follow steps three through five below to generate it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To properly situate the table of contents for a manuscript
and then generate it:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the bottom of your title page, press Control Enter twice to create a
page break after the title page and another one just before the beginning of
your text. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor on the space between these two page breaks. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the upper ribbon and Right or Left arrow to the References tab. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once into the Lower ribbon to the Table of contents submenu
(shortcut: Alt S T). Press Enter to open the submenu.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter a second time on the Automatic table one button. A table of
contents is now generated with all headings up to level three and corresponding
page numbers listed. At the top, the title “Contents” is also inserted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can easily update a table of contents. Do this for any
of the following reasons:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You add or remove text that will change the page numbers. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You add or remove headings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You change the text in any of the existing headings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You change the format of the table of contents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To update the table of contents, your cursor can be anywhere
in the document. Hitting Tab twice past the Table of contents submenu in the
References tab gets you to the Update Table button (shortcut: Alt S U). When
you get into this dialog box, you land on a set of radio buttons with two
choices: Update Page Numbers Only, or Update Entire Table. Up or Down arrow to
the one you want, and press Enter</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few adjustments are now needed. Generally, it is a good
idea to limit your table of contents to just level 1 and 2 headings. Level 3
headings can be included if they are not too numerous. Three levels is the
default. Level 4, 5, and 6 headings should not appear. I have limited this
book’s Table of contents to just the first level because including lower level
headings would make it spill onto several pages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To limit the heading levels:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Table of contents submenu.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Custom table of contents dialog and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Show levels edit combo box, and Up or Down arrow to the last
heading level you want to appear. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you have already created a table of contents, you will be asked if
you want to replace the existing table. Press Enter or Spacebar to confirm. If
you have not yet created it, do so now, using the steps outlined above. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In your document, navigate to the Table of contents and Verify that only
the correct heading levels are shown. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to the Show levels edit combo box, there are two
checkboxes worth mentioning in the Custom table of contents dialog:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Show page numbers checkbox: This is turned on by default. Uncheck
it if your table of contents is intended for an electronic newsletter to be
contained in the body of an email message. It will not include page numbers. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Use hyperlinks instead of page numbers checkbox: This is checked
on by default, and you should always keep it checked. Note that the wording is
a bit deceptive. If you keep the Show page numbering checkbox checked, page
numbering will still be displayed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An additional adjustment needs to be made for manuscripts.
Because your table of contents follows the title page, and the table of
contents also takes up at least one page, your manuscript text will begin on
page 3 or 4. This will be reflected in the pagination of the table of contents.
You will need to repaginate the document so that the main text starts on page
1. Consequently, you must insert a section break and then repaginate beginning
from this point. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, first insert a Next Page section break as outlined
above. Now, with your cursor still at the top of this new section, there are
two ways to repaginate. If you are only concerned with having page numbers
appear in your header or footer for the main text and not on the title page or
table of contents itself, do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the upper ribbon and navigate to the Insert tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Hit Control and use the Right arrow to the Header and Footer group.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Page Number submenu and press Enter (shortcut: Alt N N U). </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Page Number Formats and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Continue from Previous Section check box and hit the Spacebar
to uncheck it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Start At edit spin box and hit the Up Arrow to 1.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now Up arrow once and Down arrow once, and your screen
reader will say, “page 1, section 2.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, update the table of contents, and it should be
correctly paginated. </p>

<h2>3.7.3 Multi-Column Formatting </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may wish to use multi-column formatting to prepare a
newsletter or flyer. You can use it for an entire document or a section of a
document. Because text navigation and editing can be a bit complicated in a
multi-column environment, it is better to convert your text towards the end of
the document preparation process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for converting standard text to multiple columns are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the text that you wish to convert. Assuming this is a fairly
large amount of text, use the Extended text selection process (see Chapter
3.8.6 below) to select the text. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the Layout tab of the Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Columns submenu (shortcut: Alt P J) and press enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To accept default formatting, Down arrow to the number of columns you
want and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The default formatting includes automatically calculated
column width, and blank space between columns. For example, if you select two
columns on a standard 8.5 by 11-inch page with one-inch left and right margins,
each column will be three inches wide with one-half inch blank space between
columns, totaling 8.5 inches. If you wish to alter any of these parameters,
repeat steps one through three above, and then:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to More, and press Enter. This opens a dialog box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up arrow to the number of columns you want. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Line Between and press the Spacebar if you want a narrow line to
appear between the columns.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Width and change it if you want.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Spacing (this is the space between columns) and change it if you
want. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Checkbox which is checked by default. If you uncheck this,
you will need to press Shift Tab to go back an manually adjust the various
column widths. Probably, you will rarely uncheck this checkbox.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Apply To, where your choices are Entire Document, Selected Text,
or Section, depending on how you have highlighted the text. Up or Down arrow to
the appropriate selection.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few other important points to highlight. First, if you
select text (rather than the entire document) and insert columns, section
breaks will automatically be inserted at the beginning and end of the
multi-column text. If you want the multi-column text passage to appear on
separate pages than the text before and after it, press Control Enter where the
new sections begin and end to insert page breaks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the multi-column text, you can insert a column break
if you want to start a new column before it would naturally wrap back to the
top of the next column to the right. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Layout tab of the ribbons, Tab to the Breaks submenu and press
Enter. The shortcut key is Alt P B.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Column button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JAWS has a few keystrokes that are helpful when formatting
columns. With your cursor in one of the columns, press Insert F1 for JAWS
Screen-Sensitive Help. JAWS will say something like: ”The cursor is in text
column 1. The section contains 2 newspaper style columns which are 3 Inches
wide. The columns are evenly spaced. The gap between columns is 0.5 Inches
wide. There is a vertical line between the columns. The document has 3
sections. The cursor is in section 2.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, be sure that breaks are set to be revealed in JAWS
Quick Settings. This is a default setting, but it is good to verify. To do
this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in Word, press Insert V to access Word Quick Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the edit box where you land, type in “break.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow once to the Page, section, and multiple column breaks
checkbox and check it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JAWS will now detect page, section, and column breaks while
reading through the document. This is particularly helpful in revealing when a
new column starts, and verifying that section breaks are correctly inserted at
the beginning and end of multi-column text passages.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NVDA reveals this information by default as you Up and Down
arrow through the document. When it encounters the beginning of a multi-column
text section, it will say something like “Section two, one of two columns.” At
the end of the multi-column section, it will say “Section 3, one of one
columns,” indicating a return to standard text. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Narrator does not announce any information when you enter or
exit multi-column text passages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also quickly navigate to section breaks by using the
Windows special character. Press Control F to open the Find command, type in
the special character which is “^B” minus the quotes, and press Enter. Press
the Spacebar to proceed to the next section break. The keystroke for the caret
symbol is Shift 6 on the number row. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, none of the screen readers have keystrokes
for toggling between columns. Just use standard navigation and reading keys for
moving by paragraph and Say all mode. Note that if you Down arrow to read line
by line, when you reach the bottom of a column, Down arrowing again will not
move you to the top of the next column. It will instead move you to the first
line of the next section in standard text. Only paragraph and Say all
navigation will move you to the top of the next column. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, you may wish to put a border around your columns.
This is especially appropriate if you choose to put a line between columns. It
would look strange to have only a line between the columns but not around them.
To add borders:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor situated in the section with the multi-column text, go
to the Design tab of the Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon to Page borders and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Box radio button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab through and you should hear that the top, bottom, left, and right
borders are checked.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Apply to and Down arrow to “This section.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also select various customizations in this dialog
box, such as changing the line format, width and color.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc1629865">3.8 Additional Tools for Text Reading, Selection, and
Editing</a> </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may already be familiar with the above keystrokes.
However, you might be less familiar with some of the tricks and tips in this
section, so read on. </p>

<h3>3.8.1 The Find and Find and replace Commands</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Find command is useful for searching for specific pieces
of text. Press Control F and type in the word or words you want to search for.
Press Enter and Word will jump to the first occurrence of the word from your
cursor position. Press Escape to return to the text if this is the occurrence
of the word you were looking for. If not, press the Spacebar to jump to the
next occurrence, and each subsequent occurrence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Find and replace command is a great time-saver if you
have to replace numerous occurrences of a word, phrase, or code with something
else, or you need to delete it. The shortcut key is Control H. A few examples
help to illustrate its utility. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The screen reader program “JAWS” should be written in all
caps. But if you have mistakenly written it with only the first letter
capitalized, and you have repeated this many times in your document, it will be
tedious to find every occurrence and manually correct it. Instead, do the
following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control H, which lands you in the Find edit field. Type in the
incorrect “Jaws” (minus the quotes).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Replace field and type in the correct “JAWS” in all
caps, minus the quotes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to the Replace all button, and press Enter or the
Spacebar. Your screen reader will say “All done. We made 46 replacements,” or
whatever the correct number is. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Your focus is on an OK button. Press the Spacebar to finish. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Escape key to exit the Find and replace dialog. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here’s another example, and one I use frequently. If you
copy and paste text from the Internet into Word, it often comes in with lots of
unwanted hard returns between lines. The symbol for the hard return is caret P.
Press Shift 6 on the number row to type the caret symbol. To remove the extra
hard returns, type in “caret P” twice in the Find field, type it in once in the
Replace field, Tab to Replace all, and press Enter or the Spacebar. This will
remove the unwanted hard returns while preserving those for separating
paragraphs. Repeat this until you are down to zero replacements. Press the
Escape key when finished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To entirely delete multiple occurrences of some text, type
the text in the Find field, leave the Replace field empty, and press the.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that after invoking either the Find or Find and replace
command, pressing Control Page up or Control Page down to go to the previous or
next page no longer works. You will instead hear “previous occurrence” or “next
occurrence.” To remedy this, press Control G to invoke the Go to page command.
Now type in a page number and press Enter and Escape. Control Page up and
Control Page down will once again work for navigating to the previous and next
page in your document. </p>

<h3>3.8.2 Skim Reading </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Often, it is not worth your time to read every word in a
document. You may want to get a quick general impression of a document before
reading it in-depth. You can save yourself a lot of time and be more efficient
if you learn how to skim read.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sighted readers often skim read by glancing in a few key
places on the page and moving on. But how can screen reader users accomplish
the same thing? The basic idea is to jump from paragraph to paragraph,
listening to just enough text to get a general sense of the content of the
document. There are several ways you can do this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here is one way. The keystroke to jump to the next paragraph
and read it is Control Down arrow. To skim read, hold down Control and don’t
let it up. Now Down arrow to hear the first few words of the next paragraph.
Once you have a quick sense of its content, use the Down arrow to move to the
next paragraph, listen a bit, and so on. Obviously, when you arrive at an
important paragraph, listen all the way through. Because Control Down arrow is
a Windows keystroke, it works with all three screen readers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS and Narrator, another way to achieve the same
result is to use a combination of Quick keys mode and Scan mode, respectively
and P (for paragraph). With JAWS, press Insert and Z together to turn on Quick
keys mode. Now press the letter P to jump to the next paragraph, read a bit,
press P again, read some more, and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With Narrator, press Insert and Spacebar together to turn on
Scan mode. Now press the letter P to jump to the next paragraph, read a bit,
press P again, read some more, and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NVDA does not support first letter paragraph navigation with
P, so only the Control Down arrow technique will work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JAWS also has a Skim reading tool. Pressing Control Shift
Insert Down arrow displays a dialog with options for indicating how skim
reading is performed, including reading the first line or first sentence of
every paragraph. The advantage of this tool is that you can start it up with a
single keystroke and listen continuously without having to press any other
keystrokes. The disadvantage is that you have to listen to entire lines or
sentences before moving to the next paragraph. If speed is your objective, using
this JAWS utility will probably be significantly slower than the other methods.
</p>

<h3>3.8.3 Go To Command</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are in a large document with many pages, the Go To
command will help you to quickly navigate to a given page. Press either Control
G or F5 to open it, type in the page number you want to navigate to, and press
Enter. Now press Escape to exit the dialog box and you should now be situated
on that page. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Go to command default is page, but you can also use the
Go To command to navigate to other elements in your document, including
bookmarks, which are discussed in the next section. </p>

<h3>3.8.4 Bookmarks</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Insert bookmarks in documents so you can quickly navigate to
important passages. You need to know how to create bookmarks, as well as how to
navigate to them once you have created them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To add a bookmark:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate in your document to the place where you want to insert the
bookmark. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the shortcut key Alt N K. The Bookmarks command is situated in the
Lower ribbon of the Insert tab, but is difficult to find. Alternatively, you
can press Control Shift F5.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This lands you in an edit field. Type in the name of your bookmark. The
name cannot have any spaces between words. Type in a single word, or if you
want it to have more than one word, place an underscore between the words
(example: world_news). You also cannot repeat the same name in your document:
each bookmark name must be unique. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab once to get to the Add button and press Enter or Spacebar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you have created bookmarks use the Go To command to
navigate to them. The steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control G or F5.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By default, the Go To command is set for Pages. To change this, press
Shift Tab once, and Down arrow to Bookmarks. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab once and you land in a combo box with your list of current
bookmarks.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Use the Down arrow or first-letter navigate to get to your bookmark
choice, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Escape to move out of the dialog box and you should land at your
bookmark location. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS, there is another way to navigate to bookmarks
which is quicker than the above method. Turn on Quick keys mode by pressing
Insert Z. Now press B and Shift B to go to the next or previous bookmark. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To delete bookmarks if you no longer want them:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt N K or Control Shift F5 to get into the Bookmarks dialog box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow to the bookmark you want to delete.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab twice to the Delete button and press Enter or Spacebar. </p>

<h3>3.8.5 Highlighting Text and Accessing It With JAWS</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>An alternative to bookmarking is highlighting. Many sighted
students use a colored marker (usually yellow) to highlight text that they want
to refer back to while studying. Unlike with bookmarks, you can highlight large
segments of text. And then use the JAWS Skim Reading tool to quickly navigate
to those passages, as well as create a summary document containing all or some
of the highlighted text. Unfortunately, NVDA and Narrator do not have similar
tools.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:yellow'>Highlighting text is easily
done in Word. First, select the text you want to highlight. Then navigate to
the Text highlight split button in the Font group of the Home tab. The default
is yellow. Press enter or Spacebar to accept the default, or Press Alt Down
arrow to expand the split button and pick another color. The ribbon shortcut
key is Alt H I.</span> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Highlighting changes the background color for the selected
text. From here on, I will assume you choose the yellow default background. If
you Press Insert F to check formatting, it should say “default on yellow”
rather than the usual “default on default.” Note that it may not say this
immediately, but after a few tries, JAWS will eventually indicate that the
background color has changed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:yellow'>Once you have highlighted
text, you can now use the JAWS Skim Reading tool to quickly access your
highlights.</span> Steps are as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert F2. This opens the JAWS Manager.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press S several times to get to the Skim Reading tool and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Use rule type: attribute and color rule.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Color or attribute rules: background color” combo box and
press Y to select yellow. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Speak unit combo box and choose between lines, sentences, or
paragraphs containing text. Which of these you choose depends on how you have
highlighted the text. If you have primarily highlighted individual lines or
sentences, choose one of those in the combo box. If you have tended to
highlight entire paragraphs, choose that one. Experiment a bit for best
results. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Start skim reading button and press Enter or Spacebar to have
the highlighted text read back to you.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Far more useful, tab one more time to the Create summary button and
press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This final step presents a pop-up entitled “Skim Reading
Results” with each of the highlighted text segments appearing as links. Press
Enter on any of these links to get back into the Word document at that point.
If you want to create a separate document with all the highlighted text:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Skim reading results pop-up, press Control A to select all the
text.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy it to the clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open a new Word document with Control N.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Paste the text only with Alt H V T. Don’t do a simple paste because this
will keep the link formatting which is no longer useful when saved in a new
document. Each former link will be numbered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After you have skim read highlighted text, JAWS will
remember this and create a rule so you don’t need to repeat all the steps above
to define your skim reading parameters again. From now on, when you open the
Skim Reading tool you will immediately land on a combo box entitled “Rules
history: star – yellow.” You can then shift tab back to the Create summary
button or the Start skim reading button to perform these actions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:yellow'>To delete these rules if you
no longer need them, return to the JAWS Skim Reading tool and Tab a number of
times to the Delete rule or Delete all rules buttons.</span> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='background:yellow'>To see how JAWS reads this
information, several blocks of text have been highlighted in this section
(including this paragraph). Try the various tools above to check it out.</span>
</p>

<h3>3.8.6 Extended Text Selection </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes you need to select a large block of text, perhaps
several pages, and repeatedly pressing keystrokes for selecting smaller segments
of text is inefficient. Both JAWS and NVDA have an Extended text selection
command that makes this process much quicker and easier than trying to select a
large number of lines or paragraphs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To perform Extended text selection with JAWS:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor situated at the beginning of the text you wish to
select, press Control Windows K, which is the keystroke for creating a
temporary placemarker. JAWS will say “marking place.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor at the end of the text you wish to select, and press
Insert Spacebar, and then M. Be sure to hold down the Insert and Spacebar
together until you hear a click. Then press M. Don’t try to hold down all three
keys together. JAWS will say “selecting between marked place and current
position.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The text is now selected, and you can copy it with Control C, cut it
with Control X, or delete it with the Delete key. If you copy or cut the
selected text, you can then navigate to where you want to paste it and press
Control V.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>With NVDA: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor situated at the beginning of your text selection, press
Insert F9. NVDA will say “start marked.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor at the end of your text selection, and press Insert
F10. NVDA will tell you how many characters have been selected. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You can now copy, cut, paste, or delete your selection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here’s another way that works with all three screen readers
because it is a Windows process. However, audio feedback may not be very good. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor at the beginning of your selection and press F8. JAWS
will say “extended selection mode on.” Narrator won’t say anything, but it is
on.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the end of the text you want to select.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Use standard keystrokes to copy, cut, or delete the text.</p>

<h3>3.8.7 Paste Text Only<a name="_Hlk532797468"></a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Often when you copy and paste text from one application to
another, simply pasting with Control V will import undesired formatting from
the original source. This is especially true when copying text from a website
into a Word document. You may very well import font styles, sizes, and colors
that are very strange. Using the Paste text only command can help avoid
problems like this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk62022834">Let’s say you are on a web page and
wish to copy text from there and paste it into a Word document. First, select
the text and copy it as you normally would by pressing Control C. Now press the
Applications key, Down arrow twice to Paste options, Left arrow once to Paste
text only, and press Enter. Alternatively, use the shortcut key, which is Alt H
V T. </a></p>

<h3>3.8.8 Word Count</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Instructors often impose a word count limit on assignments.
Newspapers specify word limits for article submissions. To obtain the word
count, go to the Review tab of the Upper ribbon, press Tab three times to get
into the Lower ribbon to Word count, and press Enter. This reveals the number
of pages in the document, the word count, and several other statistics. The
ribbon shortcut is Alt R W.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To get the word count for a segment of text rather than the
entire document, select the text and use the keystrokes above to get a word
count for just that text.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An alternate method is to press F6 twice from inside the
document to navigate to the Status bar. If you do not immediately hear the word
count, Down arrow once or twice to hear it. Then press F6 two more times to
return to the document text.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Outlook is the Office Suite program for reading and sending
email messages. You can also save contacts, schedule appointments and meetings,
and create custom folders for storing messages. While many alternative programs
exist (the Windows Mail app, webmail, email on your smartphone, among others),
I find that Outlook is easier to use, more efficient, and more consistent and
predictable than these alternatives. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After installing Microsoft Office, you will need to load
your existing email account or accounts into Outlook. Unfortunately, when I try
to do this for my students, I often fail. While this process may not be
completely inaccessible, it often flunks the usability test. A call to the
Microsoft Disability Desk is often the best choice for getting this job done.
Before you call, be sure you know both your email address and password. If you
have forgotten your password, the Disability Desk should be able to help you
create a new one. </p>

<h2>4.1 Message Basics</h2>

<h3>4.1.1 Reading and Deleting Messages</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you first open Outlook, focus goes to the top message
in the list of messages in your Inbox. By default, messages are arranged
chronologically, with the most recently received message at the top of the list
and the oldest one at the bottom. Down arrow or Up arrow to a row with
information for each message. This includes the name of the sender, the
subject, the date, and size of the message. If one or more files are attached
to the message, this too will be indicated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Press Enter to open a message. Focus will be placed at the
top of the body of the message. Use standard reading keystrokes to read and
navigate through the body of the message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To access other fields in the message, press Shift Tab. This
will enable you to access the Subject, Date, To, CC and Date fields. Ordering
is not consistent between the various versions of Outlook, or at least I have
not been able to detect any pattern. However, if there are attachments, it is
always the case that a single Shift Tab, starting from the top of the message
body, brings you to the list of attachments (more on attachments below). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why is information in some of these other fields useful?
Beyond just yourself, it is good to know who else has received the message,
whether in the To or CC field. If the message was sent just to you, or to you
and just a few others, chances are good that the sender is expecting you to
reply. But if you are just one in a large group of recipients, or it has been
copied to you, then you are usually being sent the message for purely
informational purposes, and probably no response is expected from you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When finished reading the message, press Escape once. This
will usually return you to the Inbox. I say “usually” because there are times
when pressing Escape tosses you out of Outlook and places focus in another
previously opened window. This often happens when you have been working with a
message with attached files. When this happens, pressing Alt Tab once usually
returns focus to the Inbox. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you now want to delete the message from the Inbox, simply
press the Delete key and it will be moved to your Deleted items or Trash
folder. You will not be asked for a confirmation. Be diligent in deleting
messages you no longer need. If thousands of messages accumulate in your Inbox,
your efficiency in finding the messages you actually need will suffer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, be cautious about getting on lots of commercial
mailing lists. In extreme cases, I have had students who received 40 or 50
messages per hour, most of which were total garbage. Their ability to find the
one or two messages that actually mattered was severely hampered. In such
cases, consider creating a new email account and no longer using this
problematic one. Alternatively, you could unsubscribe from unwanted bulk email
lists, but this is time-consuming. For some of these lists, senders purposely
make it difficult to find out how to unsubscribe. </p>

<h3>4.1.2 Preparing Messages</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You will usually initiate the process of preparing a new
message from your Inbox. However, you can also do this from another folder
containing lists of messages. These include your Sent items, Deleted items,
Drafts folders, and any custom folders you have previously created. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To prepare a new message:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control N which will place your cursor in the To field.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the email address of a recipient. If you want to address the
message to more than one recipient, place a semi-colon after each address to
separate them. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the CC field, and type in addresses for those to whom you want to
copy the message.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Subject field and type in text that reflects the content of
the message.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Message body field and compose your message. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press either Alt S or Control Enter to send the message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that the very first time you press Control Enter to
send a message, a dialog box will open asking if you want to use this keystroke
as a shortcut for sending messages. Tab to the Don’t show this message again
checkbox and press the Spacebar to check it. Then Tab to the Yes button and
press Enter. This dialog box will no longer pop up. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After the message is sent, focus is returned to the folder
where you began preparing the message. At any point in preparing the message,
you can press Shift Tab to navigate back to the various fields. I mentioned
above that, when tabbing and shift tabbing through a message you have received,
the order is inconsistent. However, when you are preparing a message, the Tab
order is consistent and predictable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here’s some advice on email etiquette. Take time to put text
in the Subject field that meaningfully reflects the content of your message.
For example, if you are on a technology discussion list, don’t type in vague
stuff like “A Question,” or “Problem with Outlook.” Be specific instead by
typing “Problem Creating Outlook Folders.” If you consistently type in vague
text on the Subject line, recipients will think you don’t know what you are
doing or are just lazy. And if you can’t take the time to type in something
thoughtful, why should recipients waste their time opening and reading your
messages?</p>

<h3>4.1.3 Replying To and Forwarding Messages</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two ways to reply to a message you have received –
replying to just the original sender or replying to the original sender and all
other recipients. To reply to just the sender:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the message and press Control R.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This lands you in the body of the message and the subject starts with
RE: to indicate that this message is a reply. Type in your message. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt S or Control Enter to send the message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To reply to the sender and all other recipients, press
Control Shift R and repeat steps 2 and 3 above. This is called Reply to all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now for some sage advice on using Reply to all. Before
sending, and especially if you think your message is sensitive or potentially
negative in some way, always Shift Tab to verify the addresses in the To and CC
fields. If you are a veteran emailer, you inevitably know of horror stories
where you either sent a message to an unintended recipient, or you received a
message that was clearly not meant for your ears or eyes. Just thinking about
this dredges up bad memories and nausea. In best case situations, such faux pas
were just mildly irritating. Unfortunately, I also know of situations where the
results were extremely ugly. So always doublecheck before sending. Even better,
if you ever think that a message could be remotely offensive, don’t send it.
Even if you are diligent in doublechecking your addressees, remember that those
same addressees might not be as careful as you, and could cause problems in the
next round of replies. If you really feel like you need to vent some pent-up
frustration to somebody, use old-fashioned technologies like the telephone
instead. Email is an effective communication tool for many things. Resolving
interpersonal conflicts is not one of them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After receiving a message, you may wish to forward it to
other people. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Arrow to the message in your message list or open the message.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control F which places focus in the To field.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in the email address or addresses of the intended recipients. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you want to add a message from yourself, Tab to the message body and
type it in.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt S or Control Enter to send the message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Subject field will begin with FW: to indicate it is a
forwarded message. </p>

<h3>4.1.4 BCC Field </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use the Blind carbon copy, or BCC field to hide addresses
among recipients. This is most frequently done for privacy and confidentiality
purposes. As you know, it is inappropriate to share other people’s phone
numbers without their permission. The same goes for email addresses. If you
have ever received a message that said, “From John Smith to John Smith,” this
is an indication that the sender used the BCC field to prepare it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The BCC field does not appear by default. You will need to
add it. To do this, you need to be in the window for preparing a message. Steps
for adding the BCC field are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control N to prepare a new message. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, and Right arrow to the Options tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the BCC button and press Enter. The shortcut key is Alt P B.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The BCC field now appears between the CC and Subject fields.
Any addresses you insert here will not be seen by the recipients. The BCC field
will now appear in all future messages. To remove it, repeat the steps above. </p>

<h3>4.1.5 Issues Related to Selecting Addresses</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are various ways you can enter email addresses in the
To, Cc and BCC fields. If you have no previous history of exchanging emails
with a particular recipient, you will need to type in the full address. If you
have some previous history of exchanging messages with a recipient, typing in
the first letter or first several letters of that person’s address may
auto-populate the address field with that person’s address. If you hear the
desired address as you are typing, either press Enter or the Tab key to input
that address. After doing this, it is a good idea to Tab to the next field, and
then Shift Tab back to verify that the correct address has been entered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s say that you have several addresses in memory that
begin with the letter M and you want to send a message to Mary Jones. If you
press M and hear the address of somebody else, press the Down arrow key to see
if Mary Jones is in the list. If she is, press Enter or Tab to insert that
address. If her address does not appear, press Alt K and this will usually
extend the list to more addresses beginning with the letter M. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Auto-populating of addresses, as well as getting a full list
of addresses, used to work reliably in Outlook. In the last few years, this
seems to have broken. Sometimes addresses for people you seldom communicate
with appear, while regular correspondents fail to appear in the list. Pressing
Alt K may extend the list, but with no guarantee of finding the desired
address. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To ensure that you don’t lose addresses, it is a good idea
to diligently add addresses to your Contacts folder. They are not automatically
added just because you have a history of exchanging messages with a person. See
Chapter 4.6 on how to add contacts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are several ways to access addresses in your Contacts
folder for preparing messages. The two ways I prefer involve first navigating
to the Contacts folder. The quickest way to get there is to press Control 3
from anywhere in Outlook. Once in the Contacts folder, you can use the
following technique if you have a Microsoft 365 account. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>First-letter navigate to the last name of the person whose address you
want to use. Note that you can only press that first letter once, and will then
need to Down arrow through other last names beginning with that letter until
you find the contact you want.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter to open the contact dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt H E to address a message to that person. You land in the
Subject field, with the address already inserted in the To field.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Complete the message and send it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If this does not work for you:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat steps 1 and 2 above.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Email edit field.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the email address and copy it with Control C.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Escape out of the Contact dialog and return to the Inbox.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control N to prepare a message.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control V to paste the address in the To field. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Complete the message and send it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have found that my iPhone more reliably remembers the full
list of recipients with whom I have a history of corresponding. If the above
steps don’t work, I search my native Mail app or Outlook app there and usually
find the address I am looking for. This works despite the fact that I do not
regularly enter email addresses into my iPhone contacts.</p>

<h2>4.2 File Attachments</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>People often have the impression that dealing with
attachments is complicated and confusing. This may especially be the case for
saving them and attaching them to a new message which can involve navigating to
the ribbons and opening a sometimes confusing dialog box. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While that is one approach, I am going to ignore that and
show you a simpler and quicker way that involves selecting, copying and pasting
files. In this section, I will cover opening attached files without saving
them, a short detour on disabling Protected view, saving attached files you
have received, and attaching files to a message you are preparing. I will also
talk about dealing with multiple attachments. </p>

<h3>4.2.1 Opening Attachments</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To open an attached file without saving it:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the email message with the attachment.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Home to place your cursor at the top left of the message
field. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab once to place focus on the attached file and press Enter (note
that pressing the Spacebar will not work).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You first land on a Save button. Tab twice to the Open button and press
Enter or Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The attached file now opens in a separate window and you can
read through it. When you are finished with it, press Alt F4 to close the
window. If this is the first time you are opening a Word, Excel, or PowerPoint
file, you will hear that the file is in Protected view. You will need to
disable this before you can read or edit the file.</p>

<h3>4.2.2 A Short Detour About Disabling Protected View</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Files from the Internet, email attachments, and from other
potentially unsafe locations can contain viruses and malware that can harm your
computer. Protected view is intended to help protect your computer. Ultimately,
your best defense is to only open or save attachments from people you trust.
Never open or save a file from somebody you don’t know. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For any Word, Excel or PowerPoint files you receive as
attachments, you will need to disable Protected view in each of those
applications so that attached files you attempt to open or save to your
computer behave properly. You can disable Protected view one file at a time, or
you can do it permanently. Procedures are identical in each of these Office
applications. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To disable Protected view one file at a time:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the email message with the attached file.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From the top of the body of the message, press Shift Tab once to place
focus on the attachment, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control S or F12, as if you were intending to save the attached
file. Your screen reader will say, “Saving is disabled in Protected view. If
you trust the source of this file, and would like to save, click enable
saving.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Enable saving button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To disable Protected view permanently, and using Word as an
example. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Word and press Alt F T to open the Options dialog which contains a
list of categories.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow or press the letter T to get to the Trust center category,
but do not press enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Trust center settings button and press enter or spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the letter P for Protected view, but do not press enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to each of the following three checkboxes and press the spacebar to
uncheck them: Enable Protected view for files originating from the Internet;
Enable Protected view for files located in potentially unsafe locations; and
Enable Protected view for Outlook attachments.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press enter or Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to a second OK button and press enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you started this procedure while in a file that you opened in
Protected view, press Alt F4 to exit the file and then reopen it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Protected view is now permanently disabled for this
application. Note that disabling Protected view exposes you to a greater degree
of vulnerability to viruses and malware. Your best defense against malicious
viruses is to never open or save an attachment from somebody you do not know.
Take no chances: delete the message instead. </p>

<h3>4.2.3 Saving Attachments</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The quickest and easiest way to save an attachment from a
message you have received is to use the copy and paste method. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the message with an attachment.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab once to land on the attached file. This selects it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy the file to the Clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to where you want to save it and press Control V to paste it
there.</p>

<h3>4.2.4 Attaching Files</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Attaching files from your Documents folder or some other
folder on your computer to a message you are preparing simply involves
reversing the save process in the previous section. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the folder on your computer where the file is located, Up or Down
arrow to, or first-letter navigate to the file you wish to attach. Either of
these selects the file.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy it to the Clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Outlook and prepare a message, following the steps enumerated in
Chapter 4.1.2 above, inserting one or more addresses in the To field.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor situated in the body of the message, press Control V to
attach the file. Note that you must be in the message body for this to work. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab once to verify that the attachment is there.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt S or Control Enter to send the message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Be sure to include text in the Subject field, body of the
message, or both, referencing the attachment so recipients are aware it is
there. Also note that you can attach multiple files. If they are all located in
the same folder, you can select and copy them using the same file selection
keystrokes outlined in Chapter 2.6.2. If the files are not all located in the
same folder, you will have to select them separately. </p>

<h3>4.2.5 Multiple Attachments</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may receive messages with multiple attachments or wish
to attach more than one file to a message. To access multiple attachments in a
message you have received, open the message and press Shift Tab once. Focus
will be placed on the first attached file. You will hear the file name and “one
of five attachments,” or whatever the total number of attachments is. Press the
Right arrow to move to the second attachment, and so on. Once you have placed
focus on an individual file, you can open it or save it using the steps
identified above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also save all the attachments to your computer. It
is advisable to create a new folder and save them there. If instead, you simply
save them to your Documents folder, they will scatter around in the
alphabetical list of files. You probably want to keep them together, at least
at first. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the message with multiple attachments.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab once to place focus on the first attachment.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control A to select all the files. Note that you may not hear
anything after you do this, or what you hear is inconsistent, but don’t worry.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy the files to the Clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the folder where you want to save them and press Control
Shift N to create a new subfolder. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in an appropriate folder name and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter again to place focus inside the new folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control V to paste the files in the new folder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want to attach multiple files to a message you are
preparing:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Follow the steps in Chapter 2.6.2 for selecting consecutive or
non-consecutive files.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy them. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the body of an email message, press Control V to paste the files.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Shift Tab once to verify that the files are there. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt S or Control Enter to send the message.</p>

<h2>4.3 Navigating Folders Using the Tree View</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>So far in this chapter, I have only talked about the Inbox
folder. But there are other important folders you will want to access,
including Sent items, Deleted items or Trash, Drafts, Calendar, Contacts,
Outbox, and custom folders that you create yourself. There are more folders,
but these are the most important. You navigate to these through a tree view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The tree view presents a hierarchical view of the folder
structure of your email account or accounts. The folder hierarchy is displayed
as levels 0, 1, 2, etc. as you arrow from left to right. Right arrow to open or
expand a folder, Left arrow to close or collapse a folder, and Up and Down
arrow to move within a folder level. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The precise nature of your folder structure varies according
to your account provider (Gmail, Comcast, etc.), as well as your account type -
IMAP or POP3 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>IMAP (Internet
Message Access Protocol) is a method of accessing email messages </span>that
downloads them to your computer, but also leaves copies on the server. If you
delete a message on your computer, this will be reflected on the server. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>Another popular email
protocol is called “POP3.” With POP3, messages are downloaded to the computer,
but any actions you take on the computer will not be reflected on the server.
The advantage of using an IMAP mail server is that users can check their mail
from multiple devices (computers and smartphones) and always see the same
messages. In essence, this synchronizes your messages on all your devices. POP3
does not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whichever provider and account type you have, the important
thing for you is to understand the logic of your tree view structure. Because
it is a very common arrangement, I will use the example of a Gmail IMAP
account. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Outlook Tree View can be accessed in two ways. You can
either press Control Y or Shift F6 to open it. We will now take a tour using
Control Y for a fictitious account called john.smith@gmail.com.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting from your Inbox, press Control Y, your screen reader will say
“Go to folder dialog tree view, the number of unread messages, inbox.” After
“inbox,” you may also hear “closed” if you have created some custom folders
(more on this later). </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up arrow once. You will hear level 0 john.smith@gmail.com open,
indicating that the account folders are still visible and expanded, but that
you have shifted left to level 0. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Left arrow one more time. You will hear john.smith@gmail.com closed,
indicating that the account folders are now collapsed. You are at level 0 and
as far left as you can get.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At level 0, if you Up arrow, you will hear “To-Do List.” If you Down
arrow, each account you have loaded into Outlook will be listed in the level 0
column.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Arrow back to john.smith@gmail.com closed.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow once and you will hear “level 1 john.smith@gmail.com open,”
indicating that you have shifted right to level 1. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow through the level 1 column for this email account. Folder
names you will hear are Gmail closed, Calendar, Contacts, Drafts, Outbox, and
numerous others. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up arrow back to Gmail closed.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow once and you will hear “Gmail open.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Down
arrow once and you will hear “Level 2 Drafts,” indicating that you have shifted
to the level 2 column where folders of Gmail are listed. Important folders here
are Drafts, Sent items, Trash, and Spam. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s stop our tour momentarily at this point. If you have a
Gmail IMAP account, it is critical that you know about opening or expanding
this level 2 area. Otherwise, you will not be able to access these important
folders. In addition, and this is a confusing thing about this folder
structure, you may have redundant Drafts and Deleted items folders at level 1
of the tree view. I do not know why these duplicate folders exist. They appear
to be there only to complicate your life. So, let’s say you save a draft
message and then go to this redundant level 1 Drafts folder where you will find
nothing. If you do not know that your draft message invariably goes to the
level 2 Drafts folder, you will think that it has disappeared, and you will
freak out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While this folder structure may seem unnecessarily
complicated, with some practice you will soon get used to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once your level 1 and 2 folders are expanded, you can use
first-letter navigation to move quickly, and then press Enter to get into that
folder. For example, starting from the Inbox, press Control Y and then S to
quickly navigate to Sent items. Press Enter to get into that folder. Press
Control Y again, and then C to navigate to the Calendar or Contacts folder, and
so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here are a few other useful keystrokes for moving around
quickly between folders:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt Left arrow: Move back to the previous folder you were in.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt Right arrow: Move forward one folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control 1: Move to the last folder you were in with a list of
messages. This could be the Inbox, Sent items, Deleted items/Trash or Drafts
folders. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control 2: Move to the Calendar folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control 3: Move to the Contacts folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control Shift I: Move to the Inbox.</p>

<h2>4.4 Custom Folders</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can create your own folders for organizing and easily
retrieving important messages. After creating a custom folder, you can easily
move or copy messages to it. This is preferable to leaving them in your inbox
where they will be harder to find as the number of messages grows. You can also
create rules for automatically moving messages to one of these custom folders.</p>

<h3>4.4.1 Creating and Managing Custom Folders</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Where you start the process of creating a custom folder
determines where it will show up in the tree view. If you start from inside
your Inbox, the custom folder will become a level 2 folder situated to the
right of your level 1 Inbox. If you open the tree view from your Inbox, you
will hear “Inbox closed,” indicating that you have one or more level 2 folders
currently collapsed to the right of your level 1 Inbox. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you start the process from inside level 0 where the name
of your account is, your custom folders will appear at level 1, the same level
where Inbox, Gmail closed, etc. appear. In the example below, we will start
from inside the Inbox.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From inside the List view of your Inbox messages, press Alt to open the
Upper ribbon and Right arrow to the Folder tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the New folder button and press Enter (shortcut key is
Control Shift E). </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in the custom folder name and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are several ways to copy or move messages from a
folder with lists of messages (Inbox, Sent items, Drafts, Deleted items/Trash)
to the custom folder. I will show just one way. Using the Inbox as an example,
here are the steps:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Inbox message list, arrow to a message to select it. To select
multiple continuous messages, arrow to the first message, hold down the Shift
key and arrow down to select additional messages.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy them or Control X to cut them. Most of the time,
you will want to cut them because one reason for having custom folders is to
clean out Inbox clutter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Y to open the tree view. You will either hear “Inbox
closed” or “Inbox open,” depending on whether the level 2 folders associated
with it are collapsed or expanded. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you hear, “Inbox closed,” Right arrow to expand it, and Down arrow or
first-letter navigate to the custom folder. If you hear, “Inbox open,” Down
arrow or first-letter navigate to it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter to get into the custom folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control V to paste the message or messages into the custom folder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can perform four actions on existing custom folders –
rename, copy, move, and delete. To do any of these, your focus must be inside
the folder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To rename a custom folder:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting from inside the folder you want to rename, press Alt to open
the Upper ribbon and Right arrow to the Folder tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times into the Lower ribbon to the Rename folder button and
press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in a new name for your folder and press Enter. The renamed folder
will now reposition itself alphabetically in the tree view within its level.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why would you want to copy or move a folder? The only reason
I can think that you might want to copy a folder is if you had more than one
account added to Outlook and you wanted to copy it to one of those other
accounts. You might want to move a folder if you would like it to be situated
at a different level in your folder structure. For example, you might decide
that you want to move a folder from level one to make it a level two subfolder
of your Inbox. I will only describe the steps for moving a folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting from inside the folder, press Alt to open the Upper ribbon and
Right arrow to the Folder tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times into the Lower ribbon to the Move folder button and
press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in a dialog box with the tree view. Arrow to, or first-letter
to the folder for which you would like to make this folder a subfolder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can delete a custom folder and all its contents if you
no longer need it. If you do not want to delete some of the messages contained
in this folder, copy or move them to another folder before deleting it. To
delete a custom folder:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting from inside the folder, press Alt to open the Upper ribbon and
Right arrow to the Folder tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times into the Lower ribbon to the Delete folder button and
press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span> You will be asked to confirm that you want to move the folder to the
Deleted items folder. Press the Spacebar on the Yes button to confirm. This
folder now becomes a subfolder of the Deleted items or Trash folder.</p>

<h3>4.4.2 Creating Rules for Moving Messages to Custom Folders</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can create rules for automatically moving messages to
designated folders. For example, if you are a member of a discussion list with
a fairly high daily volume of traffic, it can be quite useful to automatically
move messages from that list to a custom folder so you can read them later.
This will avoid cluttering up your Inbox.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can set several types of rules for moving messages. As
an example, I will set a rule for moving all messages from such a discussion
list to one of my custom folders. This is the most frequent use of rules in
Outlook. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In your Inbox, place focus on a message from the relevant sender.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to the Rules submenu and press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land on the Always move messages from [name of sender] button. Press
Enter on this.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This immediately places you in a tree view of your Outlook folders.
Navigate through the tree view to the custom folder where you want all messages
from this sender to be moved.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All previous and future messages from this sender will now
be automatically moved to this custom folder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are numerous other types of rules you can create. To
explore these, in the Rules submenu mentioned in step 2 above, Down arrow to
Create rule, and press Enter. This opens the Create rule dialog box where there
are a series of checkboxes for designating other types of rules, including
sound notifications for alerting you when a message has been moved as a result
of a rule. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you decide to delete an existing rule, do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting from one of the folders in the relevant account, open the Info
tab in the File Tab, Tab to Manage rules and alerts, and press Enter (the
shortcut key is Alt F I R).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to a list box which displays the existing rules, and
Down arrow to the rule you want to delete. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Delete key. You are asked to confirm that you want to delete
the rule. Press Enter or the Spacebar to confirm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that as you tab through, a Delete button appears before
the list box. You can use this button to delete a rule, but only if the rule
you are looking for is the most recently created one. If you have created more
than one rule, it is more straightforward to ignore this button and proceed to
the List box mentioned above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Be careful about creating rules for moving messages from a
sender who is important to you. If you do this, you will need to remember to
regularly visit this folder. I never do this because I don’t trust myself to
remember. But you might be different. You might think about creating a priority
or VIP custom folder and then define rules to automatically move messages from
a set of important senders to that folder.</p>

<h2>4.5 Sorting or Arranging Messages </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>By default, messages are arranged or sorted chronologically,
with the most recent messages received at the top of the list and the oldest
ones at the bottom. You can rearrange the messages in many different ways. I
often rearrange them by “from,” so they appear alphabetically with sender
addresses beginning with the letter A at the top of the list and those
beginning with Z at the bottom. I can then first-letter navigate, or quickly
press the first several letters of the name of the sender I want. If I want to
find a message from John Smith that I received about three weeks ago, it is
quicker to rearrange by sender rather than Down arrow a bunch of times to find
it. To rearrange messages in this way in your Inbox:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From within the Inbox, press the Alt key to go to the Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow to the View tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon several times to the Arrange by button and
press Enter or the Spacebar. You land on the Date button which is for arranging
messages chronologically. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow once to the From button and press Enter. You can also simply
press the F key. Messages are now arranged alphabetically from A to Z by
sender.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Home to verify that the A messages are on the top of the list and
the Z messages are at the bottom. If an email address starts with a number, it
will be above the A messages in the list. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This only rearranges messages in the folder you are
currently in, not other message list folders. When you are finished finding the
messages you were looking for, return the list to the default chronological
order by repeating steps one through three above, and pressing Enter on the
Date button, or pressing the D key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ribbon shortcut key combination for changing the sort
order to the From view is Alt V A B F (for view, arrange by, and from). To
change it back to the Date view. Press the sequence Alt V A B D. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Admittedly, this is a whole bunch of keystrokes. Because I
use this command several times a day, I have added this to the Quick Access
toolbar to speed things up. See how to add commands to the Quick Access toolbar
in Chapter 10.3.2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many other choices exist for sorting messages (by recipient,
subject, size, attachments, etc.). If I am in my Sent items folder, I will sort
by “To,” that is, who I sent messages to. Occasionally, I will sort by subject
if I want to isolate a message thread. I don’t find any of the other sort
options particularly useful.</p>

<h2>4.6 Creating Contacts</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can create contacts for individual email addressees as
well as for groups of people. In this section, I discuss two ways to do each of
these. </p>

<h3>4.6.1 Individual Contacts</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>I used to be pretty sloppy about maintaining email addresses
in my Contacts folder. When I typed in the first few letters of an address in
the To field, the entire address reliably appeared so that I did not need to
type in the full address. I would then either press Enter or the Tab key to
lock it in. For several years now, having the addresses I want to appear has
become less dependable. Consequently, I have become more diligent about
maintaining my Contacts list. It’s not very time-consuming, and also preferable
to losing addresses and then having to ask somebody else for them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two ways to create a new contact. You can create
one from scratch, or you can grab it from a message you have received. The
latter way is faster and easier.</p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'><br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>To create a
contact from scratch:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Contacts folder by pressing Control Y, pressing C until you
hear Contacts, and then pressing Enter. You can get there more quickly by
pressing Control 3.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control N to open the New contact dialog box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in the full name of the contact. This is a required field.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab past two unrequired fields (company and job title) to the File as
edit combo box. By default, the contact is filed with the last name first. You
can change this to first name first, or type something else in. This last
possibility could be useful if the contact is a name of a person or a company
with three words or more, and you want to make sure it is listed with the
correct word first. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to the Email edit field and type in the email address.
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab one more time to the Display as edit field and type in the address
as you would like it to appear when addressing a message. This is useful
because when addresses autofill correctly, they will do so based on what you
type in here. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To save the contact, press the Escape key once and you will be asked
whether you want to save your changes. Press the Spacebar to confirm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are many more fields you could fill in, but I limit
myself here to the email address.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have received a message from somebody, it is faster
and easier to create a new contact by getting the address from a message. To do
this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open a message sent to you by the person whose address you want to add
to your Contacts list.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab to the From field where that person’s name and/or email
address appears. Note that, even if all you hear is the person’s name, what we
are about to do will still work.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the name or email address You can do this by pressing Control A,
or by pressing Home to get to the start of the From field and then pressing
Shift End to select the address.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to Add to Outlook contacts, and
press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in the Full name edit field that is pre-populated with the
person’s name. Edit it if it does not appear as a full name.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Escape key and you will be asked if you want to save the
contact. Press Enter or the Spacebar to confirm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alternatively, you can save and close the contact by
pressing Alt S. It’s that easy. The Email edit field and Display As fields have
already been filled. You are returned to the address field in the message where
you first selected the address. Press Escape to exit the message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not only is this fast, but you do not have to worry about
typing in names and email addresses correctly. I have a friend with a last name
that is impossible to spell, at least for me. It would take me forever to type
in her name and email address correctly. But I don’t have to worry about this
if I create her contact from a message I have already received from her. </p>

<h3>4.6.2 Creating Contact Groups in Outlook</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can create a single contact for a group of people, thus
saving you the time of having to find a bunch of individual addresses and
laboriously entering each one into the To field. Use the method below for small
groups of five to ten people. The groups should be stable. Members should
rarely enter or leave the group. This is because making changes to an existing
Contact group is complicated. For larger and more fluid groups, I recommend
using the Excel method described in the next section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is a hard way and an easy way to create a Contact
Group. I will only cover the easy way. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have already sent a message to all the people you
want to be in the Contact group, navigate to this message in your Sent items
folder. Alternatively, if you have received a message that contains all these
email addresses in your inbox, prepare a Reply to all message to them,
replacing the original Subject field text with “Test – please disregard.” Send
the message and navigate to it in your Sent items folder. If you have neither
of these, address a message to all of these people, type “Test – please disregard”
in the Subject field, send it, and navigate to it in your Sent items folder.
Remaining steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the message and Shift tab to the To field where all these addresses
are contained.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control A to select all the addresses, and Control C to copy them
to the Clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press escape to get out of the message.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control 3 to get into the Contacts folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to go to the Home tab of the Upper ribbon of your Contacts
folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab twice to the New Contact Group button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Untitled Contact Group edit field, type in the name you want to
give to the Contact group. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to Members list and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to Select members contacts and press Control V to
paste in the addresses.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Tab
to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>11.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Press
Escape and you will be asked if you want to save your changes. Press the
Spacebar to confirm. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>12.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>To
test this, prepare a new message, typing in the first few letters of the
Contact group name and confirm that the To field autofills with it. </p>

<h3>4.6.3 Creating Contact Groups from Excel </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To address Outlook messages to larger groups, and where
members frequently join or leave the group, it is easier to keep a list of the
email addresses in Excel rather than using Outlook contact Groups. You can then
copy the addresses from Excel and paste them into one of the Outlook address
fields. Only minimum knowledge of Excel is needed. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Excel file with the relevant email addresses listed in one of
the columns. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Move your cursor to place focus on the cell with the first address. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift Down arrow together to select from this address to
the last address in the column. Alternatively, you can press Shift Down arrow
repeatedly to select each individual address.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy the addresses. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Alt Tab to the Outlook Inbox if it is already open. Otherwise, open
Outlook. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control N to prepare a new message.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control V to paste the addresses in the To field. Alternatively,
Tab to the BCC field and press Control V if you want to paste them there (see
Chapter 4.1.4 on how to add the BCC field to messages). Note that semi-colons
are automatically placed between the addresses to separate them. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Prepare the rest of the message. When finished, press Alt S or Control
Enter to send it.</p>

<h2>4.7 The Outlook Calendar </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can use the Outlook Calendar for scheduling events. In
this section, I will use the following nomenclature. An event is a collective
term for appointments and meetings. An appointment is an event that you
schedule for yourself only. A meeting is an event that you schedule with
others. In some work settings (like the Carroll Center for the Blind where I
work), use of the Outlook Calendar is required for scheduling meetings. You can
also synchronize (“sync” for short) events with your smartphone if you have
one. I will first cover how to access the Calendar to see what events you have
on it. After that, I will discuss how to schedule events. </p>

<h3>4.7.1 Accessing the Calendar</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can either navigate to the Calendar folder via the tree
view, or by pressing Control 2. There are four Calendar views that appear
differently on the screen for sighted users. These are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Day view: the screen is filled with a single day with lines for
30 minute increments (8:00 Am to 8:30 AM, 8:30 AM to 9:00 AM, etc.). The
shortcut key for this view is Control Alt 1.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Work week view: the screen contains five panes for Monday through
Friday, each of which has lines for 30 minute increments. The shortcut key is
Control Alt 2.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Full week view: the screen contains seven panes for all days of
the week, each of which has lines for 30 minute increments. The shortcut key is
Control Alt 3.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Month View: A grid is presented with five rows of seven days
(Sunday through Saturday). No time increments are visible within the days. The
shortcut key is Control Alt 4.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For screen reader users, navigating the Day, Work week, and
Full week views is exactly the same. Within a day, up and Down arrow to go back
and forward by 30 minute increments. Left and Right arrow to go back a day and
forward a day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the Month view, moving by single days is the same as for
the other views: Left and Right arrowing goes back a day and forward a day.
However, up and Down arrowing goes back a week and forward a week. And pressing
Page up and Page down goes back five weeks and forward five weeks. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In any of these views, you can press the Tab key to go
forward to the next event, and Shift Tab to go back an event. When you do this,
you will hear the name of the event, time and date, and name of the organizer.
If it is a recurring event, this will also be indicated. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you wish to delete an event, you can press the Delete key
after tabbing to it. No confirmation request will be heard. It will simply
disappear, so be careful before doing this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you press Enter after tabbing to an event, you will be
placed in the event’s dialog box and you can edit it. When finished editing,
press the Escape key and then press Enter to confirm you want to save the
revisions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I mentioned above that the within-day default time increment
is 30 minutes. You can change this if you like. My personal preference is 60
minutes, which saves me a lot of arrowing around. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in the Calendar folder, press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, and
Tab to the View tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Lower ribbon, Tab to the Time scale submenu and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You first land on 60 minutes. Other options are 30, 15 and 10 minutes.
Press Enter or the Spacebar on your choice.</p>

<h3>4.7.2 Creating Appointments</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned above, an appointment is an event you schedule
for yourself only. There are several ways to do this. I will cover three of
them.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Calendar folder and press Control Alt 1 to access the Day View.
You could also pick the Work week or Full week view, but I will stick with the
Day view here. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the day and time for the meeting by Left and Right arrowing
to move by day, and Up and Down arrowing to move by time increments within a
day. As an example, I will schedule an appointment on May 23 at 1:00 PM.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control N which opens the Appointment dialog box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You first land in the Title edit field. Type in the name of your
appointment.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Start date field which is already populated with the date you
navigated to in the Day View.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Start time field, already populated with the date you
navigated to in the Day View.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the End date field, already populated with the same day.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the End time field, populated with the time 30 minutes after the
start time. If you want to change this, you can Down arrow by half hour
increments. If the time is other than a 30 minute increment, you can type it
in, for example 145 for 1:45 PM. You do not have to type in the colons. Outlook
is usually smart enough to guess whether the time is AM or PM. But you can also
type in P or A for PM or Am, as in 145p for 1:45 PM. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab past the Recurring button (which is present in Outlook 365 only, and
I will deal with recurring events later) to the Location edit combo box. Type
in a location if you like. Note that this is optional for appointments.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Tab
to the Edit field where you can type in notes. This is also optional. Note that
you must Press Shift Tab to get out of this field. Pressing the Tab key will
only Insert tabs into the text here. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>11.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Press
either Alt S or the Escape key. If you press the Escape key, you will be asked
if you want to save your changes. Press the Spacebar to confirm. The
appointment is now entered in your Calendar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are two other ways to access the Appointments dialog
box. With both of these you will need to manually type in date and tine
information. If you are already situated in the Calendar folder, do the
following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to New appointment and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in the Title edit field. Type in the name of your appointment.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Start date edit field. It is prepopulated with today’s
date. If the appointment is not for today, type the date in MM/DD/YY format. If
the date is not too far off in the future, you can also Down arrow day by day
to the desired start date.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Start time edit field, and type it in, for example typing
315p for 3:15 PM.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Follow steps 6 through 11 above to fill out the rest of the appointment
information and save it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From anywhere in Outlook, you can press Control Shift A to
get into the Appointments dialog box. Once again, you first land in the Title
edit field. Complete the steps enumerated above to create an appointment. </p>

<h3>4.7.3 Scheduling Meetings</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>In essence, scheduling a meeting involves creating an
appointment and converting it into an email that you send to invitees. You can
do this in three ways. I will cover these in the same order I covered
appointments above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first way:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Complete steps one through eight above.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Location edit combo box. While technically optional, common
sense dictates that you should identify a location so invitees know where the
meeting will take place.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Notes Edit field. This will become the message body for the
email invitation. You might type in welcoming remarks, insert the meeting
agenda, or other pertinent information. Or you might leave this field blank if
invitees already have the information they need for the meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Alt key to open the ribbon menu. You land on the Appointments
tab. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon to the Invite attendees button and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in the Required field. Type in the email addresses of those you
wish to invite. These addressees will appear in the To field of the email
message you are about to send. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Optional field and type in addresses of those for whom
attendance is optional. Most of the time, you will probably not use this field.
These addressees will appear in the CC field.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Continue tabbing. All the fields are populated with the date, time,
location and message field information you have already entered. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Enter or Alt S to send the email message to invitees.
Meeting information will now be placed in your Outlook calendar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are already in the Calendar folder:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to New meeting request and press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in the Title edit field. Type in the name of the meeting</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Required field. Type in the email addresses of those you wish
to invite.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Optional field and type in addresses of those for whom
attendance is optional. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the remaining fields to type in start dates, start and end times,
and message body text.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Enter or Alt S to send the email message to invitees.
Meeting information will now be placed in your Outlook calendar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, from anywhere in Outlook, you can press Control
Shift Q and follow the same steps as directly above to prepare and send an
email invitation. </p>

<h3>4.7.4 Responding to Meeting Requests</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you receive an Outlook meeting invitation, there are
several methods for responding to the meeting organizer. The quickest and
easiest is to:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Arrow to the email in your inbox without opening it. Your screen reader
says “meeting request” to indicate that it is not a standard email message. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to Accept, and press Enter. Other
choices are Tentative and Decline. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After pressing Accept, you land on an OK button. Press Enter on this if
you wish to send a confirmation without writing a response message. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, tab twice to a set of three radio buttons where you can arrow
up or down to select one of two additional choices: Edit the response before
sending, or Don’t send a response. If you choose the first of these, you will
be placed in an edit box where you can type the text of a response and send it.
If you choose the second option, the meeting will be moved to your Calendar and
the organizer will not be notified. You might choose this option if, say, this
is a mandatory meeting called by your boss and you do not want to clutter his
or her Inbox with an unnecessary confirmation message. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you have accepted the invitation, the meeting
information will be moved to your Outlook Calendar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alternatively, from inside the message you can Shift Tab
several times to the Accept button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the meeting location and/or date and time are not
mentioned in the subject or body of the invitation message, Shift Tab a couple
of times to hear the meeting location. Shift Tab one more time to hear the
proposed date and time. </p>

<h3>4.7.5 Recurring Events</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To schedule appointments or meetings that repeat on a
regular basis, you can schedule them recurrently rather than one by one. To
save space, I will only cover this using the Control Shift Q quick key option
for scheduling meetings. I will set a recurrence patteron of one meeting every
week. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift Q to get into the Create Meeting dialog box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Fill in meeting name, invitees, start and end date and time, location
and the message body fields as outlined above. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If using Outlook 365, and assuming you have filled in the information above
and your cursor is located in the Message body edit field, Shift Tab back to
the Make recurring button and press the Spacebar to open the Recurrence dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you are instead using Outlook 2019 or an earlier version, from any
location within this dialog, press Alt to open the Upper ribbon. You land on
the Meetings tab. Tab into the Lower ribbon to the Recurrence button and press
Enter to open this dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Recurrence pattern radio button which is weekly by default.
You can up or Down arrow to other choices which include monthly, yearly, and
daily. We will stick with weekly for this example. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Recur every edit box which is set at 1 by default. You could
type 2 or 3 over this if you wanted your meeting to recur once every two or
three weeks. We will stick with 1 here.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab through the Recurrence pattern checkboxes for each of the seven days
of the week. Press the Spacebar for those days you want checked. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Range of recurrence End by radio buttons and up or Down arrow
to your choice. These are: End by – Gives you the option to pick a terminal
date; End after Gives you the option to pick a total number of occurrences; and
No end date – Although this sounds like forever, it expires after one year,
beyond which you will need to create the appointment/meeting again. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Hlk63430870">9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you choose End by, when you Tab once, a default date calculated as
ten occurrences from and including the start date is specified. Type in a new
date if this is not the one you want. If instead you choose End after, when you
Tab once, a default of ten occurrences is specified. Type in a different number
if you want. </a></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Tab
to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>11.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Press
Alt S or Control Enter to send the meeting invitation to the invitees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about scheduling recurrent events with a monthly
pattern of some sort? I am a member of the Visually Impaired and Blind User
Group (VIBUG), a Boston area group that meets from 1:00 to 3:00 PM on the
second Saturday of every month. To set up this recurrence pattern. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat steps one through four above to set the start date and time of
day, and get to the Recurrence dialog. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Recurrence pattern radio button, and Down arrow to monthly</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to where you have a choice of two radio buttons – day or The.
“Day” means some specific day of the month, for example, the 12<sup>th</sup> or
15<sup>th</sup>. “The” means the third Thursday or second Saturday of the
month. For this example, we want to choose “The,” so Up or Down arrow to The.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to an edit combo box, whose choices are, first, second, third,
fourth, and last. For this example, Down arrow to Second. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to a combo box listing the days of the week, and Down arrow to
Saturday.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to an edit box where a default of one is present, indicating
that this event will occur every month. If the event were to be scheduled every
two or three months, you would instead type 2 or 3 here.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat steps eight through eleven above to set terminal dates, save the
appointment, and send the invitation if you are organizing a meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the recurrence pattern were every second and fourth
Saturday of the month, you would need to create these as two separate events.
It is not possible to create it as a single recurrent event. </p>

<h3>4.7.6 Canceling Appointments and Meetings</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps are slightly different for canceling appointments and
meetings, as well as for recurrent events. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To cancel a single appointment, Tab or Shift Tab to it in
one of the Calendar views, and press the Delete key. There is no prompt to
confirm. The appointment is simply deleted from your Calendar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To cancel a recurrent appointment:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab or Shift Tab to the appointment in one of the Calendar views, and
press the Delete key. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land on an OK button where you receive the following prompt: “Do       u
want to delete all occurrences of the recurring appointment, or just this one?”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To delete just this occurrence, press the Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To delete the entire series, Tab twice to the Delete this occurrence
radio button, and Up or Down arrow once to the Delete the series radio button
and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The above process can be confusing because the first time
you Tab, you land on the Cancel button. However, this is for canceling this
process, not for canceling the event itself. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The process for cancelling meetings is slightly more
complicated because of the need to alert invitees of the cancellation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To cancel a single meeting:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Hlk89955240">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab or Shift Tab to the meeting in one of the Calendar views, and press
the Delete key. </a></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Escape key. You will receive the prompt: “Do you want to
cancel this meeting?” </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Be careful here. You land on a rather deceptive OK button. Pressing the
Spacebar here will not cancel the meeting. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To actually cancel the meeting, Tab twice to the No, don’t cancel radio
button, Up or Down arrow once to Yes send a cancellation radio button and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To cancel a single meeting in a recurrent series of
meetings:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Hlk90033567">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In one of the Calendar views, Tab or Shift Tab to the meeting you want
to cancel and press the Delete key. </a></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Escape key. You receive the prompt: “Do     u want to delete
all occurrences of the recurring appointment, or just this one?”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To delete just this occurrence, press the Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Be careful here. You are not finished. Press the Escape key once. You
land on an OK button. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab twice to the No, don’t cancel radio button, Up or Down arrow once to
Yes send a cancellation radio button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Meeting invitees will now receive an email alerting them to
the cancellation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To cancel an entire series of recurrent meetings:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In one of the Calendar views, Tab or Shift Tab to any of the meetings in
the series, and press the Delete key. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Escape key. You receive the prompt: “Do you want to delete all
occurrences of the recurring appointment, or just this one?”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab twice to the Delete this occurrence radio button, and Up or Down
arrow once to the Delete the series radio button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Escape key once. You land on an OK button and are asked if you
want to cancel this meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab twice to the No, don’t cancel radio button, Up or Down arrow once to
Yes send a cancellation radio button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Invitees are now sent an email alerting them that the series
of meetings has been canceled. </p>

<h3>4.7.7 Dismissing Event Reminders</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you have one or more appointments or meetings in your
Calendar, When you open Outlook, reminders will pop up for events coming
shortly, as well as for past events. If you do not dismiss these, repeated
reminders will soon annoy you as more and more past events accumulate. If you
wish to dismiss them, as soon as they pop up, Tab to the Dismiss button for an
individual event, or the Dismiss all button for multiple ones, and press the
Spacebar to dismiss them. </p>

<h2>4.8 Other Folders</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>So far in this chapter, I have discussed the Inbox, Sent
items, and Contacts folders. Other important folders worth covering are Drafts,
Spam or Junk, and Deleted items or Trash. Press Control Y to access them via the
tree view, navigating it as outlined in Chapter 4.3.</p>

<h3>4.8.1 Drafts Folder</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have started preparing a message but don’t have time
to finish and send it, you can save it to the Drafts folder by pressing Escape.
You will then be asked if you want to save your changes. Press Enter or the
Spacebar on the Yes button to save it to the Drafts folder. Later, you can
navigate to the Drafts folder to complete the message and send it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned in Chapter 4.3 above, if you are using a Gmail
IMAP account, you may encounter two Drafts folders: an empty superfluous one at
level 1 of the tree view, and the “real” one at level 2 after you open the
Gmail folder. This level 2 folder is where you will find your draft messages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I try to avoid using the Drafts folder for several reasons.
For many people, including me, the Drafts folder functions poorly. When I go
into a draft message, make my revisions, and attempt to send it, all too often,
I get the message, “The operation can not be performed because the message has
been changed.” The only way I can get away from this message is to close
Outlook and reopen it. Although I am not sure, this may be a problem unique to
Gmail accounts. Be sure to see if this behavior occurs on your own computer
before investing much time in composing drafts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When this happens with my Gmail account, to complete the
draft message and send it, I have to perform a strange workaround. Rather than
opening it and making revisions, I press Enter on the draft message and
immediately press the Escape key without pressing any other keys. I then press
Enter again, make my revisions, and send it. This works most of the time, but I
don’t entirely trust that it will, so generally avoid using this folder
altogether. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also find editing messages a bit awkward. The Spellcheck
utility in Outlook is less consistent than in Word, at least for me. Because of
these problems, I prefer to prepare the body of my messages in Word and save
them there, especially if they are long messages and proper formatting is
important. When I am ready to send the message, I address a new message, type
in a subject, copy and paste the text from my Word document into the body of
the email message, and send it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One other thing you should keep in mind if you are going to
use the Drafts folder. Because you have not yet sent the message, the newest
draft message you have started will not necessarily be at the top of your
Drafts folder list. Be sure to not keep an excessive number of drafts, or you
will have a hard time finding the one you just started. Delete all draft
messages that you no longer need. If you have already addressed the draft
message, you can sort messages by “To,” that is, who the message is being sent
to, and then first-letter navigate to the intended recipient. </p>

<h3>4.8.2 Deleted Items or Trash Folder</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you press the Delete key on a message, it is moved to
the Deleted items or Trash folder. It is not permanently deleted. If you want
to retrieve a deleted message, navigate to the folder via the tree view, and
copy or move it back to the desired folder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As with Drafts, there may be a superfluous Deleted items
folder at level 1 of the tree view, and a “real” one at level 2 of your Gmail
folder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can empty the Deleted items folder using the following
steps:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F I to open the Info tab. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to a combo box listing the accounts you have installed in
Outlook. Arrow up or down to the account for which you want to delete all
messages.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Tools settings submenu and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Empty Deleted items folder and press Enter. Your screen
reader will say, “Everything in the Trash folder will be deleted. Continue. Yes
button.” Press Enter or the Spacebar to confirm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To save some keystrokes, I prefer instead to define a quick
key for doing this in the Quick Access toolbar (see Chapter 10.3.2 on how to do
this). </p>

<h3>4.8.3 Spam or Junk Folder</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Outlook will automatically divert messages it determines to
be nuisance emails to your Junk or Spam folder. Gmail accounts call this folder
“Spam” while other account types may call it “Junk.” On occasion, Outlook
mistakenly places messages there that you actually want in your Inbox. It is a
good practice to visit your Junk or Spam folder every few days to doublecheck
if important messages have not been mistakenly diverted there. You should also
delete all unwanted messages to clean up this folder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For senders whose messages you do not want diverted to the
Junk folder, Options exist for preventing this. You can also block certain
senders whose messages you don’t want landing in your Inbox. You can do this
from the Inbox, Deleted items or Junk folder. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow to a message from a relevant sender.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to the Junk submenu, and press
Enter to open it. This submenu is referred to as “Junk” even if your account
type calls it “Spam.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the appropriate option and press Enter. Choices are block
sender, never block sender, never block sender’s domain, and never block this
group or mailing list. If you are in the Junk folder, “not junk” is another
option. If you choose this last option, you will be asked for confirmation to
move the message back into the Inbox. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While this is useful, I have not found it to be an airtight
guarantee that such designations will stick in the future. For senders I do not
want to block, overkill may be a wise strategy. Select all three options: never
block sender, never block sender’s domain, and never block this group or
mailing list. Try the Not Junk option also. Even then, don’t assume it will
always work. The best strategy is to visit this folder every few days to be
sure that messages from individual senders and mailing lists who matter to you
are not being diverted there. </p>

<h2>4.9 Other Useful Tools</h2>

<h3>4.9.1 Turning Off the Reading pane</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Reading pane can cause message lists to misbehave in a
couple of ways. It can visually hide parts of messages, causing them to read
incorrectly. Down arrowing can make the unread message labels disappear even
though you have not opened these messages. If you encounter these problems, you
will want to be sure that the Reading pane is turned off. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, and Right arrow to the View tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Reading pane submenu and press Enter (the shortcut key is Alt
V P N).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Off and press Enter or the Spacebar to uncheck it. If it
is already unchecked, pressing Enter or the Spacebar will not uncheck it. </p>

<h3>4.9.2 Turning Off New Message Notifications</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>By default, whenever a new message arrives in your Inbox,
your screen reader will announce the sender and subject. This may be
distracting and can violate your privacy if people nearby hear the
announcement. To turn this off:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, Left arrow to the File Tab, Down
arrow to Options and press Enter (shortcut key Alt F T).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Category list, Down arrow once to Mail.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to the Message arrival sound checkbox which is checked
by default. I like to keep this one on. You will hear a “boing” when messages
arrive, but no more that that.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Show an envelope icon in the Taskbar checkbox and press the
Spacebar to uncheck it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Display a desktop alert checkbox and press the Spacebar to
uncheck it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab back to the OK button and press the Spacebar. You could Tab
instead, but this is an extremely lengthy dialog box. Shift tabbing is much
faster.</p>

<h3>4.9.3 Creating a Signature</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A signature is text that appears at the bottom of every
message you send. In a job setting, signatures are commonly used to display
contact information. People sometimes add signatures with a few lines of a
favorite song lyric or to provide some other personal touch. I don’t much care
for this latter type of signature. They are often a bit too smarmy for my
taste. Constant repetition from the same person gets old fast. Never use such
signatures in professional and academic settings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While it is possible to format text and insert it into the
Signature dialog box, it is much easier to first prepare it in Word. Here are
the steps:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Prepare your text in Word, press Control A to select all, and press
Control C to copy the text to the clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Outlook, press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, Left arrow to the File
Tab, Down arrow to Options and press Enter (shortcut key Alt F T).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Category list, Down arrow once to Mail.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to the Signatures' button and press the spacebar. This
opens the Signatures dialog box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the New button and press the spacebar. Focus is placed in the
Name edit field. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in a name for your signature (for example, “Work” if you are
creating it for your job), and press enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='page-break-after:avoid'>7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tab to the 'new
messages' combo box. Down arrow to the name of your new signature. There is
often a delay here, so you may need to Down arrow several times until you hear
it. This will insert the signature at the bottom of all new messages you
prepare.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the 'replies and forwards' combo box. Down arrow to the name of
your new signature. Here too, there might be a slight delay. This will insert
the signature at the bottom of all replies and forwarded messages you prepare.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab multiple times to the Edit Signature edit field. It is just before
the OK button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Press
Control V to paste your signature from the Clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>11.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Tab
to the OK button and press the spacebar. Focus will be back in the Options
dialog box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>12.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Press
the Escape key to exit this dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To test that your signature has been added, press Control N
to prepare a new message. Tab to the body of the message and Down arrow. The
signature should now appear at the bottom of the message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Excel is a powerful application for organizing,
manipulating, and analyzing data. It is an essential tool in many work and
academic environments, and can be used for managing personal information. Just
a few examples of common uses include:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Budget preparation and monitoring</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tracking inventory</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tabulating and analyzing survey data</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Maintaining contact lists</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I often advise my trainees to use Excel for anything that
involves crunching numbers or making lists. While it is possible to do these
things in Word, Excel is more flexible and powerful for performing these tasks.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While reading this chapter (as well as when working in
Excel), you should set your screen reader punctuation level at most or all.
Setting it at some or none will fail to detect a number of punctuation marks
like parentheses, colons, and a few more that are important in the syntax for
creating formulas. To change punctuation levels for the three screen readers,
see Chapter 8.1.1 for JAWS, 8.2.2 for NVDA, and 8.3.1 for Narrator.</p>

<h2>5.1 The Basics</h2>

<h3>5.1.1 Terminology</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>A spreadsheet is
a document that stores data in a grid of horizontal rows and vertical columns.
Rows are usually labeled using numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.), while columns are
usually labeled with letters (A, B, C, etc.). Individual row/column locations,
such as C3 or B12, are referred to as cells, and each has a cell coordinate.
For example, cell A3 is located in the first column and third row, cell E10 is
located in the fifth column and tenth row, and so on. “Spreadsheet” is a
generic term for any such document or file, including, but not limited to
Excel. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An Excel file is called a workbook and may be composed of
anywhere from one to a large number of sheets or worksheets. Think of a sheet
as a page.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>Until
you rename them, they are assigned the generic names “Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3,
etc.” Worksheets are where information is entered and manipulated in a
workbook. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing style='margin-bottom:8.0pt;line-height:107%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>When
you first open a new blank Excel file, and press Insert T to hear its title,
you will hear “Book1, Sheet 1, A1.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>A blank
spreadsheet is a vast area with thousands of columns and over one million rows.
Columns and rows are labelled with letters and numbers, respectively. A </span>cell
reference or cell coordinate is expressed as its letter and number combination.
For example, cell A1 is located in the first column and first row, cell C5 is
located in the third column and fifth row, and so on. A “data range” refers to
a group of contiguous cells. For example, the data range from B2 through B9
refers to the cells containing B2, B9 and all the cells in between in this
column. A data range can also be a rectangular block of cells. The data range
of B2 through F9 includes the rectangular block of cells with B2 located at the
top left, B9 at the bottom left, F2 at the top right, and F9 at the bottom
right. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>Three types of
data can be entered in cells: text, numbers, or formulas. Numbers may be
expressed as simple numbers, currency, dates, percentages, or in several other
formats. </span>Formulas are calculations referencing cell references or
numbers from elsewhere on the spreadsheet. For example, if numbers are
contained in columns A and B, a formula can be typed in column C to total the
numbers in the respective rows of columns A and B. However, in composing the
formula, you would usually not type in the actual numbers in those cells, but
rather the corresponding cell coordinates. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Formulas can be very simple or quite complex. More on
formulas below. </p>

<h3>5.1.2 entering Data and Navigating Spreadsheets</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use the arrow keys to move one cell at a time among the
column’s and rows of the spreadsheet. The Up and Down arrows move up and down
columns. The left and Right arrows move across rows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After typing data in a cell, pressing any of the arrow keys
will conserve that data in the cell and move the cursor focus to the next cell
in the direction that you just arrowed. You can also press the Tab key to move
one cell to the right, equivalent to pressing the Right arrow key. In addition,
pressing the Enter key will conserve the data and move the cursor one cell
below. If you type in data and press the Escape key, none of the data you just
typed will be conserved. If you sense that you have made a typing error,
immediately press the Escape key to prevent replacing correct data with the
mistaken keystroke. Failing to do this is a common frustration for beginners. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From anywhere on a spreadsheet, pressing Control Home moves
the cursor focus to cell A1, the top left corner of the spreadsheet. Pressing
Control End places the cursor focus on the cell that is the intersection of the
right-most column with at least one cell containing data, and the bottom-most
row with at least one cell containing data. For example, if the right-most cell
with data is F32 and the bottom-most cell with data is A 47, pressing Control
End will place cursor focus on cell F47. This keystroke is especially useful
for exploring a spreadsheet that you did not prepare yourself. If pressing
Control End lands the cursor in cell F47, you know that all data in the sheet
are located between A1 and F47. There are no data to the right of column F, nor
below row 47. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While using the four arrow keys to navigate one cell at a
time is useful for navigating in small areas, you can navigate quickly over
large blocks of filled and unfilled cells by pressing the Control key in
combination with the four arrow keys. This is referred to as “navigating by
region.” A region is a range of cells that contain data and are bordered by
blank cells. It is synonymous with a data range. </p>

<h3>5.1.3 Simple Formulas</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are three categories of formulas:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Those containing operators which are the keys for adding,
subtracting, multiplying, and dividing data from two or more specified cells.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Those containing functions for making calculations over a range
of data. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>And those containing a combination of operators and functions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>Let’s begin by
typing the numbers 1000 in cell A1 and 250 in cell A2. Don’t type in a comma
separator in 1000. Under this data, we will input several of the simplest and
most common formulas. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>All formulas
begin with the equal sign, signaling to Excel that a formula is being entered
in the cell. The equal sign is located two keys to the right of the zero key on
the number row of your keyboard. When you type the equal sign, your screen
reader will say “type in a formula and press Enter.” We will start with simple
formulas using operators for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing two
numbers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Addition: In cell A3, type in
“=A1+A2,” minus the quotes, and press Enter to go down one row. Press Shift
Equal (again, two keys to the right of zero on the number row) to make the plus
sign. Up arrow once and you will hear “1250 has formula A3.” Your screen reader
first says the result, then indicates this is a formula so you know it is not
just a typed-in number. Then you hear the cell coordinate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Subtraction: In cell A4, type
in “=A1-A2,” minus the quotes, and press Enter. The dash is one key to the
right of zero on the number row. Up arrow once and you will hear “750 has
formula A4.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Multiplication: In cell A5,
type in “=A1*A2,” minus the quotes, and press Enter. Press Shift 8 on the
number row to make the asterisk sign. Up arrow once and you will hear “250000
has formula A5.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Division: In cell A6, type in
“=A1/A2,” minus the quotes, and press Enter. The Slash key is just below the
semicolon on the Home row. Up arrow once and you will hear “4 has formula A6.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>Now we will cover
formulas using some of the most frequently-used functions, including those for
calculating the sum and average of values in a column, and finding the minimum
and maximum values in that column. These formulas have a three-component structure:
the equal sign, short text indicating the function to be calculated, and the
data range upon winch that function will be performed. Because we have data in
all the cells from A1 through A6, we will use this data range. To make it
easier to read the text, I will put the formula on its own line and then
explain it on the next line.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>In cell A7, type:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>=sum(A1:A6)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>This totals the
values in the column from cell A1 through cell A6. The three components of the
formula are: </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>The equal sign
indicating that this is a formula.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>The text of the
function “sum” indicating that this is the calculation to be executed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>The data range,
written beginning with a left parentheses, the first cell in the data range, a
colon indicating “through,” the last cell in the data range, and a right
parenthesis ending the designation of the data range.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>In cell A8, type:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>=average(A1:A6)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>This calculates
the average value (also knows as the mean) of the data range from A1 through
A6.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>In cell A9, type:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>=min(A1:A6)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>This identifies
the minimum value in the data range from A1 through A6.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>In cell A10,
type:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>=max(A1:A6)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>This identifies
the maximum value in the data range from A1 through A6.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>Excel has a vast

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In cell A1, type “Monthly Expenses for the Smith Family for the Year,”
minus the quotes. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “Expense” in cell A2, minus the quotes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In column A, from cells A3 to cell A10, list the following eight expense
categories: Water, Electricity, Groceries, Cell phone, Cable, Rent,
Transportation, and Entertainment. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In cell A11, type “Monthly Total,” minus the quotes. We will eventually
sum the monthly columns along row 11. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In row 2, starting in cell B2, type in the months of the year across
this row, with January in cell B2, February in cell C2, and so on until
December in cell M2.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In cell N2, type “Annual Total,” minus the quotes. We will eventually
sum the rows to calculate the annual amount for each type of bill </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not counting the name of the table at the top, most basic
data tables are composed of three parts:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Row headers: Text going down the left column. In this case, the
types of bills. “Electricity” is a row header because the data along that row
relate to electricity bills. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Column headers: Text going across the top row of the table. In
this case, each of the twelve months and the last column totaling the year.
“January ” is a column header because all the cost data down the January column
relate to bill costs for that month. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Table body: To the right of the first column and under the top
row is where data appear. If data are numeric (simple numbers, dollars,
percentages, etc.), they are referred to as “values.” In this table, each
monthly bill expense will be entered. </p>

<h3>5.2.2 Define Names – A Feature That Makes Using Excel Much Easier</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>After you have typed in your row and column headers, it is
time to introduce an Excel feature that greatly improves readability of tables
for screen reader users on the PC. When I show this feature to a screen reader
user who has been struggling with Excel for a long time, he or she usually has
one of those head-slapping “I wish I had known about this years ago” moments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sighted users can easily interpret Data in the body of a
table. Let’s say the number 750 appears in cell E8 of this table. With a quick
glance, a sighted user can determine that this number corresponds to the cost
of rent for April. However, a screen reader user would need to Up arrow several
times to the top of the column to find April, Down arrow back to 750, and then Left
arrow back to column A to figure this out. This is time-consuming in even a
small table like this one. It is much worse with larger tables. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using the Define Names feature largely eliminates this
problem. As you move cell by cell along a row, you will hear the column header
and content for each cell,. As you move cell by cell up or down a column, you
will hear the row header and content for each cell. With the JAWS Eloquence
voice, column and row headers are spoken in a lower pitch than the cell data. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To activate this feature correctly, you must start with your
focus in the cell that is the intersection of the row and column headers you
want read as you move around in the body of the table. Most of the time, this
will be the cell in the top left corner of your table. This does not mean the
name or title you gave the table, located in the row above in cell A1. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this table, the types of expenses are listed down column
A and the months of the year are listed along row 2. The top left cell of the
table is cell A2, so this is where your cursor must be situated in order to
begin the process of defining names. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As explained above, navigate to the cell that is the intersection of the
column and row headers you want read as you navigate inside the table. In this
case, move to cell A2.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow twice to Define Name, and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in the word “title,” minus the quotes, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To test it out, move around inside the table. As you move right and
left, you should hear the column headers and cell content. As you move up and
down, you should hear row headers and cell content. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is an Excel feature, so works equally well with any of
the screen readers covered in this book. When you save the file, title reading
will also be saved. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While you can activate this feature at any time, I get it
going as early as possible when constructing a table. It makes all subsequent
actions (data entry, navigation, creating formulas, editing, etc.) much easier
and less prone to error. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For some tables, you may not want to hear both column and
row headers as you navigate, but just one or the other. For example, think of a
bus schedule where the stops are listed along row 2,and down column A are the
times of the first bus in the morning. In this case, hearing the row headers
(that is, the time of the first bus) and times in the middle of the table as
you up and Down arrow, would only be confusing. In this case, you would only
want column headers read to you as you move left and right along rows. To hear
only column headers:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the leftmost cell in the row where the column headers are
located (usually the top row of the table, not counting the row with the table
name).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow twice to Define Name, and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in the single word “columntitle,” minus the quotes and with no
spaces between column and title, and press Enter. Note that this is not
case-sensitive. If you like, you can instead write it as “ColumnTitle,” with
the C and T capitalized so your screen reader says it normally. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To test it out, move around inside the table. As you move right and
left, you should hear the column headers and cell content. As you move up and
down, you should only hear cell content, and no row headers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To only hear row headers:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the cell just above the topmost row header you want read,
usually near the top of column A. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow twice to Define Name, and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in the single word “rowtitle,” minus the quotes and with no space
between row and title, and press Enter. Here too, use upper case for R and T if
you prefer it to read normally. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To test it out, move around inside the table. As you move up and down,
you should hear the row headers and cell content. As you move left and right,
you should only hear cell content, and no column headers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You also need to know how to delete these for a couple of
reasons. First, if you mistakenly start the above steps from the wrong cell,
table reading may become incomprehensible. You must first delete any previous
title reading designations before you can correct them. Second, sometimes in
the course of editing spreadsheets, you may delete some rows or columns. This
may cause title reading to no longer work. Here too, you will need to delete
whatever you first put in before you can redo them. You can start this process
from anywhere in the spreadsheet. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, and Right arrow to the Formulas tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon about ten times to the Name manager button and
press Enter. The shortcut key is Control F3.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in a combo box where any Define name settings you have created
for that file are listed. Assuming you only have one, your cursor focus lands
on it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Delete key. You are asked for a deletion confirmation.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Spacebar to confirm, and Escape to return to your spreadsheet.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is also possible to define column and row headers for
several tables on the same sheet. You will need to do this to avoid confusion.
If, for example you have defined names for a table beginning near the top left
of the sheet, and you then add more tables below or to the right of this first
table, the column and row headers of the first table will be read as you
navigate within these other tables. You will then hear the wrong column and row
headers read. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To define names for the first table on a worksheet with two
tables, you need to specify the data range of that table. The column and row
headers specified will only be operative within this data range, and will not
interfere with reading column and row headers for any tables outside this data
range. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Using our current table as an example, the top left corner
of the data range is cell A2. Because the furthest right column is column N,
and the bottom row is row 11, cell N11 is the bottom right cell of the data
range. Steps for defining names for this data range are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to cell A2, the top left cell of the data range. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow twice to Define Name, and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in “title..N11” here. After the word title, you type in two periods
and then the bottom right cell coordinate of the data range. Now press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To test it out, move around inside the A2-N11 data range where you will
hear column and row headers. Now move the cursor outside this data range (to
the right of column M or below row 11), you will no longer hear these column
and row headers spoken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s now say there is a second table on this worksheet
whose top left corner is in cell A15 and bottom right corner is in cell G23. To
use the Define name feature to read this table’s column and row headers, repeat
the above steps, substituting A15 as the start point in step 1, and cell G23 as
the bottom left cell coordinate in step 3.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, the same name cannot be repeated in a single file.
If you are working with multiple sheets, you cannot use the word “title” on
more than one of these sheets. If you attempt to do this, you will hear the
following error message: “This name already exists. Names should be unique.” To
get around this, instead type in “title1, title2, etc.” without the quotes or
any spaces. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In conclusion, the Define names feature is a great tool for
making Excel sheets more readable. Use it whenever you create tables yourself,
as well as when you receive a file from somebody else. The only piece of bad
news is that they don’t always work for files you get from sighted people. This
is because sighted folks sometimes insert lots of blank columns and rows to
visually separate data categories. This makes it hard or impossible to find a
cell at the top left corner that forms the intersection of the column and row
headers you want to designate as titles. QuickBooks, a popular financial
management application, generates balance sheets, profit and loss statements,
and other standard accounting reports in Excel format that have this problem. </p>

<h3>5.2.3 Data Entry and Copying Formulas</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now it’s time to add some values in the body of the table.
Beginning in cell B3, and going down to cell B10, type in numbers for each of
the January expense types. Just type in numbers. Don’t worry about expressing
them in dollars. That will come later. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remember that after typing in a number, you can either press
Enter or the Down arrow key to go to the cell below. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When finished, make sure your cursor focus is on cell B11,
just one cell to the right of where you typed the word “Total.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In cell B11, we will sum the January column. When you are
new to Excel, it can be a bit challenging to enter formulas. You should type
slowly because you may not be accustomed to using several keys (left and right
parentheses, the equal sign, and a few others). Excel is extremely unforgiving
about any typing errors. Also note that there are never any spaces in formulas.
Even if you are a proficient typist, entering formulas can be a painstaking
process. However, the good news is that you won’t have to type too many of
them. As we will see below, for the current table, you will only need to type
in two of them. All the remaining formulas will be copied and pasted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, be sure you know the addresses of the first and last
cells of the data range you want to sum. Here the first cell is B3 and the last
one is B10. In cell B11, type:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>=sum(B3:B10)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can now copy the formula and paste it across row 11 to
sum the columns for the other months, and the final total column. When copying
and pasting files, folders or text, the order of operations is select, copy and
paste. When copying formulas in Excel, the order is slightly different. First,
you copy the formula. Second, you select a range of cells. And third, you paste
the formula to those cells. Therefore, do the following.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In cell B11, press Control C to copy the formula. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow to C11.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press and hold down the Shift key and Right arrow to N11, the bottom
cell of the last column in the table.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control V to paste the formula. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This works because Excel automatically adjusts the formula’s
cell coordinates correctly as you paste across the row. For example, Right
arrow a couple of times to cell D11 which is the formula for summing the March
column. Press F2, the keystroke for editing individual cells, and press the Up
or Down arrow key to read the formula. It should say:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>=sum(D3:D10)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After pressing F2, you can also use the Left and Right arrows
to read individual characters within the cell. When finished, press Escape to
exit the cell edit mode. More on F2 later in this chapter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can follow a similar process to sum a row and then copy
and paste formulas down the relevant column. Once again, be sure you know the
addresses of the first and last cells of the data range you want to sum. This
time, we will start by summing the first bill category row (water), inputting
the formula in cell N3. The first cell is B3 and the last one is M3. In cell
N3, type:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>=sum(B3:M3)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now do the following to copy the formula in cell N3 and
paste it down column N to sum each bill category row for the year:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In cell N3, press Control C to copy the formula. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to cell N4.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press and hold down the Shift key and Down arrow to N11, on the last row
of the table.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control V to paste the formula. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you are constructing a simple rectangular table like
this one, and want to total all the rows and columns, it is this quick and
easy. And you can do this early or later in the process of putting the table
together. As data is inputted in the body of the table for each bill, the
totals in the bottom row and furthest right column will automatically be
recalculated. </p>

<h3>5.2.4 Number Formatting In Cells </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are various ways that simple number formatting can be
converted to other formats such as currency, percentages dates and time. We
will use the Smith budget table as an example and format its numbers as dollars
with two decimals. Initially, we will only do this for cell B3 – the top left
cell of the data range containing numbers. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With cursor focus on cell B3, press the Applications key, Up arrow to
Format cells, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This opens a multi-page dialog box where you land on the Numbers tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Categories combo box, and Down arrow to Currency.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='page-break-after:avoid'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tab once to the
Decimal place Edit spin box whose default setting is two decimals. If you
wanted to change this to zero, you would type this in. While in theory, you can
arrow to zero, I have found that this works poorly, so it is better to type it
in if you wished to change the number of decimals. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Symbol combo box to select the type of currency. While
there are more than 500 symbols to choose from, you land on dollars most of the
time. If you land elsewhere in this combo box, press the Home key to get to the
top of the list and Down arrow to Dollars which is second in the list. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Negative numbers list box which has four options: preceded by
a minus sign; displayed as red; surrounded by parentheses; or both displayed as
red and surrounded by parentheses. Sticking with the default (preceded by a
minus sign) is best for accessibility. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter to make changes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Obviously, you would not want to make this change one cell
at a time, but for multiple cells. Here are two alternatives. One way is to
select the data range of cells for which you want to change the number
formatting. For this spreadsheet, the top left cell of the data range with
numbers is cell B3, and the bottom right one is cell N3. Here’s a super quick
way to change the number formatting of this data range to dollars with two
decimals:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor in cell B3, press Shift Control and End together. This
will select all cells from B3 to N11, as well as all cells within this
rectangular block.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift 4 on the number row to change the cell format to
dollars with two decimals. This is a convenient shortcut key that I use all the
time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even faster, if all the cells with number values in the
sheet are to be converted to dollars with two decimals, and are all contained
in a single data region starting in cell A1, you can simply press Control A to
select all cells from A1 to the bottom right cell in that data region. Then
press Control Shift 4 to convert to dollars with two decimals. This will not
affect the formatting of cells in this data range which currently contain words
rather than numbers. If you later insert numbers in currently empty cells in
this data range, they will appear as dollars with two decimals. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are twelve number format categories listed in the
Category combo box of this dialog. Other than Currency which I already covered,
the most commonly used ones and options for changing their formatting are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Numbers: decimal places, adding comma separators between
thousands, and negative number formatting.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Date: numerous options for displaying month, day, and year.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Time: numerous options for displaying hour, minute, second, and
A.M. or P.M.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Percentage:
number of decimal places.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Special: Use this for columns containing ZIP codes to make them read
properly. If you do not, the ZIP code will read like any other five-digit
number (for example, “forty-four thousand three-hundred and thirty two”) rather
than as individual numbers. Also,  for any ZIP code beginning with zero, the
zero will disappear from the cell. For example, my ZIP code is 02072. Without this
special formatting, only 2072 would appear in the cell, even though I typed a zero
at the beginning. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Below is a summary of shortcut keys that can help you out:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control 1: Open Cell format dialog. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control semi-colon: Format cells with todays date in MM/DD/YYYY
format. </p>

<h3>5.2.5 Merging and Centering Cells</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>We now come to what I consider to be the last step in
creating a simple data table in Excel. Centering the name of the table just
above its top row is something you may wish to do if you are planning to share
the file with sighted users. This involves merging cells, that is, converting
two or more cells into a single one. To merge and center the name of this
table, do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Go to cell A1 where the name of the table (“Monthly Expenses
for the Smith Family for the Year,”) appears. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Hold down the Shift key and Right arrow to cell N1, the rightmost column
of this table. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt H M to open the Merge submenu. You land on the Merge and
center button. Press Enter on this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your screen reader will now say “merged cells A1 through
N1.” If you press Insert F to hear about cell formatting, among other things,
you will hear that its contents are horizontally centered. And if you Right
arrow once, your cursor will land on cell O1 because cell A1 now extends to
column N. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The three other options in the Merge submenu are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Merge across: Merge cells horizontally with left-aligned content.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Merge: Merge cells vertically. Cell content will be vertically
aligned along the bottom of the cell. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Unmerge: Undo merging of previously merged cells. </p>

<h2>5.3 Editing Basics</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Basic editing actions include selecting cells, data ranges,
entire rows, columns, and sheets, as well as deleting, copying, moving and
pasting them. Selecting, copying and pasting formulas were covered above in
Chapter 5.2.3 and will not be repeated here. </p>

<h3>5.3.1 Editing Individual Cells </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To edit data within individual cells, press F2. When you
press the Up or Down arrow key, your screen reader will say the entire cell
contents. This is especially useful for reading formulas. After pressing F2,
you can also use the Left and Right arrows to read individual characters within
the cell, as well as use standard text editing keystrokes to delete or insert
characters. Note that when you press F2, focus is placed on the right side of
the cell. If you wish to keep changes after editing the cell content, press
Enter. If you don’t want to keep changes, or you just want to get out of the
cell, press the Escape key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Often the quickest way to change cell content is to simply
type over existing content and then press Enter, Tab, or arrow away from it. It
is not necessary to select cell content before replacing it. </p>

<h3>5.3.2 Selecting and Editing Data Ranges</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similar to selecting text in other applications, like Word,
several selection keystrokes involve combining the Shift key with navigation
keystrokes. Below are a number of them. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>To select a single cell, simply place your cursor focus on it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>To select an entire row, press Shift Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>To select an entire column, press Control Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>To select multiple contiguous cells across a row one by one from
left to right, hold down the Shift key and press the Right arrow repeatedly
until you get to the end of the selection. Note that the Shift key must be held
down from start to finish.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>To select multiple contiguous cells down a column one by one,
hold down the Shift key and press the Down arrow repeatedly until you get to
the end of the selection. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>To select a rectangular block of cells. Starting with focus on
the top left cell of the rectangular data range, press Shift Right arrow to
select across a row, and Shift Down arrow down the right-most column to the
cell at the bottom right of the data range. As you arrow along, your screen
reader will read the content and address of the first and last cell in the data
range you are selecting. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>To execute zthe above three operations with fewer keystrokes:
hold down the Shift Control and Right arrow keys to select across a row from
the leftmost cell to the rightmost cell; hold down the Shift Control and Down
arrow keys to select down a column from the top-most cell to the bottom-most
cell; and use these two keystrokes to select from the top left corner cell to
the bottom right cell in a rectangular data range. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control A selects an entire data region, that is, a block of
contiguous cells containing data.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that, in making any of the above data range selections
involving the Shift key, you must hold down the Shift key throughout the
process. If you lift it in mid-process and continue arrowing, the
previously-selected cells will become unselected and you will need to start
over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After making any of the selections above, you can:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Copy the cells to the Clipboard with Control C.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Cut the cells to the Clipboard with Control X.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Paste the cells from the Clipboard with Control V.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Delete the cells with the Delete key. </p>

<h3>5.3.3 Inserting and Deleting Rows and Columns</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can insert and delete rows and columns via the
Applications key. Here you can Down arrow to find the Insert and Delete
commands. You can also use ribbon shortcut key combinations which are far more
efficient. If you are going to work much with Excel, it is worth memorizing the
shortcut keys. The ribbon shortcut key combinations all begin with Alt H
because they are located in the Home tab of the ribbons. They are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt H I R: Insert row.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt H I C: Insert column.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt H D R: Delete row.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt H D C: Delete column.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remember that for ribbon keystroke combinations, press the
keys one at a time. Do not try to hold them down together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Returning to the Smith Family Budget table, let’s say we
want to insert a new row in the middle of the table. If your cursor is anywhere
in row 5 and you press Alt H I R, row 5 will now become blank. That row’s
previous content and everything below it will be moved down one row. If your
cursor is anywhere in column B and you press Alt H I C, column B will now
become blank. That column’s previous content and everything to its right will
be moved one column to the right. Pressing Alt H D R will remove a row and move
all rows below it up one row. Pressing Alt H D C will remove a column and move
all columns to its right back one to the left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To insert or delete multiple rows below where your cursor is
currently positioned, press Shift Down arrow to select as many rows as you
want, and then press Alt H I R or Alt H D R. If instead, you want to insert or
delete rows above your current cursor position, you can press Shift Up arrow and
then the same shortcut keys. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To insert or delete multiple columns to the right of your
cursor, first press Shift Right arrow to select them, and then press Alt H I C
or Alt H D C. You can press Shift Left arrow if you want to select multiple
columns to the left and then insert or delete them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have already put formulas for totaling rows or
columns in your table, when you insert or delete rows and columns in the middle
of your table, these formulas will automatically adjust correctly. For example,
if I insert a new blank row 5, and the previous formula summing column B was:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>=sum(B3:B10)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It will move down one row and become:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>=sum(B3:B11)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But be careful. If you insert a new blank row just above the
row with the sum formula, the formula will not automatically adjust. You will
need to change it manually. This behavior is the same when you insert columns. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have one or more formulas in existing rows and then
you insert new rows, it is often a good idea to copy and paste one of the
existing rows in to the new blank one. Then just change whatever you need to
change in the new row while retaining the copied formulas. This is easy to do,
saves time, and avoids mistakes. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt H I R in a cell where you want to insert a new blank row.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow to a cell in one of the other rows already containing
data and formulas. Press Shift Spacebar to select the entire row.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Arrow back to the blank row and paste it with Control V.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Edit the new row data as needed without changing the copied formulas. </p>

<h2>5.4 Sorting Data</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sorting data is quick and easy in Excel. You can sort
columns alphabetically, numerically and by date. I will start with sorting
alphabetically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are maintaining a list of contacts, you will often
want to sort alphabetically by last name. Keep this in mind when first
preparing your data table. Either input last names first, as in “Smith, John,”
or create separate first and last name columns. If you input names in a single
column and begin with first names, you will not be able to sort the data by
last name. Assuming you have created a last name column, steps for sorting
alphabetically are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the last name column, place your cursor on any of the cells
containing a last name. Do not place it on the “last name” column header.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to the Sort submenu, and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You first land on A to Z. Down arrow to see the two other choices, which
are Z to A, and by color. Avoid sorting by color because it is generally
inaccessible.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on A to Z and the column and its associated row data will
now be sorted alphabetically with last names beginning with A at the top of the
column.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To speed up this process, you can first press the
Applications key and then press the letter O to get right into the Sort
submenu.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If there are any blank cells in this column, their
associated row data will be moved to the bottom of the table. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To sort numeric column data, steps are pretty much
identical. The only difference is that when you open the Sort submenu, choices
are Smallest to largest and Largest to smallest. If, for example, you had a
column with rankings (1 as best and 50 as worst), it would make sense to sort
smallest to largest. In the Smith family budget table, you might want to sort
the Annual total column largest to smallest so that the highest cost items
appeared at the top of the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If there are any blank cells or text data in this column,
their associated row data will be moved to the bottom of the table. For
example, if you inputted “not available” in several cells in this column, all
associated row data would be moved to the bottom after sorting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To sort by date, here too, steps are identical, the only
difference being that choices are oldest to newest and newest to oldest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As above, for any blank cells or text data in this column,
their associated row data will be moved to the bottom of the table. Because of
the way dates are coded in Excel, sorting by date only works for data after the
year 1900. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When sorting column data, there are a couple of potential
complications to guard against. When sorting alphabetically, it is possible
that the row containing column headers could find its way into the middle of
the table. For example, if row 2 contained column headers and you sorted by the
Last name column, this row’s data could wind up in the middle of the table with
the L in Last name causing it to move there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the last row contains formulas for summing the columns
and you then sort numerically, this last row will be moved to the top of the
table, just below the row containing the column headers. This would happen with
The Smith family budget table. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inserting a blank row between the column headers row and the
first row with data will avoid the first problem. If the column headers are
contained in row 2 and the actual data begins in row 3, with your focus
somewhere on row 3, press Alt H I R, making row 3 blank and shifting all the
data rows down one row. Sorting alphabetically will now work correctly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To correct the second problem, insert a blank row between
the bottom row where any sum formulas are located, and the data row just above
it. Sorting numerically will now work. </p>

<h2>5.5 Multiple Worksheets</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>So far, all our work has involved a single worksheet.
However, you can have multiple worksheets in a single file. With large datasets
and multiple tables, it quickly gets unwieldy to place them all on a single
worksheet. Printing them in hard copy can also be a nightmare. If you have
detailed company sales data for a year and want to present it on a monthly
basis, it probably makes more sense to create twelve worksheets rather than put
all twelve tables on a single worksheet. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To navigate an Excel file with multiple worksheets, press
Control Page down to go to the next worksheet and Control Page up to go to the
previous worksheet. This is a Windows keystroke so works with all three screen
readers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS, you can get a list of worksheets by pressing Control
Shift S (think of S for “sheets”). You can then Down arrow or first-letter
navigate to a worksheet, and press Enter to open it. This is very useful for
efficiently navigating a file with many worksheets. It is also helpful to see
the order in which the worksheets are presented in case you want to reorder
them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To get a list of worksheets using NVDA, do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert F7 to open the Elements list.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab once and Down arrow to the Sheets radio button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the list of worksheets. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As with JAWS, either Down arrow or first-letter to a worksheet and press
Enter to open it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Getting a list of worksheets is not possible with Narrator. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a number of actions you can perform with multiple
worksheets, including inserting, deleting, renaming, and moving and copying
them. JAWS has a context menu for managing worksheets where you can
conveniently access all these commands. With NVDA and Narrator, you will need
to find each of these commands in the ribbons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To open the Manage worksheets context menu, press Shift
Insert S. I try to remember “SIS” - short for “sister.” In the order in which
they appear as you Down arrow here, The most important commands are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Insert: When you press Enter, the first item is Worksheet. Press
Enter again and a new worksheet will open with focus on cell A1. This worksheet
appears one worksheet before the one where you started this operation.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Delete: When you press Enter, you will be asked to confirm if you
want to delete the current worksheet. Press the Spacebar on the Yes button if
this is your intention.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Rename: Generic worksheet names are Sheet 1, Sheet 2, etc. You
should rename them if you plan on creating more than just a few worksheets.
Otherwise, you will quickly lose track of which one is which. Press Enter here,
type in a short name and press Enter again. If you then press Insert T, your
screen reader will read the filename, followed by “Excel,” and the worksheet
name at the end. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Move or copy: In this dialog, you first land on Move. After you
have created a series of worksheets, use the Move command to reorder them. When
you Down arrow to a worksheet in the list, pressing enter will insert the
current worksheet just before it. The bottom item on the list is “Move to end.”
Press Enter here if you want to place the current worksheet last. If instead
you want to create a copy of the current worksheet, Tab once to the Copy
checkbox and press the Spacebar. Then Tab one more time to the OK button and
press the Spacebar. The copy will have the same name as the original worksheet,
followed by the number two in parentheses.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Select all sheets: Use this command if you want to copy multiple
worksheets to a different file. This avoids having to copy them one at a time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Ribbon shortcut keys for the above commands that you can use
with NVDA and Narrator are: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Shift F11: Insert new worksheet.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt H O R: Rename worksheet.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt H O M: Move or copy worksheet.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt H D S: Delete worksheet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Paste link command allows you to copy and paste a
formula from one worksheet to another. For example, let’s say you have monthly
profit data on twelve separate worksheets. You can insert a summary worksheet
with links to the total monthly profits formula in each of the monthly
worksheets. If you make changes in any monthly worksheet that results in the
total profit for that month changing, the change in the monthly total profit
formula will be fed through to the summary worksheet. Continuing with this example,
to paste a link from one worksheet to another, do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor on the cell in the monthly worksheet containing the
total profits formula for that month, and press Control C to copy it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the summary worksheet and place focus on the cell where you
want to paste the formula. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key and Down arrow to Paste options, but do not
press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Instead, Left arrow once to the Paste link button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The syntax of this formula contains: the equal sign, the
worksheet name from which the formula is being copied surrounded by
apostrophes, the exclamation sign, and the address of the cell being copied.
For example, if the total profits formula was contained in cell E26 of the
February worksheet, the Paste links formula in the summary worksheet would be:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>=’February’!$E$26</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider creating a summary worksheet for a file containing
a large number of worksheets, and use the Paste links command to present data
on this worksheet. It is a more convenient and effective way to communicate the
most important data to colleagues, versus having these data scattered across a
large number of worksheets. </p>

<h2>5.6 Filtering</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Filtering allows you to temporarily hide some data in a
dataset so you can zero in on those data that you want to examine more closely.
This is especially useful for working with large datasets. Let’s say that you
are the Eastern Massachusetts regional manager of a retail chain that operates
throughout New England. The database you are working with contains 20,000
records with information on each store, employee, and transaction over the last
year. If your goal is to focus on just the stores in the Boston area, filtering
would allow you to temporarily narrow the visible data. Instead of having to
wade through 20,000 records, most of which are not relevant, filtering would
allow you to reduce the dataset to a more workable number of transactions. If
you are only interested in analyzing data for the last three months, you could
further narrow down the dataset using filtering. And if you want to focus on
just a few products or employees, you could perform additional filtering. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will demonstrate using an example with far fewer entries. <span
style='color:black;background:white'>In this section and the next one on pivot
tables, I will reference the file that accompanies this book entitled “</span>Quarterly
Sales By Employee.xlsx.<span style='color:black;background:white'>” You may
wish to open it to follow along and repeat the steps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>This worksheet
contains quarterly sales data for employees in five electronics stores in the
Boston area. Column headers in this workbook go across row 2 and include: </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Employee (column B): The first names of three employees in each

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Quarter (column C): Quarters one through four of a particular
year.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Product (column D): Three products sold in each of the stores,
including iPhone SE, Samsung TV, and HP laptops.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Quantity (column E): The number of each of these products sold by
employee in a particular quarter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Price (column F): The unit price in dollars for each of the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Sales (column G): The formula for price times quantity expressed
in dollars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As an example, we will filter to narrow focus to just the
Cambridge and Newton stores for the first quarter, and iPhone SE sales. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To turn on filtering, your cursor must be somewhere on the
row containing the column headers (in this case, row 2). In addition, there can
not be any blank rows between this row and the data rows. So, here goes:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor on the column headers row (in this example, row 2),
press Control Shift L. If you now Left or Right arrow, JAWS and Narrator say
“No filter applied auto filter drop-down.” NVDA does not say anything. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor on the cell containing the column header you first
want to filter. We will start in cell A2 where the column header “Store”
appears. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

filtering by. In this case, these are the five stores identified above. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>When finished checking or unchecking items, Tab once to the OK button and
press Enter. Be sure to Tab only once. You can easily Tab past it because you
first hear “type words to search for” before hearing “OK button.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow in this column. You will notice two things: only the rows
with the stores you left checked will appear. The unchecked rows are hidden. In
this case Rows A3 to A38 and A75 to A146 are skipped over as you Down arrow.
Also, as you Down arrow, your screen reader will say “adjacent to hidden
cells,” at the boundary between the hidden and unhidden rows. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To further filter by quarter, go to cell C2 where the column header
“Quarter” appears. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat steps three and four above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This time, press the Spacebar to uncheck the Select all
checkbox. Down arrow to the first Quarter and check this checkbox. All other
quarters you want hidden are already unchecked.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat steps three and four above. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Tab once to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you have filtered to focus in on the data you want to
analyze, you can select the entire worksheet by pressing Control A, and then
copying and pasting the data into a new worksheet. Only the unhidden rows will
be pasted into the new worksheet. Extracting the data this way from a larger
dataset is preferable to attempting to continue working with it in the initial
worksheet, especially if the dataset is large. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the above example, for some columns, I left the Select
all checkbox checked and for others I unchecked it. If there are only a few
items in the list, the decision to check or uncheck the Select all checkbox is
fairly trivial. However, if the number of items listed is large. This is no
longer a trivial decision. For example I once had a client who wanted to filter
a column of vendors from whom his state agency had procured goods and services.
There were over 700 vendors listed, and he was interested in displaying the
data for just three vendors. It was important that he unchecked the Select all
checkbox. After doing that, he was also able to first-letter navigate to
quickly find the checkboxes for his three vendors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you are finished filtering in the initial worksheet,
from anywhere in that worksheet, you can press Control Shift L again, and all
the hidden rows will reappear.</p>

<h2>5.7 Pivot Tables</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>Pivot tables are
useful for reorganizing relevant data fields into tables so you can zero in on
the information you are interested in analyzing. They are called “pivot
tables&quot; because, from a visual perspective, dragging and dropping selected
data columns from an initial data table “pivots” these into a new table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>I have used pivot
tables for organizing conferences. I needed to track how many people had
registered, how much they had paid, add up voluntary donations to the
organization, their lunch choice, whether they preferred receiving the agenda
electronically, in Braille, or large print, and several other things. I also
used pivot tables to present results of a survey with ten or fifteen questions
about the accessibility of voting machines. Without resorting to pivot tables,
figuring out how to organize and report results would have been messier, much
more time-consuming, and prone to computational error. An added bonus to using
pivot tables is that, after initial construction, they are quick and easy to
update as you add new data. In the conference example mentioned above, I was
able to regularly update and report figures as new registration information
came in prior to the conference. </span></p>

<h3><span style='color:black;background:white'>5.7.1 Creating Pivot Tables</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>A generic table
consists of up to three parts. Using the simple example of the Monthly Expenses
table from earlier in this chapter, and using pivot table nomenclature, these
are:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Row labels down the
leftmost column where the different bill types are listed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Column labels along
the top row of the table. In this case, the months of the year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Values, the actual
data in the table, in this case, the dollar amounts of each bill. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>These are the building
blocks for constructing pivot tables. Pivot tables can have row labels and
values, column labels and values, or both row and column labels and values. All
must have values, and values must be numeric (quantities, dollars, percentages,
etc.).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>In this section,
I will reference the quarterly sales by employee worksheet used in the previous
section on filtering. </span>I will construct several pivot tables from these
data. The first one will be total sales by quarter for each of the stores. This
will involve designating Store names as row labels, quarters as column labels,
and sales amounts as values. <span style='color:black;background:white'>Steps
for creating this pivot table are:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Select the data range that
includes the column header row and the data. In this workbook, the data range
is A2 through G182. With your cursor focus on cell A2, a quick way to select
this data range is to press Shift Control End. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Press Alt to open the Upper
ribbon, Right arrow once to the Insert tab, tab once into the Lower ribbon, and
press Enter on the Pivot table button (the shortcut key is Alt N V).</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>You land in a dialog box
where the selected data range is indicated. Assuming the data range is correct,
press Enter here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>You now land on cell A3 in a
new blank worksheet. Do not navigate away from this cell. Otherwise, the next
step will not work. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Press F6 a couple of times
until you hear “pivot table fields, find words to search for.” </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Tab once where you will find
all your column headers listed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Down arrow to the first of
these that you want to be part of your pivot table, either as a row label,
column label, or value. In this case, you first land on “store,” which is the
variable we want to use as a row label. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Press the Applications key, Down

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Down arrow to the next column
header in the list that you want to be either a column label or value. In this
case, it is “Quarter,” which will be the column label.</span></p>

style='color:black;background:white'>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to
Add to values, and press Enter. You are returned to the list of column headers,

<p class=MsoListParagraph>13.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span><span
style='color:black;background:white'>The pivot table is now ready to view.
Press F6 four times until you have returned to the worksheet. You will know
when you are there because you land in cell A3 every time. In this case, you
hear “Sum of sales A3.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>Note that the
order in which you add row labels, column labels and values does not matter.
Simply add them in the order they appear as you Down arrow through the list. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>The table appears
as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>The five stores are

</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>The grand total for
all stores and all quarters appears in the bottom right cell. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>Note that the
values only appear as simple numbers. Press Control A to select the entire
table, and press Control Shift 4 to quickly change their format to dollars with
two decimal places. Also note that you should rename the worksheet using the
steps outlined in Chapter 5.5 so you don’t confuse it with other pivot tables
you will be creating on other sheets. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>I frequently
create pivot tables whose purpose is simply to count things. I mentioned above
that I used pivot tables for planning a conference. I created pivot tables to
count up the number of lunch choices, preferred agenda format (email Braille,
large print), and a few more items. For these tables, I designated lunch choice
and preferred agenda format as row labels. To add values, I inserted a column
called “Quantity,” that I filled with the number 1 for all the entries. </span></p>

<h3><span style='color:black;background:white'>5.7.2 Filtering Pivot Table Data</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>You can filter
pivot tables to narrow your focus. Using the table we have just constructed,
let’s say we are only interested in sales of the Boston store in the first
quarter. We can filter this table as follows:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Navigate to cell A4 which
contains the text “row labels,” and press Alt Down arrow to open the Filter
dialog. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Shift Tab to the tree view
where you land on the Select all checkbox which is checked. Press the Spacebar
to uncheck it, thus unchecking all the store names underneath it in the list. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Down arrow to the Boston
checkbox and press the Spacebar to check it. If you wanted to include other
stores, you would Down arrow to them and check them too. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Tab once to the OK button and
press Enter. The other store rows are now hidden. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>To filter the quarters,
navigate to cell B3 which contains the text “Column labels,” and Down arrow to
open the Filter dialog.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Shift Tab to the tree view
where you land on the Select all checkbox which is checked. Press the Spacebar
to uncheck it, thus unchecking all the quarters underneath it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Down arrow to the first
quarter checkbox and press the Spacebar to check it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Tab once to the OK button and
press Enter. The other quarter columns are now hidden and only the Boston first
quarter sales values appear. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>A wide variety of
pivot tables can be constructed with a dataset such as that contained in the
original worksheet. These might include:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Total sales by
employee</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Total sales by
product.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Product sales by
store. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Product sales by
quarter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>These could be
filtered to narrow in on subsets of products, employees, quarters, or stores. </span></p>

<h3><span style='color:black;background:white'>5.7.3 Refreshing Pivot Tables</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>Once you have
created a set of pivot tables, it is quick and easy to update them as new data
is inserted in the initial data table, and as long as you use the following
trick. If you want to insert new rows, insert them somewhere in the middle of
the table rather than under the bottom row. Similarly, insert new columns
between existing columns, rather than after the last one. The data range
captured for recalculating the pivot tables will automatically adjust. Once you
have inserted the new data:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Navigate to any of the sheets
containing a previously-created pivot table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Place your cursor on any cell
with data in it. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Press the Applications key, Down
arrow to Refresh, and press Enter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>All pivot tables
are now updated with the new data incorporated in the calculations. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>By contrast, if
you add new rows below or new columns to the right of the existing ones,
refreshing is more time-consuming. If at all possible, avoid doing this because
you will need to repeat the steps below for each pivot table that you want to
refresh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>Let’s say I have
added data for a sixth store. The previous data range was A2 through G182, and
now has been extended to G219. Also let’s say the name of the sheet is “data.”
Steps for refreshing an individual pivot table are:</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Navigate to the sheet
containing one of the pivot tables you wish to update and place your cursor
somewhere in this table.</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Press the Alt key to open the
Upper ribbon, and Right arrow to the Pivot table analyze tab. Note that this
tab only appears when your cursor is situated in a pivot table. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Tab into the Lower ribbon to
the Change data source split button and press Enter. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>You land in an edit field
where you type in the sheet with the raw data and the data range. The syntax
is: the name of the sheet followed by the exclamation mark and then the new
data range. In this case, type “data!a2:g219”without the quotes. </span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='color:black;background:white'>Tab to the OK button and
press Enter. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>This pivot table
is now refreshed with calculations incorporating the new data. Unfortunately,
you will need to repeat these steps for all previously-created pivot tables
that you wish to refresh. In light of this, it is preferable to insert the rows
for the sixth store somewhere in the middle of the data table rather than below
the bottom row. </span></p>

<h2>5.8 Visual Considerations and Printing Worksheets</h2>

<h3>5.8.1 Adjusting Column Width</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>You can manually
adjust column width or automatically resize&nbsp;<b><span style='border:none windowtext 1.0pt;
padding:0in'>columns</span></b> to fit the data. The automatic option is called
“autofit.” If you are sharing spreadsheets with sighted people, it is important
to know if your column widths are correct. Otherwise, they may be unable to see
data in some of the cells. JAWS calls this issue “cell text visibility,” and I
will use this term here. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>If a column is
not wide enough to accommodate the content of a particular cell, and the cell
to its right also contains content, what you hear using a screen reader program
and what visual users see is different. And this also differs between cell
content that is text or numbers. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>With respect to
cell content that is text, screen reader programs will read all cell content,
regardless of whether the column in which it is contained is wide enough, and
even if there is content in the cell to its right. If there is content in the
cell to the right, sighted users will only see the text that fits within the
current column width. If a sighted user places focus on a particular cell, that
cell’s full text becomes visible in the Formula bar, a </span>long thin
rectangle near the top of the screen and under the ribbons. The Formula bar
extends to the right edge of the screen. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>If a cell text
visibility problem exists, NVDA indicates this by default. The JAWS default is
to not indicate it, but a setting can be changed for individual sheets.
Narrator does not currently have a way to identify cell text visibility
problems.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>For JAWS, turning
on the setting to detect cell text visibility problems is done in Quick
Settings. See Chapter </span>8.1.4.1 <span style='color:black;background:white'>on
how to do this. Unfortunately, it can only be changed for one file at a time,
and cannot be switched to become the default setting. In addition, I have found
that JAWS does not reliably indicate when there is no longer a cell text
visibility problem. In my opinion, this is one area where NVDA does a better
job than JAWS. NVDA identifies this problem without having to change a setting,
and is also more reliable in telling you when you have fixed it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>If a column is
not wide enough for the text content in cell A7, and there is content in cell
B7 to its right, JAWS and NVDA will identify this as a cropped cell. NVDA will
say “cropped at A7.” If cell text visibility detection is turned on, JAWS will
say “cropped right at B7.” If there is no content in cell B7, NVDA will say
“overflows A7.” JAWS will say “overlaps near B7,” or whichever cell the text
extends to on that row. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>With respect to
numeric data with cell text visibility problems, what your screen reader says
and what sighted users see may differ depending on software versions. With my
current versions of JAWS, NVDA, and Excel, data are expressed using scientific
notation. For example, the number five billion is expressed as “5E+09.” Sighted
users may instead see the cell filled with the symbol for numbers. Narrator
users hear the full number even though it is not visible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>Commands for
changing column width are located in the Cells group of the Home tab but are
hard to find. Instead use the shortcut keys, which are Alt H O W for adjusting
manually and Alt H O I for autofit. While it is usually better to autofit
rather than guess at a manual width, the manual command allows you to detect
the current column width. However, its meaning is not immediately clear. Press
Alt H O W, and you will hear something like 8.11. </span><span
style='line-height:107%;color:black'>The default column width is specified as a
number of characters. So this means that 8.11 characters in the current font
can fit within the width of the column. Back in typewriter days, individual
character size was fixed so that either 10 or 12 characters fit within one
inch. Nowadays, fonts are proportional, meaning that letters like M take up
more room than letters like I. Thus, expressing column width this way is of
limited value. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Changing workbook views allows column width to be expressed
in inches. Steps for doing this for an individual file are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, and Right arrow to the View tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon to the Workbook submenu and press Enter. You
land on the Normal view which is checked by default.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Page layout view and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt H O W, and column width should now be expressed in inches. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This setting will be retained when you save the file. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can change the default view to the Page layout view as
follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F T to open Excel options, where you land on the General
category.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Default view for new sheets combo box, and Down arrow to Page
layout. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So finally, after all this, how do you go about changing
column width? To change it manually, press Alt H O W, type in a new column
width value, and press Enter. If you have changed to Page layout view, express
the value in inches. It is not necessary to type the quotation mark for inches.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To autofit a column:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Spacebar to select the column.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt H O I to autofit.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you want to find out what the new column width is, press Alt H O W to
see it, and then the Escape key when you are done. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>You could also
select multiple columns by pressing Shift Right arrow several times across a
row, then Control Spacebar to select the columns, and then you could either
change column width manually or autofit them, as outlined above. However, with
regard to autofitting this way, keep in mind that a table with lots of different
column widths is unsightly. It is more appropriate to have a wider column where
the row headers are located (Usually column A), and uniform widths for the
remaining columns to the right.</span></p>

<h3>5.8.2 Text Wrapping</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can wrap text so that it appears on multiple lines in a
cell. You can format the cell so the text wraps automatically, or you can
insert a manual line break. To wrap text automatically, select the cell or
cells that you want to wrap, and press Alt H W. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Data in the cell wraps to fit the column width, so if you
change the column width, data wrapping adjusts automatically to shift text
between lines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can manually insert a line break within an individual
cell. To do this, navigate to the position in the cell where you want to add
the line break, and press Alt Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In cells with wrapped text, JAWS indicates this by saying
“multiline cell.” Neither NVDA nor Narrator say anything to indicate the
presence of text wrapping.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If text wraps to add new lines to an individual cell, the
height of the entire row adjusts to accommodate this change. Content in other
cells on this row are vertically aligned to the bottom of the cell. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To hear the height of the current row, press Alt H O H. To
find out how many lines are in the current cell, press F2 and Down arrow to
read line by line. </p>

<h3>5.8.3 Headers and Footers</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Headers and footers can be added to appear at the top and
bottom of printed pages, respectively. Information commonly inserted in headers
and footers include file and worksheet names, date and time the file was last
revised, and page numbers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are quite a few built-in options that can be inserted.
To insert a header or footer:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Insert tab, press Control Right arrow to move to the Text group,
and press Enter to open the Text submenu. Tab to the Header and footer button
and press Enter. The shortcut key is Alt N H 1.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You first land in the Center section of a blank Header pane. Press Tab
and Shift Tab to move between the left, center, and right sections of this
pane. You can also press Page down and Page up to toggle between the header and
Footer panes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in either the Header or Footer pane, press Alt to open the
context-specific Header and footer tab. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon where you will find an array of built-in
fields, including: page number, number of pages, current date, current time,
file path, file name, and sheet name. There are also a Header submenu and
Footer submenu with additional built-in options you can select. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Escape key when finished adding your built-in choices. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS, you can press Insert F1 for Screen-sensitive help
to detect the presence of headers or footers. If, for example, there were a
header containing the filename, JAWS would say “header:,” followed by the
filename. With NVDA and Narrator, you will need to use the header or footer
Edit command to see what appears in the Header or Footer panes. The shortcut
keys to quickly get there are Alt N H E for the Header pane, and Alt N O E for
the Footer pane. Once you are there, Tab to hear what appears in the left,
center and right areas of the pane </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To remove a header or footer, the shortcut keys are Alt N H
R and Alt N O R, respectively. I find that if I need to edit a header or
footer, it is easier to remove the existing one and start over, rather than try
to edit it. </p>

<h3>5.8.4 Formatting Tables</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you intend to share your worksheets with sighted people,
you can make them more visually appealing by using table styles which adds a
number of visual elements, including bolding column and row headers, and
varying background shading of alternating columns or rows. You can also add
borders around entire tables, selected rows, columns or cells to make them
stand out. If you have never done this before, ask experienced sighted Excel
users about appropriate table formatting choices. </p>

<h4>5.8.4.1 Table Styles</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is easy to select a table style, but understanding the
pattern of the table styles is not readily apparent without a few workarounds. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To illustrate, I will use the example of a quarterly sales
table of a retail store, where the name of the table “Quarterly Sales of the
Acme Company ” appears in cell A1, its various products are arrayed down column
A, beginning in cell A2 where the column header “Product” is written, and the
various products appear from cells A3 through A9, and the four quarters are
enumerated in cells B2 through B5. The word “Total” appears in cell A10 and
cell F2. Column and row totals will be summed in rows 10 and column F,
respectively. Therefore, the table’s data range begins in A2 at the top left
corner and F10 at the bottom right corner. The table name in cell A1 is not
part of the table. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for selecting a style for this table and then adapting
it to your wishes are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='page-break-after:avoid'><a name="_Hlk69719688">1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Select the
table’s data range, which in this case is A2 through F10. To do this quickly,
with your cursor in cell A2, press Shift Control Right arrow to select across
to cell F2, and while continuing to hold down the Control and Shift keys
together, Down arrow once to cell F10. Your screen reader will say the content
and coordinate of the top left cell and then the content and coordinate of the
bottom right cell.</a></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt H T, which is the ribbon shortcut key to get into the Format
as table submenu. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This opens a table styles gallery. Right arrowing here presents a series
of colors, including white and black/grey, white and blue, white and orange,
white and grey, white and yellow, white and blue (lighter shades than the first
set of blue and white options), and white and green. Down arrowing presents
various shade levels of those colors (light, medium and dark). Arrow to a color
and shade that appeals to you and press Enter to choose it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in a dialog box where the cell range chosen is repeated. Tab
once to the My table has headers checkbox and press the Spacebar if you want
the top row to serve as the column header row. This will bold the column
headers.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This data range is now a formatted table. To get a sense of
the characteristics of the table style you have chosen, beyond just its color
and shading, and with your cursor placed somewhere in this data range:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, and Right arrow to the Table tools
table Design tab. This is a context-specific tab. It will only appear if your
cursor is situated in the table’s data range. The shortcut key to get to it is
Alt J T.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Right arrow to navigate to the Table styles options group
in the Lower ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In this group, Tab through the various options to see which of the
following checkboxes are checked or unchecked: header row, totals row, banded
rows, first column, last column, and banded columns. If banded rows or columns
are checked, this indicates that alternating rows or columns are shaded with
the color selection you made. Check first column if you want to bold it. If
header is checked, that row will be bolded. If totals are checked, a totals row
will be added. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Spacebar on any of these if you wish to check or uncheck them.
Unfortunately, modifying a single one throws you back into the table. You have
to repeat the above steps to get back here and continue modifying them one by
one. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat these steps until you have the desired formatting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that checking the Header row and First column
checkboxes will bold their cell content. In JAWS, they will also be read
similarly to when the Define names command is used to speak column and row
headers as you navigate within the table. However, headers are not consistently
read with NVDA and Narrator. Therefore, to be sure they read properly, you
should still use Excel’s Define name command for reading column and row headers
(see Chapter 5.2.2 above).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To turn off table formatting so that the data range reverts
to its original formatting, do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the data range of the table. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt H E F to clear formatting. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow to the Table submenu, Down arrow to
Convert to range, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You are asked whether you want to convert the table to a normal range.
Press the Spacebar on the Yes button to confirm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you add banded rows or columns, you wan to be sure they
have sufficient color contrast with the cell content. The Excel Accessibility
Checker is a useful tool for doing this. Access it as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt, Right arrow to the Review tab, Tab to the Check accessibility
split button, and Press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Inspection results. If you hear “no accessibility issues found,”
then your table style choice is OK. However, if you hear “warnings,” then Down
arrow through the results, presented in a tree view. This will reveal the
problem, saying “hard to read text contrast,” and naming the sheet where the
problematic table appears. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If this happens, clear the table style, choose another one, and run the Accessibility
Checker again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here are a few hints and caveats about the process of adding
table styles:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When you open the file, if you hear that it is in compatibility
mode, this means that the file was originally saved in the older 1997/2003
Excel file format rather than the newer one beginning with Excel 2007. Turn
this off for more dependable outcomes. Also note that the Accessibility Checker
will not work in compatibility mode. Press Alt F I to get to the Info tab, Tab
to the Compatibility mode convert button and press Enter. You will be asked to
save it, which you should do. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Navigating to the table Design tab on the Upper ribbon requires
pressing the Right arrow quite a few times. If you are going to navigate there
several times to modify format options, use the shortcut key which is Alt J T.
Then press Control Right arrow to more quickly navigate back to the Table
styles options group in the Lower ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Don’t check the Total row checkbox. It gives unreliable results. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If you are going to add shading, select either banded columns or
banded rows for easier readability for sighted readers.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>As of the writing of this book pressing Insert F gives more
dependable information about font color with NVDA and Narrator than with JAWS.
However, none of the screen readers are very dependable for identifying format
information. </p>

<h4>5.8.4.2 Adding Borders</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also format tables by surrounding the entire table,
as well as cells within it, with borders of varying thickness. I should first
clarify the difference <b><span style='color:#202124;background:white'>between
borders and gridlines. </span></b><span style='color:#1E1E1E;background:white'>Borders
of varying thickness may be added to make tables and/or parts of those tables
stand out on the computer screen and on printed pages. </span><b><span
style='color:#202124;background:white'>Gridlines</span></b><span
style='color:#202124;background:white'> are thin horizontal and vertical gray
lines that visually differentiate boundaries between cells on your computer
screen. If you add borders, they will appear on both your computer screen and
printed pages. Gridlines appear on your computer screen but not on </span>printed
pages, unless you change a setting to make them appear when <span
style='color:#202124;background:white'>p</span>rinted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As an example, lets format the table discussed above by
adding thick borders on the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the entire
table, another thick border below the column header row to set it apart from
the other rows, and thin gridlines around the remaining cell edges in the
table. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To add thick borders around the entire table, select the table’s data
range: A2 through F10. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow to Format cells, and press Enter.
This opens a multi-page dialog box. Press Control Tab until you get to the
Borders page. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to a series of radio buttons for adjusting border line
thickness. Down arrow to the Thick radio button. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Outline button and press the Spacebar. Now Tab through and
you should hear that the top, bottom, left and right checkboxes are checked.
Because you initiated this process by selecting the entire table, this choice
will add thick borders around the entire table while leaving gridlines around
all the interior cell edges.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To now add a thick border to the bottom edges of the column header
cells, select the cells in row 2 (cells A2 through F2). </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To get to the Borders dialog more quickly, press the Applications key,
and then F. Your focus should immediately land on the Borders page of the
Format cells multi-page dialog box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once. Your focus should still be on the Thick radio button. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Outline button and press the Spacebar. As you continue
tabbing, you should again hear that the top, bottom, left, and right checkboxes
are checked. The edges around the entire row will be thick, while the interior
vertical edges will remain as gridlines.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Tab
to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>11.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>To
also print the gridlines of the remaining cell edges, press the Alt key, Right
arrow to the Page Layout tab, press Control Right arrow until you get to the
Sheets group. You first land on the View gridlines checkbox. Tab one more time
to the Print gridlines checkbox and press the Spacebar to check it. When I
tabbed to this command on my computer, my screen reader only said “print.” But
when I tabbed past it, and Shift tabbed back to it, it said “gridlines print.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To remove borders:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the desired data range.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, and then F. Your focus should immediately
land on the Borders page of the Format cells multi-page dialog box if you were
there previously. If you land elsewhere, press Control Tab until you get there.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span> Tab to the None button, and press the Spacebar to check it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adding borders correctly may require a fair amount of trial
and error. JAWS has an extremely useful keystroke for revealing the border
pattern of individual cells. After making border changes, spot-check them by
navigating to a few cells and pressing Alt Shift B to check their border
formats. For example, after I made the changes above, when I pressed this
keystroke with my cursor in cell A2, JAWS said “Black thin gridline right edge,
thick black continuous left, bottom and top edge borders of active cell.”
Spot-checking a few other cells in the table confirmed that I had formatted borders
as intended. However, when I tried to mix things up a bit by adding borders of
varying thickness, results were unreliable. Therefore, I would recommend that
if you try to add borders, don’t attempt anything too elaborate. If using JAWS,
continuously check your work with the Alt Shift B keystroke. Unfortunately, I
am unaware of any reliable way to check border formatting with NVDA or
Narrator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, you may wish to bold the cell content of selected
rows or columns, such as column and row headers, or total rows or columns. This
is easy. Simply select the data range, and then press Control B to bold it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A final observation: formatting Excel tables is finicky and
temperamental. Screen reader feedback may be less than reliable. Consequently,
the only way to be absolutely sure that you have formatted your table as
intended is to have a sighted person look it over.</p>

<h3>5.8.5 Printing</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can print individual worksheets, all worksheets for a
multi-sheet file, or a selected data range or print area in a worksheet. To
print a data range in a worksheet rather than the entire worksheet, first
select the block of cells using the keystrokes discussed in Chapter 5.3.2 above.
Steps for printing are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control P to open the Print dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab to the Print what combo box, and Down arrow through the
choices, which are: active sheets, entire workbook, and selection. Press Enter
on your choice. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you are ready to print, press Tab to the Print button and press
Enter. Otherwise, press the Escape key. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If your data selection is too large to fit on a single page,
you need to consider how it will be arranged on multiple pages. Elements to
consider include page size, font size, margin dimensions, and column and row
height. Here are the Excel default settings, and I will use them in this
section:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Page size of 8.5 inches wide by 11 inches high in portrait mode. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Calibri font with 11 point size.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Top and bottom margins of 0.7 inches, and left and right margins
of 0.75 inches.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Column width of 0.7 inches and row height of 0.2 inches.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>No headers or footers, presence of which can effect the number of
rows that fit on a page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Based on this configuration, eight columns and 47 rows of
data can fit on a single page on my computer. I am not prepared to say that
this is universal, but it will work for illustrating what follows in this
section. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a worksheet has more columns and/or rows of data than
will fit on a single page using this configuration, you need to know a few
techniques for printing. JAWS in particular, has some useful tools to aid in
the printing process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s say we have a worksheet that has 15 columns (from
column A to O) and 65 rows. All this data will not fit on a single page. With
JAWS, pressing Control Shift B brings up the Cells and page breaks list. This
identifies where horizontal and vertical page breaks occur. In this case JAWS
identifies the horizontal page break at A48, meaning that row 48 will be the
first row on the second page. Down arrow once and JAWS indicates a vertical
page break at cell K1, meaning that column K will be the first column on the
second page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pressing Insert F1 brings up JAWS Screen-Sensitive Help.
Among other things, JAWS reads the following print-related information: 1
horizontal full page break, 1 vertical full page break, and 4 portrait pages
can be printed from this worksheet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The data ranges and default order of printing will be:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A1 to J47 on page one.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A48 to J 65 on page 2.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>K1 to O 47 on page 3.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>K48 to O 65 on page 4.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you print a data range with horizontal page breaks, you
will want to be sure that column headers appear on every page. Otherwise,
readers will have difficulty interpreting data on page two and beyond.
Likewise, If you print a data range with vertical page breaks, you will want
row headers to appear on every page. And If you print a data range with both
horizontal and vertical page breaks, both column and row headers should appear
on each page. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Alt key to open the Upper ribbon, and Right arrow to the Layout
tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon to the Print titles button and press Enter.
The shortcut key is Alt P I. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Rows to repeat at top. If your print selection will have one or
more horizontal page breaks, type here the row number or numbers of your column
headers. If column headers are in row 2, type in here “2,” minus the quotes. If
column headers are in two rows, say two and three, type “2:3” here, minus the
quotes. The colon indicates rows two through three. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Columns to repeat at left. If your print selection has one or
more vertical page breaks, type here the column letter or letters of your row
headers. This is nearly always just Column A, so type “A” here, minus the
quotes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Grid lines checkbox, and press the Spacebar to check this if
you want narrow grid lines to appear between cells. This is one way to make
table reading clearer for sighted viewers.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='page-break-after:avoid'>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tab to the Down
then over radio button. This indicates the order of how data ranges will be
printed. Leaving it this way results in the print order indicated above. Down
arrow once to the Over then down radio button if you wish to change the page
printing order.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If possible, try to avoid data spilling onto lots of printed
pages. An excessive number of vertical and horizontal page breaks can make it
hard to understand the information if it is carved up into lots of slices. You
should also avoid printing pages with just one or two columns or rows. If you
find yourself in such a situation, there are a few things you can do. First, if
the page is not wide enough to accommodate all your columns, switch from the
default portrait mode to landscape mode by pressing Alt P O, Down arrowing to
the Landscape button, and pressing Enter. Two or three more columns will now
fit on a page, but with about twelve fewer rows. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, you can adjust margin dimensions to make them
narrower, thus allowing more columns to fit on a page. To do this, press Alt P
M, Tab to the Narrow margins button and press Enter. This changes the left and
right margins from the 0.7 inch default to 0.25 inches, thus adding a bit less
than one inch for fitting columns. This may not sound like much, but sometimes
every little bit counts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Third, you can use the Scale to fit feature in the Print
dialog. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control P to open the Print dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Scale to fit combo box and Down arrow through the choices,
which are: no scaling, fit sheet to one page, fit all columns on one page, fit
all rows on one page, and custom scaling options where you can designate a
percentage for decreasing the size of characters on the printed page. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After making your choice, Tab once to get out of the combo box and lock
in your choice. There is no OK button here. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you are ready to send your work to the printer, Tab to the Print
button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scaling to fit does not change the point size in your
electronic file, but it does change the point size of the text sent to the
printer. You can calculate the point size of what is printed by pressing Alt P
X. This indicates the percent of scaling. The default is 100 percent for no
scaling. If you have introduced scaling, it might now say 75 percent. If the
default font size is 11 point, 75 percent of this equals an 8.25 point size.
You then need to judge if this is large enough to be easily visible to sighted
readers. If you opt for custom scaling, with the 11 point default, you probably
shouldn’t go much below 70 percent. The best strategy is to ask sighted people
who will be using the print out if they are able to read it.</p>

<h2>5.9 Additional Tools and Features</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Excel has many more tools and features. Some of the most
useful ones are described in this section. Two features unique to JAWS –
monitor cells and chart reading – are also described. </p>

<h3>5.9.1 Hiding and Unhiding Columns and Rows</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>In large sheets, using this feature aids efficient
navigation by temporarily hiding columns or rows so you can quickly skip over
them to get to columns or rows that interest you. Let’s say it’s now December
and you want to input data for that month’s bills. You would like to
temporarily hide all the columns from January through November. If you do this,
only three columns will remain visible: column A with the bill names, the
December column, and the Annual Total column. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for hiding the February through October columns
(columns B through L) are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor anywhere in Column B, hold down the Shift key and Right
arrow to select across to column L.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Spacebar to select these columns.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow twice to Hide, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In column A, you will now hear “adjacent to hidden cells.” Right
arrow once and you will be in column M, again hearing “adjacent to hidden
cells.” This indicates that columns B through L are hidden. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you are ready to unhide columns B through L, do the
following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your cursor on Column A (the column just to the left of the hidden
columns), hold down the Shift key and Right arrow once to column M (the column
just to the right of the hidden columns).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Spacebar to select these two columns.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow once to Unhide, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can follow a similar process to hide and unhide rows.
Remember that selecting multiple rows involves holding down the Shift key, Down
arrowing, and then pressing Shift Spacebar to select them. After selecting
rows, steps for hiding and unhiding them via the Applications key are the same
as for columns.</p>

<h3>5.9.2 Comments</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similar to Word, you can easily add comments to Excel
workbooks while reviewing work with collaborators. You might also insert
comments to explain how a formula was calculated or identify data sources.
Comments are cell-specific, so start with your cursor focus on the relevant
cell. Now press Shift F2, type in your text, and press Enter. Alternatively,
you can press the Applications key, Up arrow several times to New comment, and
add your comment from there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JAWS indicates that a cell has an associated comment by
saying, “has comment, contains note.” NVDA says “has comment,” and Narrator
says “contains note.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Excel 365 has added a feature for inserting notes. In
theory, these are different from comments in some way. However, as of the
writing of this book, I don’t think that any distinction is helpful, at least
for screen reader users. Regardless of whether you insert a comment or a note,
the screen readers say the same thing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While it is theoretically possible to reply to a comment, I
was not able to figure out how to do this. I suggest sticking with comments for
now. If you want people to reply to your comments, figure out a workaround of
some sort, rather than attempting to reply to a comment within the comments
feature framework. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To delete a comment, place your cursor on the associated
cell coordinate, Up arrow to Delete note and press Enter. Note that it might
say “delete comment” in earlier versions of Excel. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS you can press Control Shift Apostrophe to get a
list of comments. You can then Down arrow through them to hear them, as well as
press Enter on a comment to navigate to the associated cell. If your cursor
focus is on a cell containing a comment, you can press Alt Shift apostrophe to
hear it, as well as its author. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this time, neither NVDA nor Narrator have keystrokes for
accessing a list of comments. While it is theoretically possible to get a list
of comments in Excel itself, this does not give a list that is accessible.</p>

<h3>5.9.3 Removing Unwanted Verbosity </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may want to disable several Excel settings options that
create confusing and distracting verbosity. Repeated prompts like “Quick
analysis lens” or “Paste recovery options” can throw you off-track. When you
type formulas beginning with a letter, you may hear things like “=A abs,” or
“=B bottox,” which may confuse you. You can Eliminate this unwanted verbosity
in the Excel Options dialog. Note that each of the category dialog boxes are
extremely lengthy. Consequently, after making desired changes, it is much
quicker to Shift Tab back to the OK button rather than Tab forward to it. Note
also that the various settings are organized in groups, and as you tab through
them, yu must listen to the name of the group before hearing the dialog
element. If you tab through too quickly, you can easily skip over the one you
are looking for. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for making three changes I would suggest are as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F t to open the Excel Options Categories dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You first land on the General Category. Tab to the Show quick analysis
options checkbox (located in the User interface options group of this category)
and press the Spacebar to uncheck it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F t to reopen the Excel Options Categories dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow or press F to navigate to the Formulas Category.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tab to the Formula autocomplete checkbox (in the Working
with formulas group of this category), and press the Spacebar to uncheck it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F t to reopen the Excel Options Categories dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow or press A to navigate to the Advanced Category.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tab to the Show paste options button when content is pasted checkbox
(in the Cut, copy and paste options group of this category),  and press the
Spacebar to uncheck it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<h3>5.9.4 Monitor Cells With JAWS</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To facilitate quick navigation to especially important areas
of a large worksheet, you can designate up to ten monitor cells or data ranges.
You can set these up with shortcut keys or via Quick Settings. To do this using
shortcut keys, navigate to the cell you want to tag as a monitor cell. If it is
a data range, set the data range first. Then press Insert Shift 1 to tag it as
monitor cell one, Insert Shift 2 to designate it as monitor cell 2, and so on.
If you designate cell A5 as the first monitor cell, JAWS will say “setting
monitor cell 1 to A5.” You can easily reassign monitor cells. For example, if
you place the cursor on cell A14 and press Insert Shift 1, JAWS will warn you
that this monitor cell is already assigned and ask if you want to replace it.
Pressing Enter will confirm the reassignment of this monitor cell number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once assigned, you can read monitor cells individually or in
a list. Press Alt Shift 1 to read monitor cell one, Alt Shift 2 to read monitor
cell 2, and so on. Note that this only reads the cell content. It does not
navigate to that cell. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To open a list of monitor cells, press Control Shift M. I
especially like this feature because you can see all your monitor cell
coordinates and content together. Also, if you Down arrow to one of them and
press Enter, it will navigate to that monitor cell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also assign monitor cells, reassign them, and remove
assignments in Quick Settings (see Chapter 8.1.4.3).</p>

<h3>5.9.5 Creating Charts and Reading Them with JAWS</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Charts are visual presentations of data that are often more
effective for communicating results than tabular presentations. They are easy
to create. But you might assume that they are inaccessible to screen reader
users. Fortunately, JAWS has a very nice chart reading feature to make them
accessible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Among the most commonly used chart types are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Pie charts: Used to represent each data item as a percentage
share of a total value. Each item is represented as a slice of a pie. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Column charts: Typically used to compare several items in a
specific range of values, such as comparing sales volumes of several retail
stores. The numerical values appear as vertical columns. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Bar charts: Used to display the same data as column charts, but
as horizontal bars instead of vertical columns.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Line charts: Often used to present trends over time. Monthly
stock or commodity prices are examples. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will demonstrate by creating a pie chart showing the
number and percentage shares of annual tourist visits to New England from four
countries. If you are using JAWS and want to try it yourself, open the practice
file entitled, “New England Tourist Visits.xlsx.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The countries are listed in cells A2 through A5. The
corresponding numbers of tourist visits are listed in cells B2 through B5. The Steps
for creating the pie chart are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the data range containing the data, in this case A2 through B5. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Alt key to open the Upper ribbon. If you first land on the Home
tab, Right arrow once to the Insert tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Charts group is fairly deep into the Lower ribbon, so press Control Right
arrow several times until you land on the Charts group, the first item here
being the Recommended charts button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to the Insert pie or donut chart submenu, and press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You first land on the 2D pie button. This is a two-dimensional pie
chart. There are several other choices here that you can arrow through,
including a 3D pie chart which adds shading to give it a three-dimensional
effect. We will stick with the 2D pie chart, so press Enter on that.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The chart is now visible to the right of the data. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At this point, depending on your version of JAWS, sometimes
it immediately begins reading the entire chart content, other times it does
not. In any event, press Escape now. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To access the chart and have it read to you, press Control
Shift O which brings up a list of objects. “Objects” include charts, pictures,
and illustrations. After pressing Control Shift O, you will hear something like
“Chart 1, chart title E2 M17,” where cell E2 is the top left cell and M17 is
the bottom right cell of the range where the chart has been inserted in the
worksheet. This is the default chart title. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Press Enter on it to select it (note that you must press
Enter, Spacebar will not work), and JAWS will now start reading the chart’s
content to you. JAWS may read the chart continuously or just the first line. If
it stops reading after the first line, you can Down arrow to read it one line
at a time, or you can press Insert Down arrow to read it continuously. Here’s
what you will hear for this chart: “Chart Title, Description: Pie. Displays the
contribution of each value to a total., legend: Series1 has 4 slices, slice 1
CATEGORY=England, value=40000, contributes 27 percent, slice 2 CATEGORY=France,
value=30000, contributes 20 percent, slice 3 CATEGORY=Italy, value=20000,
contributes 13 percent, slice 4 CATEGORY=Canada, value=60000, contributes 40
percent, This sheet contains only the chart.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can move, copy or edit charts. Let’s say you would like
to change the data range where it appears visually on your worksheet. Do the
following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift O to access the list of objects. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If the pie chart is the only object in your worksheet, you land on it.
If not, Down arrow to it, and press Enter to select it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control X to cut it to the Clipboard. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the cell where you want its top left corner to appear and
press Control V to paste it there. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You could also copy the chart by pressing Control C instead
of Control X and paste it in a Word document. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, you can add chart titles, X and Y axis titles,
table legends, and data legends. To do this, first select the chart by pressing
Control Shift O, and Enter to select it. You can then press Alt to open the
Upper ribbon, and Right arrow to the Chart Layout tab of the ribbon. Here you
can Tab into the Lower ribbon to Chart title, Axis titles, Legend, or Data
Labels to add or change these.</p>

<h2>5.10 Strategies for Deciphering “Difficult” Spreadsheets</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, some spreadsheets you receive from sighted
people will not be laid out in a tidy rectangular block and may be difficult to
decipher. Among accountants, the convention is to add lots of empty cells
between the data. Spreading things out like this visually separates categories
and sub-categories. However, this makes it difficult for screen reader users to
interpret data. In addition, choosing the best cell to initiate the Define
names command can be challenging, and will probably yield less-than-perfect
results. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The practice file entitled “Temple Income and Expenses.xls”
is an example of a “difficult” spreadsheet. I received a version of this
spreadsheet from a student who serves on a budget committee at her temple. She
was having trouble figuring it out.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[5]</span></span></span></a>
The first clue that something funny was going on was when I pressed Control
Home. Rather than landing in cell A1, I landed in cell C3 instead. I correctly
guessed that the spreadsheet author was using the Freeze panes command. This is
the sighted equivalent of the Define names command. It is used to “freeze”
column and/or row headers so they can be visible no matter where the cursor is
located in a spreadsheet. This is useful for sighted users in large
spreadsheets. For example, if the cursor is located in cell O187, without
freezing the appropriate columns and rows, it will not be possible to interpret
the data in that cell without doing a lot of time-consuming navigation. This is
because the cursor is located too far down, as well as too far to the right, to
see the associated column and row headers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To verify whether Freeze panes is turned on, and to disable
it if you want to do that, the Freeze panes submenu is located in the View tab
of the ribbon. To disable it, press the shortcut Alt W F, and, assuming it is
checked, press Enter to disable it. Whether you disable it or not, you will
still be able to navigate in the range that is frozen by arrowing or Control
arrowing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pressing Control and the arrow keys is very useful in this
spreadsheet because its author has left many empty cells for visual layout
purposes. If you go to the top of column A of this spreadsheet, and press
Control Down arrow once, you jump to cell A3, which contains the word “Income.”
If you continue Control Down arrowing, you will jump to total income in cell
A33, expenses in A35, total expenses in cell A130, and net income in cell A132.
Obviously, just arrowing down would waste lots of time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Down arrowing through column B reveals actual budget line
items. Corresponding dollar amounts for each month begin in column C. Column
headers for the months February 2019 through February 2020 appear in cells C2through
Q2. Amounts are totaled in column S. Each of the monthly columns are visually
separated by empty columns. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If we place the cursor in cell B2 and initiate the Define
name command here, this will greatly aid data interpretation. Cell B2 is the
intersection of column B which contains the line items, and row 2 contains the
months. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After getting a grasp on the logic of how the categories are
organized in column A, and choosing the best cell to initiate the Define name
command, it is now possible to understand the financial data in columns C through
S. You will not be able to hear the categories (income, expenses, etc.) while
navigating within the body of the table, because categories and individual line
items are spread over two separate columns. However, you can now begin to
understand what is going on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Depending on how much effort you want to invest in making
this spreadsheet more efficient to navigate and easier to understand, several
tools discussed earlier in this chapter can be quite helpful. They are recapped
below.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Navigating with Control and the four arrow keys: In a large
spreadsheet with lots of empty cells, this is your “best friend” for quick
navigation. These key combinations will leapfrog you over groups of empty
cells, as well as over continuous ranges of cells filled with data. Control and
Down arrow together is especially useful for moving down the first few columns
of this spreadsheet because there are so many empty cells. Down arrowing cell
by cell would be Slow and frustrating. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If the spreadsheet author has enabled Freeze panes, there are
pros and cons related to disabling them. Unless you have some usable vision,
freezing panes may be of limited value to you. If you want to be able to press
Control Home to get to cell A1, which could make navigating this spreadsheet
more straightforward in some cases, disable Freeze panes by pressing Alt W F
and unchecking it here. That said, the most logical place for the spreadsheet
author to set Freeze panes is the cell containing the top left cell with data
values, situated just to the right of its corresponding row header, and just
below its corresponding column header. If this is indeed the case, keeping
Freeze panes enabled and pressing Control Home will quickly get you to that top
left data cell. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Hiding columns: Because this is a spreadsheet that is presumably
updated and distributed on a monthly basis, you might only be interested in
examining financial data for the most recent month. But because the author has
inserted empty columns between each data column, navigating to the far right
side of the spreadsheet is tedious. To render this more efficient, you can hide
the columns not of immediate interest to you. That way, it will be much quicker
to get to the columns that you want to examine. In this spreadsheet, you may
only be interested in viewing the February 2020 and totals columns (columns Q and
S). If so, you can hide columns C through P. See Chapter 5.9.1 on how to do
this. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Assigning monitor cells with JAWS: You might find that certain
cells are especially important. For example, cells S33, S130, and S132 present totals
for income, expenses, and net income, respectively. Assigning monitor cells to
each of these will enable you to navigate to them quickly. See Chapter 5.9.4
about how to assign monitor cells with JAWS and navigate to them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Adding comments: If you assign monitor cells to each of the
three cells just mentioned, this is useful for navigation purposes, but you may
not remember what the data in these cells refer to. You can add comments to each
of them to remind you (Chapter 5.9.2).<br clear=all style='page-break-before:

<p class=MsoNormal>PowerPoint enables you to produce slide show presentations
for target audiences. It has become ubiquitous at conferences and workshops. It
is often simply expected that speakers will be providing a PowerPoint
presentation to participants. Students are also often required to prepare
PowerPoints for class projects. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will begin with a short section on how to read an existing
PowerPoint presentation. Even if you are not interested in learning how to
produce a presentation, read this section if you don’t know the keystrokes for
reading presentations. They are not intuitive. And even though you may not plan
on producing PowerPoint presentations yourself, you will almost certainly
receive presentations from others and will want to know how to read them. I
will then go through the steps of preparing a presentation and then discuss
formatting considerations. </p>

<h2>6.1 Reading a Presentation</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you open an existing presentation, you land in a list
of slides called the Normal view. Press Page down once to move to the second
slide. Your screen reader will tell you the title of that slide and say, “2 of
22,” indicating that you have landed on the second slide in a presentation with
a total of 22 slides, or whatever the total number might be. Continue pressing
Page down to hear more titles. You can press the home and end keys to get to
the first and last slides in the presentation, respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To read the full presentation, press the F5 key to open the
Slide show view. Regardless of where your cursor is in the list of slides,
pressing F5 will always open the Slide Show on the first slide. The entire text
of the first slide should then be read to you. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes when you open the Slide show view, a glitch
occurs. Your screen reader does not automatically read the first slide. You can
use standard reading keystrokes to read the text here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now press the Spacebar to go to the second slide and have it
read to you. Note that the misbehavior mentioned above only occurs with the
first slide. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To go back a slide and have it read to you, press the
Backspace key. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within any slide, you can use standard reading keystrokes to
read the text:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Right/Left arrow: Move to and read characters to the right and
left.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control Right/Left arrow: Move to and read words to the right and
left.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Down/Up arrow: Move to and read line below and above.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Insert Down arrow: JAWS and Narrator Say all command or
continuous reading from the point of the cursor. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Insert A: NVDA Say all command or continuous reading from the
cursor. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that these keys work only within an individual slide.
If you press your screen reader’s Say all key, it will read to the bottom of
that slide and stop. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When finished reading the presentation, press Escape to exit
the Slide show view and return to the Normal view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If your cursor is somewhere in the middle of the list of
slides (say, the seventh slide), and you would like to get back into Slide show
view from that point, rather than pressing F5, which always begins reading on
the first slide, press Shift F5 and the Slide show view will open at that
point. As above, press Spacebar and backspace to go forward and backwards one
slide, respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To summarize, the keystrokes you need to know are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>F5: Open the Slide show view to the first slide and read it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Spacebar: Go to the next slide and read it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Backspace: Go to the previous slide and read it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Shift F5: Open the Slide show view beginning with the currently
selected slide.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Escape: Exit the Slide show view.</p>

<h2>6.2 Creating Slides in the Slide Area Pane</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Individual slides are created and edited in the Slide area
pane. Similar to a window on a house, a pane is a section of a window. The
PowerPoint screen is partitioned into six panes. Move between them by pressing
F6 and Shift F6. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With your current focus in the Slide area pane, press F6 to
move between the following panes: the Status bar, the Toolbar, the Upper
ribbon, the Slide Thumbnails pane, and wrap back to the Slide area pane. For
the moment, the Slide Notes pane does not appear. The Slide thumbnails and
Slide Notes panes will be discussed later in this chapter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It can be confusing to follow instructions in the abstract.
I suggest that you read through each section here and then use the information
to prepare a presentation. Appendix III includes a step-by-step exercise that
you can use for preparing a sample presentation. </p>

<h3>6.2.1 The Title Slide</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you open PowerPoint, by default you land on a blank
title slide. This will be the first slide of your presentation. There are two
fields you can fill in: a title and sub-title field. You move between these
fields by pressing the tab key. Press tab once and your screen reader will say
“title placeholder.” Press tab again and it will say “subtitle placeholder.”
Press Tab a third time and you will wrap back around to the Title placeholder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You hear the term “placeholder” a lot with PowerPoint. A
placeholder is, well, a place that holds something. That “something” could be
text, a graphic, or a media icon for an audio or video clip. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Insert text by tabbing to a placeholder and pressing Enter.
After inserting your text, press Escape to exit edit mode. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you are in the Placeholder edit field, only press enter
or tab if you want to add a new line or insert a tab in that placeholder.
Initially, pressing escape may be counter-intuitive as a way to lock text into
a placeholder, but you may eventually get used to the rhythm of tab, enter,
escape, tab, enter, and escape. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you navigate through the slide area, you will hear what
type of placeholder you are on. The types and number of placeholders depend on
the slide type you are using. I will discuss the various slide types later. For
the moment, we’ll stick with the Title slide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you heard while tabbing around, a title slide has two
placeholders: a title placeholder and a subtitle placeholder. To prepare a
title slide: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open PowerPoint and press Escape to get out of the Backstage view. You
first hear “No selection. To select an object press Tab.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Title placeholder and press enter. This opens an edit field. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in the title of your presentation. You should keep it short because
the font size in the final presentation will be quite large.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Escape. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Subtitle placeholder and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in typical subtitle content like your name, organization, and/or
presentation date. Press Enter after each of these to place them on their own
line. Here too, keep the amount of text limited.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Escape to exit the Subtitle placeholder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is good practice to detect any errors and correct them
before continuing to the next slide. Tab a couple of times to hear your title
and subtitle again. To edit any placeholder text, tab to it, press Enter, and
revise text within the placeholder using standard editing keystrokes, press
Escape when done to exit edit mode. </p>

<h3>6.2.2 Other Slide Layout Types </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You have now created your title slide and it’s time to start
in on slide 2. PowerPoint has a gallery of slide layout types that can be
accessed via the ribbon menus, using the Applications key or using the shortcut
key (Alt H I). We’ll first go there via the ribbons:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press alt to open the ribbon menus, press tab several times to the New
Slide split button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press alt and Down arrow to expand the options.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This opens a set of buttons that you can arrow through. Slide types
include: title, one content, two content, comparison, title only, content with
caption, and picture with caption. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter or the Spacebar on your layout choice for the next slide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To get to the same place using the Applications key, press
the Applications key, Down arrow to the Layout submenu and press enter. This
opens the same array of slide type choices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, the ribbon sequence of Alt H I also gets you into
the choice of slide types.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here’s an explanation of the nine built-in slide layout
types: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Title: Discussed above.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Title and content: Title and single object placeholder for a
total of two placeholders. Text entered on each line of the object placeholder
will automatically be bulleted. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Section header: Title and single object placeholder for a total
of two placeholders. Text entered on each line of the object placeholder will
not be bulleted. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Title and two content: Title and two object placeholders on left
and right for a total of three placeholders.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Comparison: Title and a body and object placeholder on the left,
and a body and object placeholder on the right for a total of five
placeholders. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Title only: Title placeholder at top center only. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Blank: No placeholders.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Content with caption: A title, object and body placeholder. The
body placeholder appears under the object placeholder. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Picture with caption: A title, and body placeholder. The body
placeholder appears under the placeholder. It is not possible to enter text in
the placeholder – only graphics or audio/video icons can be inserted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use the comparison slide layout for juxtaposing good and
bad, pros and cons, old an new, etc. However, keep in mind that, with five
placeholders, a comparison slide can quickly get cluttered and may be difficult
to manage from a non-visual perspective. It might be better to split the
information between two slides, the first one covering the good, pros, old,
etc., and the second one covering the bad, cons, new, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you add a new slide, the first time you press the Tab
key, focus will land on the Title placeholder. For two content and comparison
slides, tabbing between placeholders proceeds in a counter-clockwise direction
from the Title placeholder, and wraps back around to it. For any of the other
slide types with two or more placeholders, tabbing proceeds vertically
downwards from the Title placeholder, and also wraps back around to it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several ways to create a new slide were laid out above.
There is a fourth way using Control M. If you press Control M after preparing
the Title slide, a Title and Content slide will appear. Pressing Control M
after any of the other slide layout types listed above will insert a new slide
of that same type. For example, if you have just prepared a Comparison slide
and press Control M, a new blank Comparison slide will appear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To prepare a second slide, using the Title and Content slide
type and the Ribbon shortcut key combination. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt H I to get into the New slide gallery.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow once to the Title and content button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Title placeholder, press enter to get in edit mode, and
type in the title for your second slide. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press escape, tab to the object placeholder, and press enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in text for your first talking point, and press Enter to go to the
next line.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in text for your second talking point, and press Enter to go to the
next line.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat the above steps to input your remaining talking points.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When finished, press Escape to exit the placeholder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that bullet points have automatically been added. This
is the case for all object placeholders. For body placeholders, you can enter
text, but bullets are not automatically added. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now you can continue to add new slides, either pressing
Control M to add a new slide of the same type you have just used, or pressing
Alt H I or the Applications key, and arrowing to a different slide layout type
and pressing enter or Spacebar to add it. </p>

<h3>6.2.3 Inserting Pictures and Alt Text</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>As they say, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” A
presentation with only text is boring. Add pictures and other types of graphics
to enhance the visual appeal of your presentation. Graphics should reenforce
the message of your content. They should not be superfluous eye candy or
gimmicky distractions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pictures can be obtained from several sources: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Files saved on your PC, usually in JPG (often called “J peg”) or
PNG file format.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Searching for them online via the PowerPoint menus.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Reputable websites with collections of images. These sites have
free public domain images, images you have to pay for, and both. Unfortunately,
very few of these sites are accessible.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Copying images off of websites. Be sure you are not violating any
copyright laws before using these images. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will only cover using files already loaded onto your
computer. Online searches are not very accessible, and I have not yet
discovered an accessible site for downloading images. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can easily copy and paste files already stored on your
computer. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the image file on your computer.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Alt Tab to PowerPoint where you have already opened a new slide and Tab
to the object placeholder where you want to insert the image. It is not
necessary to press Enter to open the placeholder. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control V to paste the picture into the placeholder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The picture now appears visually, and it is sized down from
its original dimensions to fit into the placeholder. However, with some
versions of PowerPoint other than the 365 licensed version, the blind screen
reader user receives no audio feedback. With PowerPoint 365, text is
automatically generated using artificial intelligence (AI). Yet this text is
very generic and rarely helpful. For example, “when I inserted the iconic photo
of Boston Bruins star Bobby Orr flying through the air after scoring the winning
goal of the 1970 Stanley Cup finals, the AI-generated alt text was, “A picture
containing outdoor, feet.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, even if AI-generated alt text is automatically inserted,
you will usually want to replace it with your own alt text to succinctly
describe image content. Steps for doing this are: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your focus on the placeholder where you have pasted the picture,
press the Applications key, Up arrow to Edit alt text, and press Enter. Your
screen reader will say “description edit.” It may or may not also speak any
AI-generated text. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If AI-generated text is present, press Control A to select it all before
typing in your replacement text over it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type a short description of the picture.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Escape key when you are finished. Your new alt text should now
be spoken by your screen reader program. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If, during the same session, you repeat the steps above to
add alt text to a second image, you will run into a minor glitch. You will not
be able to access the Description edit field mentioned above. There are two
ways to remedy this. You can save your work, exit PowerPoint, and reopen your
presentation. The steps above will work properly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alternatively, while in the same session, and with your
focus on the placeholder where you have pasted the second picture, press F6
until you hear Description edit. Now type in your alt text and press the Escape
key. Note that, with PowerPoint 365, when you press F6, you may hear “turn off
design ideas for this session link.” If you do, press the Spacebar to disable
this, and then press F6 until you return to the same place. This time around,
it will say “Description edit.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To delete a picture from your presentation, Tab to the
placeholder containing it and press the Delete key to remove it. No
confirmation is requested. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After inserting a picture, run the slide show and get
confirmation from a sighted person that it is properly sized. It usually will
be, but in case it is not, you can change its dimensions. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the object placeholder where the picture is located to place
focus on it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow to Size and position, and press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to either the Height or Width edit spin box. The current height and
width of the image appears in inches. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You can adjust either of these by up or Down arrowing to another value,
or by typing in a new value. If you change the height, the width will
automatically adjust, and vice versa. This ensures that the picture does not
get distorted.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Lock adjust ratio checkbox and be sure it is checked. This
setting prevents distortion. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Once again, get sighted confirmation that the picture is correctly sized
in the Slide show view.</p>

<h3><a name="_Hlk54269226">6.2.4 Inserting Audio and Video Clips</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is easy to insert short audio and video clips into a
presentation. Common audio file types areMP3 and WAV. Common video file types
include MP4 and WMV. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For files on your computer, follow the same steps outlined
above for selecting, copying, and pasting pictures. After inserting these
clips, the audio feedback you receive will differ depending on your version of
PowerPoint. With my 365 version, when I Tab to the placeholder where I have
inserted the clip, my screen reader says “audio” and “video” for these file
types. For earlier versions of PowerPoint or your screen reader, your screen
reader may say “media” for both file types. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want to hear your clip while in the Slide area pane,
with your focus on the placeholder with the clip, press Alt P to play and pause
it, and Alt Q to restart it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s say you have added your audio or video clip to a title
and content slide. During the slide show, when you press the Spacebar to open
the slide containing an audio or video clip, by default, your screen reader
first says the title of the slide, as well as any other text inserted in
placeholders before the audio or video in a counter-clockwise direction.
Pressing the Spacebar a second time then plays the audio or video clip. You can
press the Spacebar again if you want to stop it from playing before it ends. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is possible to start playing the clip immediately upon
opening a slide without having to press the Spacebar a second time. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor on the placeholder containing the audio or video clip.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon and Right arrow to the Playback tab.
This tab only appears if your cursor focus is on the placeholder containing the
media file. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times into the Lower ribbon to the Start combo box, and
press Alt Down arrow to expand it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Automatically button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now when you press the Spacebar to open this slide in the
slide show, instead of hearing the title first, your clip immediately starts
playing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To delete an audio or video clip, as with pictures, Tab to
the placeholder containing it and press the Delete key to remove it. </p>

<h2>6.3 Slide Thumbnails Pane</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each slide is prepared and edited in the Slide area pane. In
the Slide Thumbnails pane, you can delete, copy, and move slides that you have
already created. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Slide area and Slide Thumbnails panes are adjacent, so
you can move back and forth between them by pressing F6 and Shift F6.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Slide Thumbnails pane, down and Up arrow through your
slides. You will hear the title of each slide. Using standard windows
keystrokes, it is easy to edit the presentation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To Delete a slide, after up or Down arrowing to it, press
the Delete key. No confirmation is requested. The slide simply disappears. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>To move a slide
elsewhere in the presentation order:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow to the slide to select it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control X to cut it to the Clipboard. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control V to paste it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To make a copy of a slide and place it somewhere else in the
presentation order, repeat the steps above, just pressing Control C rather than
Control X in the second step to copy the slide to the Clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are several reasons why you might want to delete or
move slides. After you have concentrated your efforts on creating your slides,
you may think a different order is more logical or makes the presentation flow
better. You may need to delete some slides because of time limits placed on
your presentation by meeting organizers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you will be making repeated presentations on a particular
topic to a variety of audiences in the future, you may create a master
presentation with a lot of slides. You can then use the Slide Thumbnails pane
to create different versions of your presentation, tailoring them to different
audiences and time limits for the meetings where you will be speaking. If you
create a new presentation based on slides from a master presentation, be sure
to save the new presentation with a different filename. </p>

<h2>6.4 Slide Notes Pane</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can add notes to provide more details to your
presentation. These notes can serve as reminders of the things you want to say
during your talk. Because they are included in the PowerPoint file, they can be
sent to meeting participants so they have them for future reference. They can
also be printed out for hard copy distribution. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Visually, the Slide Notes pane appears directly below the Slide
area pane as a large edit box. Slide notes are not visible to audiences while
presentations are being given. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Slide Notes pane does not initially appear when you
cycle through the panes with the F6 key. To make it appear, press F6 until you
hear Toolbar Spellcheck. Tab once to the Slide notes button and press Enter or
the Spacebar. Continue pressing F6 to get to the Slide Notes pane. It is one
pane before the Slide Thumbnails pane. Once again, the pane order is Slide
notes, Slide thumbnails, and Slide area. Any notes you add should be associated
with individual slides. To add notes:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After making the Slide Notes pane appear, press F6 until you get to the
Slide Thumbnails pane.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow to the slide for which you want to create notes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Shift F6 to go to the associated edit field in the Slide Notes
pane.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in your notes. However, keep in mind that it is easier to type them
first in Word and copy and paste them here, rather than typing them in
directly. This is because editing and spellchecking within the Slide Notes pane
works poorly.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When finished, press F6 once to return to the Slide Thumbnails pane,
arrow down to the next slide for which you want to add notes, and repeat the
steps above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want your screen reader to read the notes for a given
slide while in the Slide show view, press Control Shift N. After reading the
notes, press Control Shift N again to return to the slide show.</p>

<h2>6.5 Formatting Considerations </h2>

<h3>6.5.1 Themes</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A theme provides a consistent format for the background
pattern, font style, point size and color, as well as the bullet shape, color,
and size, of all your slides. Themes can be applied at any time in the process
of creating your presentation. The default theme is called “Office.” It is
simply black text on a white background – very plain and boring. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of the time, you will probably want to change it to
something more colorful. Changing the theme is easy, but there is one big
problem. The names of the themes are completely non-descript. Facet, gallery
and integral are typical examples. Consequently, independently making an
informed choice is inaccessible. Therefore, you will need sighted assistance to
choose a theme. Also keep in mind that some themes have font styles and colors
that may be easier, or more difficult, for someone with low vision or color
blindness to read. Avoid choosing such themes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It would be desirable for Microsoft to provide short
descriptions of the themes somewhere. Unfortunately, I have never found any.
Later in this section, I will provide descriptions of themes you may want to
choose. I will also identify themes to avoid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To change from the Office default theme to another one:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Alt key and Right arrow to the Design tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once into the Lower ribbon to the Themes submenu and press Enter.
This opens a grid palette with small pictures of the theme background patterns
and font colors visible to sighted users. The first time you come here, you
will hear “Office theme selected,” indicating this to be your current theme. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Use the four arrow keys to move around in the palette grid and press
Enter or the Spacebar on your choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your entire slide show will now appear using this theme. You
can change it to a different theme at any time. The next time you open the
Themes submenu, your current theme will be indicated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many organizations have created their own theme templates in
order to ensure consistent branding for its presentations. If you are preparing
a presentation for your organization, be sure to check if a company template
already exists. If so, it may be the policy of your organization to use that
theme.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You should use font colors that clearly contrast with your
background, such as dark against a light background or light against a dark
background. Use a solid background color rather than a multi-colored pattern
for easier readability. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Below are descriptions of several themes which provide
adequate color contrast between foreground text and background patterns, and
may be acceptable to use from an accessibility standpoint:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Organic: The slide background resembles a light fine-grained
wooden board. Title and subtitle placeholders are on top of a white square with
a thin green inside border. The text is dark grey. A horizontal green line
provides visual separation between the placeholders. The text color and
horizontal line are similar for other slide types. A brown ribbon extends from
either side of the Title placeholder and appears to wrap around the wooden
board. Other slides have a thin, light wooden border around the entire slide.
The remaining background is white with a thin, green inside border. Bullets are
solid green and round. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Parallax: The Title slide has a light gray background which is
slightly darker on the left and right, and becomes lighter towards the middle.
Two blue and darker gray strips start near the upper left side of the slide.
They get a bit thicker and curve slightly to the right as they descend towards
just above the middle center of the slide. This provides a subtle
three-dimensional effect as slide content seems to come closer. The background
pattern is similar for other slide types, but with the blue and gray curving
strips descending further down the slide as they curve towards the center.
Placeholder text is black providing adequate contrast against the light gray
background. Bullets are solid, round, and filled with the same blue as the blue
strip in the background.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Slate: The slide background is a rough textured black pattern
resembling tile or slate roof shingles. Placeholder text is white. Bullets are
white diamonds. White on black provides a good color contrast. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Vapor trail: The Title slide has a black background with
multi-color ribbons or “vapors” swirling around on top of the black. Shades of
a red and orange ribbon tinged with black swoop upwards towards the middle top
of the slide. Green and blue ribbons appear at the top right. Swirling red
ribbons appear on the lower left side, morphing to green and blue as one moves
across to the right. Title and subtitle placeholder text is white on a black
background with clear contrast. Other slide types contain the same design along
the top, but solid black further down the slide. Placeholder text is white.
Object placeholder bullets are solid white circles. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Wood type: The Title slide has a white background. The Title
placeholder has its own background pattern - gray mottled with fine white dots.
Text is black with small white flecks. The Subtitle placeholder text is solid
black. To the right and slightly above the Subtitle placeholder, is a red
circle with small white flecks, as well as a single white line crossing it.
Other slides have a similar pattern as the Title slide, but the red circle is
smaller and the Title placeholder background is white. Object placeholder
bullets are solid red squares. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Avoid the following themes due to poor color contrast:
facet, slice, banded, basis, circuit, frame, metropolitan, parcel, and
quotable.</p>

<h3>6.5.2 Background Colors</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To apply a solid color background rather than a theme, do
the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Hlk55040606">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in the Slide area pane, press Escape to be sure you have not
selected a placeholder. If you up and Down arrow, you should hear “no
selection.”</a></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Upper ribbon and arrow to the Design tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Format background button and press Enter (shortcut: Alt G F).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A color palette opens where you can arrow among different colors and
shades of those colors. Press Enter or the Spacebar on your choice. To ensure
correct color contrast, choose a light background color if you are using a dark
font color for the foreground, or vice versa.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Apply to all button and press Enter to apply this background
color to the entire presentation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you wish to alter the background color during the same
session, you will need to press F6 a couple of times to get back to these
settings. Doing this through the Design tab will not work. If you save your
presentation, exit out of it, and reopen it, you can apply a new color through
the ribbons. </p>

<h3>6.5.3 Changing Font Color</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you decide to change the background color instead of
using themes, you will also want to change the font color. The default font
color is black. You would not want to leave it this way if you made the
background color blue. Change the font color only after you have prepared all
your slides because the directions below only change font color for
previously-created slides, not any subsequent ones. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the View tab in the Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Outline view and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press F6 until you get to the Outline Tab. This replaces the Slide Thumbnails
pane when you switch to Outline view.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control A to select all.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Go to the Home tab of the ribbon. Tab into the Lower ribbon to the Font
color split button, and press Alt Down arrow to expand it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This opens a color palette where you can use the four arrows to navigate
through the choices. Similar to the background colors, they are organized in
different shades.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on your choice.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To verify that your color change took effect, press F6 to go to the Slide
area pane, Tab to one of the placeholders to give it focus.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert F to check formatting. Your new color should be identified.
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Down
arrow to several other slides and repeat the above two steps to check that the
color has changed elsewhere in the presentation.</p>

<h3>6.5.4 Transitions</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Slide transitions are visual effects and sounds that affect
the slide as a whole when you move from one slide to the next when in Slide
show view. By default, slides silently appear as you move from one slide to the
next during a slide show. Different visual and auditory effects can be
introduced. However, be careful about using these. Anything too flashy or
dramatic can seem gimmicky, diverting audience attention away from the actual
content of your presentation. Overdoing it can even annoy audience members, so
use transitions sparingly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will first cover visual transitions. You can apply
transitions to individual slides, as well as to all of them. To apply a
transition to an individual slide:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In either the Slide area or Slide Thumbnails pane, navigate to the slide
for which you want to set a transition. This will be the transition for when
that slide opens during a slide show.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Alt key to open the Upper ribbon and Right arrow to the
Transitions tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon to the Transition effects submenu and press
Enter. This opens a grid. Use the four arrow keys to move around. Press the
Spacebar on your choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As with themes, many of the transition names (morph, push,
reveal, etc.) give you no idea about what they actually do. Other names (fade,
blinds, dissolve) may give you some notion. Here too, you will need sighted
assistance to describe the effect. As mentioned above, use them sparingly, if
at all. My own personal inclination is to not use them, or only use very subtle
ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you have applied a transition to a single slide as
described above, you can apply that same transition to all slides in your
presentation. With your focus on that same slide, in the Transitions tab, tab
to the Apply to all button and press Enter or the Spacebar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>To apply a
sound transition to a single slide:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In either the Slide area or Slide Thumbnails pane, navigate to the slide
for which you want to set a transition. This will be the sound you hear when
that slide opens during the slide show.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Alt key to open the Upper ribbon and Right arrow to the
Transitions tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab into the Lower ribbon until you hear Timing sound combo box. Press
Enter to open it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow through the choices and press Enter on your choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Among the choices are applause, arrow, bomb, click and cash
register. There are numerous others. Once again, use these sparingly. You might
use cash register a single time to inject a little humor into your presentation
on a slide related to money, but once is plenty. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As with visual transitions, you can apply sound transitions
to all slides. The only one I use is the click sound because it is very subtle
and has a practical use. It will give you a little more auditory confirmation
when you are moving from slide to slide. Otherwise, exercise caution when
applying sounds to all slides because any of the more noticeable sound
transitions may distract or annoy your audience. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Animations are another commonly used visual effect. These
allow individual bullet points to fly into object placeholders during slide
shows, Many sighted PowerPoint users like using these because it makes
participants focus their attention on just one bullet at a time, rather than
wander elsewhere on the slide. Animations could also be useful for non-visual
presenters because they could hear just one bullet point at a time, rather than
hearing the entire text of a slide all at once. Unfortunately, as of the
writing of this book, they were not accessible with screen readers. Although
creating animations is fully accessible, during a slide show, screen readers
still read entire slides rather than one bullet at a time. Hopefully, this
accessibility problem will be fixed in the future. </p>

<h2>6.6 Practical Tips for Creating and Delivering Presentations</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Especially when new to PowerPoint, thinking about
presentation content, slide type choice, moving around between placeholders and
editing text, and manipulating the awkward JAWS spellcheck workaround (See
Chapter 9.1.3) can be too much to juggle all at once. Consequently, you may
prefer to create content in Word, edit it and spellcheck it there, and then
copy and paste the text into PowerPoint. That way, you can initially focus on
preparing your text in a more familiar typing and editing environment. To make
it easy to navigate through your slides, as well as keep track of how many you
have, think about marking up each slide title with headings in Word. Don’t
bullet text in Word because this will be done automatically when you copy the
text from Word and paste it into PowerPoint object placeholders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While in Word, don’t worry too much about the final order of
the slides in your presentation. Reordering is easy to do in the Slide Thumbnails
pane. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Limit each slide to just a few bullet points. Do not write
full sentences because this may tempt you to read them out loud word-for-word.
Excessive text is the most common symptom of a poor PowerPoint presentation. It
indicates that the speaker is a PowerPoint amateur, lacks confidence in his or
her grasp of the material, that he or she has weak presentation skills, or some
combination of all of these. And if you type in too much text, font size
automatically gets smaller, even to the point of making it extremely difficult
for sighted observers to read from the back of a room. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All slide titles should be written in title case. The first
letter of the first word of each bullet point should be capitalized, but no
other words should start with a capital letter, unless of course other words
are proper nouns or acronyms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here’s a piece of advice that is so obvious that you may
wonder why I even mention it. Be 100 percent sure that all your text is spelled
correctly. The sad fact is that I have seen presentations sprinkled with
incorrect spelling. The presenter is broadcasting in big bold fonts to a large
audience his or her lack of professionalism. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While most of the steps for preparing PowerPoints are fully
accessible, ask a sighted colleague to review the visual appearance of your
slide show to be sure that:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Text and images are large enough to be seen from the back of a
meeting room.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Color contrast between the foreground text and the background
pattern is crisp and clear.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Font style, color and size are consistent.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Placeholders are not overlapping.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Graphics such as imported photos are properly sized, correctly
oriented, and are crisp and clear. If instead, they are fuzzy, this is probably
because of insufficient pixelation. If this is the case, replace them because
they will not look good when projected on a large screen. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Visual slide transitions are not distracting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Practice your delivery several times in private. Better yet,
also do a dry run in front of trusted colleagues. These are the best ways to
ensure that you respect the time limits imposed by meeting organizers. It will
also help you to avoid needless meandering and repetition. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, you have finalized your presentation and it is now time
to deliver it to a real live audience. If you are doing this face-to-face in a
physical location, be sure to get there early enough to test out the technology
you will be using to give your talk. If you are delivering it on your own
laptop, take time with meeting organizers to hook up your laptop to the
projection screen. Ask ahead of time about what connector cable type you will
need to connect your laptop to the projector or monitor where you will be
displaying your slides. Test out any microphones and speakers you will be using
to ensure that the audio works properly. Give yourself ample time to do this
because if there are any unforeseen glitches, the last thing you want to do is
start delivering your presentation to a live audience before you have recovered
your composure. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If delivering your presentation remotely via a platform like
Zoom Cloud Meeting, here too, join the meeting ahead of time and test with the
meeting host that screen sharing is working properly. Usually, you will only
want to share the visual screen and not audio. You don’t want your screen
reader rattling off all your bulleted text each time you open a new slide. One
nice thing about Zoom is that if you only share your visual screen while
wearing headphones, you can hear your screen reader speak the text of your
slide show, but your audience will not. Of course, if some audience members are
blind or visually-impaired, take time to adequately explain your text to them
and describe any graphics where you have added alt text. Email them your
presentation prior to the meeting, or shortly afterwards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are delivering your slide show face-to-face from your
laptop, turn down the computer volume to the lowest level where you can still
hear the audio clearly, but others can not. If you are positioned at a podium
or a head table, chances are you will be far enough apart from your audience so
they will hear little or none of your screen reader speech. Alternatively, you
can wear a small single earphone. That way, you can hear your slide show with
one ear and audience reaction with the other one. Finally, if you are a fluent
Braille reader, you can print out your text on an embosser and silently refer
back to it while speaking, or use an electronic braille notetaker.</p>

7 Browsing the Web</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>This chapter reviews keystrokes for reading web page content
with the three screen readers. Many of the keystrokes are the same. If you are
already comfortable with one screen reader, you can pick up the basics of
another one fairly quickly. The chapter also identifies general strategies for
effective web navigation. Browser programs covered are Google Chrome, Microsoft
Edge, and Mozilla Firefox. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Much of this chapter’s content is drawn from my book
entitled “When One Web Browser Is Not Enough: A Guide for Windows Screen Reader
Users,” which came out in August 2020. It covers more topics related to web
browsing than are contained in this chapter. I hope to eventually update it
because, as of the release of this book about a year and a half later, a number
of techniques and processes described in the book were no longer valid. Unlike
most other applications covered in this book, procedures for executing commands
and adjusting settings frequently change for the various web browser
applications. Therefore, please keep in mind that things may have changed
between the time this chapter was finalized in December 2021 and when you get
around to reading it.</p>

<h2>7.1 The Most Important Keystrokes for Web Navigation</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first thing to say about navigating the web with a
screen reader program is that there is good news and bad news. The good news:
if you can master about a dozen keystrokes, you are well on your way to being
able to effectively navigate the web with all three browsers. The bad news:
every website is different. No matter how proficient you get with these and
other keystroke combinations, some sites may be difficult or impossible to
navigate because the web developer did not adequately take accessibility into
account when designing the site. Another possibility is that sites were
developed and tested using one or two browsers and not the others, leading to
variations in accessibility. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whatever the reason, there will be times when a site is more
accessible using one browser, and less accessible using another. When you
encounter a roadblock with one browser, your first trouble shooting strategy
should be to try another one. This is the most important reason for being
comfortable using multiple browsers. A second strategy to try when running into
roadblocks is to switch screen readers. Trying various combinations of browsers
and screen readers increases your chances of getting the information you want
from finicky websites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because every website is different, consider the various
keystrokes enumerated in this section as a set of tools to be used flexibly. If
one keystroke doesn’t do the job, reach into your tool bag and try another one.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For screen reader users, it often appears that web pages are
cluttered with lots of extraneous stuff: ads, decorative graphics, and social
media links that just get in your way. Your goal should be to quickly jump over
the clutter in order to zero in on meaningful content. Screen reader programs
have an array of keystrokes that help you accomplish this. Fortunately, many of
these keystrokes are the same for JAWS, NVDA, and Narrator. There are also a
number of Windows keystrokes that are universal across all browsers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Real estate agents stress the importance of “location,
location, location.” To become an effective web surfer, “listen, listen,
listen!” When exploring websites, constantly ask yourself questions like: Was
that a heading? Which level was it? Was that a button? If so, can I Press B for
button to get there faster next time? What was the first letter of that link?
If I bring up the Links list, will first lettering to it be the fastest way to
get there? Is that the only edit box or combo box on the page? If so, can I
just Press E or C from anywhere on the page to quickly jump there? While this
may sound like audio overload, you can train your ears so that effective
listening becomes second nature. Moving around web pages will become less
frustrating and more fun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now let’s talk about how you might go about exploring an
unfamiliar website to get a broad sense of what information is available on the
site and how you might quickly find content. First, how do you get to a new website?
If you open a browser, and do not land on a web page, you can immediately type
in the site address and press Enter. If you first land on a web page, press Alt
D or F6 in any browser to access the Address Bar, type in the web address, and
press Enter. See Chapter 7.6 below for more details about opening web pages. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I go to a website for the first time, I want to know
right off the bat how many headings and links are on the page. Your screen
reader will often tell you this information when you open the page, but not
always. A lot of accompanying noise is also present so you may not catch this
information. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JAWS and Narrator can both give summary information with a
single keystroke. With JAWS, from the top of the page, press Insert F1 to open
JAWS Screen-Sensitive Help. You will hear the number of links and headings on
the page. After hearing this information, press Escape to exit the virtual
viewer and return to the web page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With Narrator, press Insert S for a similar summary. With
Narrator, you can also press Insert plus S twice quickly to get the following
info: the number of links, landmarks, and headings on a page, and a list of
popular links for a page, these being links on the page that get the most
traffic. The Popular links feature is unique to Narrator. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS and Narrator, you can also press Insert F6 and
Insert F7 to get lists of headings and links, respectively. Both will tell you
how many of each are on the page. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NVDA does not have separate keystrokes for accessing lists
of headings and links. All are found in the Elements list dialog. Lists of form
fields and buttons are also found here. To access the Elements list dialog, do
the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert F7 to land in the Elements list dialog. This puts you in a
tree view of one of these element types, although it may not initially be
apparent which type is being listed.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Shift Tab once to go to a set of radio buttons with types of
elements. Use the Up and Down arrow keys to go to the Headings radio button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab once to go to the Headings tree view. Unfortunately, what you
hear is confusing because NVDA presents the information in a tree view rather
than in a simple list view. Tree views are organized in levels different than
those of headings. For level one headings, NVDA will say “level zero” because
it is identifying its level in the tree view hierarchy rather than its level in
the headings hierarchy. Level one in the tree view hierarchy means it is a
level two heading, and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab once again and arrow up or down to the Links Radio button. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once and the Links tree view now appears. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press escape to exit the Elements list dialog. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why is this information useful? Headings are the screen
reader user’s “best friend” for web navigation. When properly incorporated by
web developers, headings and their hierarchy mark up web pages similar to how
an outline logically organizes the sections of a book or an essay. Navigating
by heading can help you get a general sense of what is on a web page, as well
as aiding in quickly zeroing in on the content you want to access. I want to
know how many headings are on the page to determine whether moving by heading
is likely to be a viable navigation strategy. If I hear that there is only one
heading on the page, or there are none (which occasionally happens), I will
need to find another navigation strategy. If I hear that there are 40 or 50
headings, that too may be a problem because too many may hinder efficient
navigation. I find that somewhere in the range of five to 15 headings is best –
not too many, not too few.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hearing the number of links gives a rough indication about
how “busy” the page is. Pages like the New York Times home page can have 350 to
800 links on any given day. If you hear numbers like these, you can probably
assume that there will be lots of clutter, thus making navigation more
challenging than on pages with fewer links. </p>

<h3>7.1.1 Headings </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you have determined that heading navigation might help
you out, press H to go to the next heading and Shift H to go to the previous
one. If you navigate through all the headings on a page, this can give you a
quick general idea of what information may be accessed on that page. If you
Down arrow to read by line under the heading, you may hear a sentence or two
expanding a bit on what the heading is all about. A well -designed page will
have consistent information under each heading. As you move through the
headings, you may hear that some of them are also links, indicating that you
can press Enter to open another page on the site. Press Enter on one of these
links to open a new page. At this point, heading levels may come into play to
help you quickly find content. Web pages can have up to six heading levels.
Navigate levels by pressing the heading level number key on the number row of
your keyboard. Press one on the number row for level one headings, two for
level two headings, and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On well-designed websites, navigating to a level one heading
immediately brings you to that page’s main content: for example, the headline
of a news article. If you discover that navigating to a level one heading works
on one page, it will usually work on that site’s other pages too.</p>

<h3>7.1.2 Links</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned above, access the JAWS and Narrator Links lists
by pressing Insert F7, or via the NVDA Elements list dialog. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On many websites, links to the most important pages tend to
be clustered higher in the list. If you are exploring a site for the first
time, after going through the headings on the home page, Down arrowing through
the first 15 or 20 links in the Links list may be a good way to get a sense of
the most important pages on the site. Web developers often build these in as
main or secondary navigation regions which appear on every page of the site
(see Chapter 7.2.1 below for more on regions). For example, on many college
websites, links you often find near the top of the list include admissions,
registration, academic calendar, financial aid, faculty directory, and course
catalog. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Webpages also usually have a footer region at the bottom of
each page containing a set of links that act like a site map identifying
important links. This can be another way to better understand website
organization and available content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pressing Enter on a link activates it, redirecting you to
another page on a site, or somewhere else on that page if it’s a Same page
link. With JAWS, you can move to the next and previous link by tabbing and
Shift Tabbing, respectively. With NVDA and Narrator, you can do this by
pressing K and Shift K. However, navigation is more efficient with the Links
list. After opening it, press Home and End to go to the first and last link in
the list, respectively. You can up or Down arrow through the list. If you know
the first letter of the link, pressing that first letter until you find the
desired link is the most efficient way to navigate links. To activate a link,
press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If instead, you wish to go to the location of that link on
the current page without activating it, press Tab once and then press Enter on
the Move to link button. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In sum, for many websites, or at least for those without
major accessibility problems, using the above combination of headings and links
can give you a quick general idea of what information is available on a
website.</p>

<h3>7.1.3 Find Command for Searching text </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Often you just want to find some specific text, rather than
go on a general exploration of a web page. The Find command can save time. With
JAWS, press Control F, type in the text you want to search for, and press
Enter. You land on the first occurrence of that text after your current cursor
location. If that is not the occurrence you want, press F3 to go to the next
one. Continue pressing F3 until you find the occurrence you want. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Corresponding keystrokes for NVDA and Narrator are Control
Insert F for the first occurrence and Insert F3 for subsequent occurrences.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can be imaginative in your searches. If I am on an
Amazon page and I want to quickly find an item’s price, I will type the dollar
sign in the Find command edit box and press Enter. Or if I am looking for a
telephone number for a business and am pretty sure I know the three-digit area
code, I will type that in, and quickly find it if it is on that page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even if the text you are looking for is not present on the
page, you will immediately be told “search string not found.” This is still
better than wasting time navigating around the page. </p>

<h3>7.1.4 Form Fields</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A form field is an element that allows users to provide
input. Five types of common form fields are encountered on web pages: edit
fields, combo boxes, buttons, checkboxes, and radio buttons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS, you can access the Forms List by pressing Insert
F5. With NVDA, press Insert F7 to bring up the Elements list dialog. Shift Tab
once to the list of radio buttons, arrow up or down to the Forms radio button,
and Tab once to go to the Forms List. Narrator does not have a key command for
listing forms. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The JAWS and NVDA Forms Lists are useful for previewing how
many and what types of forms are on the page. You can arrow up or down to the
form you want, and press Enter to be placed there on the page. However, a far
better way to quickly navigate to form fields is to learn the screen reader
quick keys for the various form types. These are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>E: Edit box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>C: Combo box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>B: Button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>X: Checkbox.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A: Radio button (JAWS).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>R: Radio button (NVDA and Narrator).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>F: Form field of any kind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can press the Shift key in combination with any of the
above quick keys to go back to the previous form field of that type. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s consider each of these in turn. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Edit boxes are used for typing in text such as your name,
street address, and city of residence. Press E and Enter or Spacebar to get
into it. By default, your screen reader will make a noise of some sort to
indicate that you have entered an edit box. Another noise is heard when you
exit by pressing Escape or Enter. In JAWS, these sounds can be changed.
Alternatively, you can turn off the sounds in favor of a spoken message of “Forms
mode on” and “Forms mode off” (see Chapter 8.1.5.1 on how to do this). I will
refer to these noises as “boings” from here on. </p>

<h4>7.1.7.3 A Short Digression on Cursors </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Why press E and then Enter for entering edit boxes? It is
because you are switching cursors. Pressing the letter E is a screen reader
keystroke made using a special cursor that is part of your screen reader
program. It means nothing to a sighted person navigating the same screen. JAWS
refers to this is the “Virtual PC Cursor.” The NVDA equivalent is referred to
as “Browse mode.” Narrator calls it “Scan mode.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Pressing Enter or Spacebar to get into the edit field
changes to the PC Cursor, the same cursor that sighted people use. At this
point, both the screen reader user and the sighted user are in the same place.
Both can type in text. Escaping out of the edit field causes you to revert to a
virtual cursor. JAWS will say “Virtual PC Cursor” to indicate this. Narrator
will say “Scan mode.” NVDA just makes a sound. Thus, navigating form fields
involves switching back and forth between a special virtual screen reader
cursor and what I sometimes refer to as the “Sighted Person Cursor.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are in an edit field, pressing Tab and Shift Tab will
move you to the next and previous form field, respectively. You will not hear
any boings because tabbing and Shift tabbing keeps you in the form fields,
rather than exiting you out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By contrast, you can press the Escape key to exit an edit
field. You will hear a lower pitched boing as you exit. With JAWS, if you
remain in the default automatic forms field mode (see Chapter 8.1.5.2 for more
about this), you can also Down arrow to leave the edit field. Both will
conserve whatever text you have typed into the edit box. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Combo boxes are drop-down lists of pre-identified
selections. Lists of states and countries of residence are typical examples.
Press C and Enter or the Spacebar to get into a combo box. As with edit fields,
you will hear a boing upon entering and another boing when exiting. Arrow up or
down to make your selection. You can also first-letter navigate to your
selection. To exit out, either press Escape or Tab to the next form field.
Either of these will register your selection. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes combo boxes misbehave with screen reader programs.
As you Down arrow, the screen reader program goes silent, or the page changes
altogether. An “insurance policy” to guard against this and other misbehavior
is to press the Alt and Down arrow keys together to expand the list. Your
screen reader program will usually say “open list Box” to indicate that the
combo box is now expanded. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thus, for both edit boxes and combo boxes, a similar
two-step process is needed to switch between virtual and PC cursors. This is
not the case for the remaining types of form fields. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Buttons are most frequently used to execute an action after
some previous form fields have been filled in. Examples are OK, next, previous,
continue, submit and go buttons. Press B and Shift B to go to the next and
previous button, respectively. Press the Spacebar or Enter to activate a
button. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Press X and Shift X to go to the next and previous checkbox,
respectively. Press the Spacebar to check a checkbox, and Spacebar again to
uncheck it. It is possible to check multiple checkboxes. For example, you may
be asked which of the following ten activities are among your favorite hobbies.
In this case, you can check more than one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS, press A to go to the next radio button. With NVDA
and Narrator, press R instead. Radio buttons may be confused with checkboxes.
The important difference is that you can only check a single radio button. This
introduces a subtle difference in how to check radio buttons versus checkboxes.
Unlike checkboxes where you can press the Spacebar to check and uncheck a
checkbox, the only way to uncheck a radio button is to press the Spacebar on a
different one. For example, let’s say you are asked a question that has yes and
no radio buttons. If the Yes radio button is already checked and you Spacebar
on it, nothing happens. But if you press the Spacebar on the No radio button,
this will check it and uncheck the Yes radio button. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are in an edit field or combo box, you can press Tab
and Shift Tab to go to the next and previous form field without leaving Forms
mode.</p>

<h3>7.1.5 Tables</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tables are frequently used to display financial information
such as transactions history, investment returns, and loan product details. You
may also encounter tables on transportation sites with bus and train schedules.
From the top of the page, press T to navigate to the first table. This places
the cursor in the top left cell of the table. Your screen reader will tell you
how many columns and rows are in the table, as well as the text contained in
the cell. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are several ways to navigate within tables. Hold down
the Control, Alt and Up or Down arrow keys together to move up and down a
column. Hold down the Control, Alt and Right or Left arrow keys together to
move left or right along a row. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the web developer has designed the table with
accessibility in mind, as you navigate left and right along a row, your screen
reader program will first read the column header along the top row of the
table, and then the content of the cell where your cursor is located. As you
navigate up and down a column, your screen reader will read the row header in
the left-most column, and then the cell content. Your screen reader usually
reads column and row headers with a higher pitch than the cell content. This makes
it much easier for screen reader users to interpret cell content. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another way to move along a row, cell by cell, is to Down
arrow to move from left to right. Press the Up arrow to move from right to
left. Pressing the right and Left arrows will read character by character
within a cell. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS, you can avoid having to hold down the Control and
Alt keys by using “layered” keystrokes. With the cursor situated in a table,
hold down the Insert and Spacebar keys together until you hear a click. Then
press T and JAWS will say “table layer.” Now use just the four arrow keys to
move up, down, left, and right. You will receive the exact same audio feedback
as when holding down the Control, Alt and arrow keys, as above. Additional
keystrokes you can press in the Table layered mode are: Home and End to go to
the beginning and end cells of a row, Control Up or Down arrow to go to the top
or bottom of a column, and Control Home and Control End to go to the top left
and bottom right cells. To exit the layered mode, press the Escape key. You
will hear a chime. Also, Alt Tabbing away from the page or navigating out of
the table exits the layered mode. </p>

<h2>7.2 Other Useful Keystrokes</h2>

<h3>7.2.1 Regions/Landmarks</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Web pages may also be divided up into regions or landmarks.
JAWS uses the term “region” while NVDA and Narrator use the term “landmark.”
Press R to go to the next region with JAWS. To go to the next landmark with
NVDA and Narrator, press D.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When navigating by region or landmark, you will hear terms
like banner, navigation, and main region/landmark, among others. Down arrowing
will lead to links or text. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Currently, not that many screen reader users use
region/landmark navigation. In a 2021 WebAIM survey of assistive technology
users,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[6]</span></span></span></a>
only about one quarter of respondents said they frequently used
Regions/Landmarks. The remaining three quarters of respondents seldom or never
used them. However, that may change over the coming years as web developers
build regions/landmarks into more and more sites and do a better job of
labeling them appropriately. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Given the idiosyncrasies of web page design, there are
sometimes sites where this type of navigation is especially effective. For
example, I use TurboTax to complete my tax forms. This application does a poor
job with headings, but a good job with regions. Relevant content is located in
the main region/landmark, which is quickly accessed with the letter Q with JAWS
and Insert N with Narrator. As a result, I am able to efficiently input my tax
data using JAWS or Narrator. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As far as I know, NVDA does not currently have a quick key
for navigating to main landmarks.</p>

<h3>7.2.2 Non-Linked Text</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS and NVDA, pressing N jumps to the next block of
non-linked text: that is, text that is not links, graphics, or form fields.
This can be a good “second best” strategy when heading navigation is not
working well, the idea being that non-linked text may be meaningful text
content. I often use this to jump over repetitive elements to more quickly
access content, but it is generally not as reliable as when a page is
appropriately marked up with headings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also use N when there are repetitive elements just below a
heading, often a series of social media and other links. I press H to go to the
heading, and then N to jump closer to the content I want.</p>

<h3>7.2.3 A Few More Keystrokes</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few more keystrokes you may find useful on some web pages
are: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>G: Next graphic, especially if alt text is presented. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>L: Next list. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>K: Next placemarker (see Chapter 7.10.2 on creating
placemarkers).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>V: Next visited link.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc40000238"></a><a name="_Toc42272529">7.3 Menu </a>Structure of
the Browsers</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This section provides an overview of the menu structures of
Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You probably won’t spend lots of time in the various browser
menus, but it’s good to know your way around. Once you open a browser, the
lion’s share of your time is consumed by navigating to and browsing content.
And you can use shortcut keys to perform many common commands, rather than
navigating to them in the menus. Memorizing some of these keystrokes is well
worth the modest effort because the most frequently used ones are universal
across the browsers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Still, there will be times when you may wish to access the
menus. You may wish to change some settings, create desktop shortcuts,
bookmarks, or favorites, or perform some other function for which there is not
a shortcut key. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similar to context menus accessed via the Applications key,
Chrome and Edge also use context menus. You can Up and Down arrow through the
commands. As you do this, corresponding shortcut keys are identified. Firefox
uses classic drop-down menus rather than context menus. I’ll start with
Firefox. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As with any standard drop-down menu, open the Firefox menu
bar by pressing the Alt Key. You will first land on the File menu. Right and
Left arrow to the other menus. Particularly important ones are the Bookmarks
and Tools menus. Settings and Add-ons (the Firefox equivalent of extensions)
are found here. To access a command in any of these menus, Down or Up arrow to
the command you want to execute, and then press Enter on it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although a departure from the familiar drop-down menu
structure used in Firefox and the retired Internet Explorer, navigating the
Chrome and Edge menus is quick and easy. Once you get used to this lean and
mean menu style, you may prefer it over drop-down menus. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Google Chrome menu items are organized in a single
drop-down. Press Alt and F together to access it. Down or Up arrow to the
command you want to execute, and press Enter on it. Shortcut keys are clearly
identified as you Up and Down arrow through the menu items. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Moving down the list in the Chrome context menu, items are
as follows: New tab, New window, New incognito window, History submenu,
Downloads, Bookmarks submenu, Make text smaller, Make text larger, Full screen,
Print, Cast, Find, More tools submenu, Cut, Copy, Paste, Settings, Help
submenu, and Exit. This wraps around, so you can Up or Down arrow to the
desired command. To exit the context menu, press Escape. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Edge menu structure is very similar to that of Chrome.
As with Chrome, press Alt and F together to access the context menu. Up and
Down arrow through it and you will see that there are just a few differences.
Edge has Favorites while Chrome has Bookmarks. Yet they serve the same purpose.
Extensions are present in the list of commands in Edge’s context menu while
they are found in the More tools submenu in Chrome. </p>

<h2>7.4 Accessing Settings</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is one area of the web browser menus that are sometimes
a bit confusing. Once you figure out the process for finding the settings
categories and giving them focus, it is not hard to do, but it is not intuitive
and is subject to change. For example for a long time, once you opened the
Chrome Settings tab, the various settings categories were nicely organized by
heading. Navigation was easy and predictable. Unfortunately, the layout of the
Settings tab was changed in Fall 2021 and navigation by category required a few
contortions that I could only figure out with assistance from a sighted
colleague. So here’s how you do it in each of the browsers, but with the caveat
that it all could change in any of the browsers at any time. Consequently, I
have included the browser version numbers below. Steps may also change
depending on which screen reader you are using. Frankly, this instability and
unpredictability can be a bit maddening. </p>

<h3>7.4.1 Chrome</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for accessing Settings categories for Chrome version
96 are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt and F together, Up arrow to Settings, and press Enter. To get
there more quickly, press Alt and F together and then S. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><b><span style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:107%;
font-family:Roboto;color:#202124;letter-spacing:.2pt'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></b>This opens a Tab, just like any other web page you open as a
tab. Settings is a level one heading, and there is a level two heading for the
first Settings category which is <b><span style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:
107%;font-family:Roboto;color:#202124;letter-spacing:.2pt'>You and Google. </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You may first land in the Settings search box. If this happens, press
the Escape key to exit it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><b><span style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:107%;font-family:Roboto;
color:#202124;letter-spacing:.2pt'>To switch categories, Down arrow from the
top of the page to the category you want. These include: </span></b>you and
Google, autofill, privacy and security, appearance, search engine, default
browser, on startup, advanced, extensions, and about Chrome.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If using JAWS, press Enter on the desired category, Tab once and then
press Escape. JAWS should say “Virtual PC cursor on,” indicating that you can
now use standard web page navigation keys. Pressing Escape is not necessary
with NVDA and Narrator. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now press H to get to the associated level two heading for the category.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow through the various settings in the category. Standard form
controls (checkboxes, combo boxes, radio buttons, etc.) appear. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To change categories, return to the top of the page and repeat steps
four and five above.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When finished, press Control W or Control F4 to close the Settings tab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that the Advanced heading is collapsed, so press the
Spacebar to expand it for a list of additional settings sub-categories. These
include: Languages, Downloads, Printing, Accessibility, System, and Reset and
cleanup. </p>

<h3>7.4.2 Edge</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To access the Edge (Version 96) Settings and its various
categories with NVDA and Narrator: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='line-height:107%'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Press Alt
and F together, Up arrow to Settings, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='line-height:107%;color:#202124;
letter-spacing:.2pt'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Settings opens in a new tab. Settings is a level one heading, and
there is a level two heading for the first Edge category which is <b><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:107%;font-family:Roboto;color:#202124;
letter-spacing:.2pt'>Your profile. </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='line-height:107%'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>You may
first land in the Settings search box. If this happens, press Escape. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='line-height:107%'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To switch
categories, from the top of the page, Down arrow to the Settings menu toggle
button and press the Spacebar to expand it</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='line-height:107%'>5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b><span
style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:107%;font-family:Roboto;color:#202124;
letter-spacing:.2pt'>Down arrow through the categories which include: </span></b>profiles,
privacy and services, appearance, start new and home tabs, share copy and
paste, cookies and site permissions, default browser, downloads, family,
languages, printers, system, reset settings, phone and other devices,
accessibility, and about Microsoft Edge. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='line-height:107%'>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Arrow up
or down to the category you want to select, and press Enter on it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='line-height:107%'>7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Now press
H to get to the associated level two heading for the category.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='line-height:107%'>8.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Down
arrow through the various settings in the category. Standard form controls
appear for making changes. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='line-height:107%'>9.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Repeat
steps four through six above to switch to another category.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='line-height:107%'>10.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span>When finished, press
Control W or Control F4 to close the Settings tab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As of the writing of this book, changing Edge Settings
categories was a bit quirky with JAWS, and were as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Once in Settings, From the top of the page, Down arrow to the Settings
menu toggle button and press the Spacebar to expand the popup menu.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Settings category and press Insert Z to switch off the
JAWS Virtual PC cursor.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the desired category and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert Z again to toggle the JAWS Virtual PC cursor back on.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press H or 2 to navigate to the level two heading associated with that
category. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the setting you want to change within that category. </p>

<h3>7.4.3 Firefox</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Settings for Firefox Version 93 are accessed in the Tools
menu as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the menus, Right arrow to Tools, Down arrow to
Settings and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Hlk35413820">2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you land in a search box, press Escape to get out of it.</a></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Hlk87363948">3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With JAWS, from the top of the page, Down arrow to the Categories list
and press Enter. Note that just above the Categories list, it says
“categories.” Do not press </a>Enter on this. Down arrow through five settings
categories: general, home, search, privacy and security, and sync. Press Enter
on the category you wish to access, and then press Escape. With NVDA, go to the
top of the page and first press Insert Spacebar to turn Browse mode off. Then
press Enter on the Settings categories. Down arrow to the category you want to
select and press Enter. Press Insert Spacebar once again to be sure that Browse
mode is on. With Narrator, first press Insert Spacebar to be sure you are in
Scan mode. Then from the top of the page, Down arrow to the five categories and
press Enter on the one you want to select. Once again, press Insert Spacebar to
be sure you are still in Scan mode. With Narrator, first press Insert Spacebar
to be sure you are in Scan mode. Then from the top of the page, Down arrow to
the five categories and press Enter on the one you want to select. Once again,
press Insert Spacebar to be sure you are still in Scan mode. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press H to navigate to the first heading for that category. There are a
series of level one and level two headings for each category. Having several
level one headings makes little sense, but that’s how it is. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press H to navigate to the relevant heading. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the setting you want to modify, and use standard form
control keys to make changes. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat step three above to switch to another category.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When finished, press Control W or Control F4 to close the Settings tab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Admittedly, the ways I have described to access settings
categories for the various browsers seem to have been stuck together with duct
tape. There is nothing intuitive about them. While there may be other ways to
access the settings categories with screen readers, as of the writing of this
book, these are the ways I have been able to figure out. I hope they can
eventually become more consistent, intuitive and stable. </p>

<h2>7.5 Switching Browsers</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is easy to change your default browser, as well as to
change browsers for a particular web page where you are situated. </p>

<h3>7.5.1 Changing Your default browser</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, why ever change your default browser? Why not just
pick one browser and stick with it forever? Or only change on very rare
occasions? There are several reasons. You may like Firefox as your default, but
you open a site, and it says that the site works best with Google Chrome. If
you think you will be going back to that site frequently over the next several
hours or days, you may find it is quicker to change the default to Chrome. Or
you may be about to navigate to a “busy” web page cluttered with lots of ads,
graphics and social media links that make reading and navigation tedious and
frustrating. You may wish to switch your default browser temporarily to Edge in
order to take advantage of its Immersive reader feature (see Chapter 7.10.4.1
below). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned in Chapter 2.5.7, it is quick and easy to
switch default browsers with Windows 10. Unfortunately, this is one area where
Microsoft has taken a major step backwards with Windows 11. Procedures for
doing this with Windows 11 are more complicated and time-consuming. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To switch default browsers with Windows 10: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Windows Key to open the Start menu search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the first few letters of “Default App Settings System Settings.” As
soon as you hear these words, press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to the Web browser button. Your current default
browser will be identified here.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter or Spacebar to open a pop-up. Tab to your new default
choice, and press the Spacebar to select it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F4 to close this window (there is no OK button to activate). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned in Chapter 2, Microsoft has made the process of
changing default browsers considerably more difficult with Windows 11. I used
web browsers in Chapter 2.5.7 as an example of how to change default programs
with Windows 11. Check out that section of the book for instructions on how it
is done. </p>

<h3>7.5.2 Switching Browsers for a Specific Web page</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may want to change browsers when something seems broken
and you suspect that switching browsers may help. For example, you press Enter
on a link and nothing happens. Or the choices in a combo box don’t appear.
Switching browsers involves copying the URL from the first browser and pasting
it into the other one. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the source browser, press Alt D or F6 to go to the Address bar edit
box. The URL is already selected. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the destination browser. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If the destination browser is set to open in a new Tab (more on this in
Chapter 7.6 ), press Control V to paste the URL, and Press Enter to open it. Or
if the destination browser is set to open on a specific page, press Alt D or F6
again, press Control V to paste the URL, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that this will not work with many secure sites where
you have already logged in. The log in page will open rather than the page you
attempted to loa<a name="_Toc40000239"></a><a name="_Toc42272530">d.</a></p>

<h2>7.6 Options for Opening Web pages</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This section begins with a discussion of which page you want
to land on when you first open your browser. All three browsers give you three
options: open on a new tab page; open on the last page you were on during your
previous session; or open a specific page or set of pages. The page or pages
you choose are alternately called start or landing pages. If you pick one
specific page, it may also be referred to as a homepage. For the sake of
clarity, I will stick with the term “start page.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will first explain the concept of Tabbed browsing. Then I
will lay out the process of selecting your start page. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many people choose to make Google their Start page because
they want to be able to quickly access the Google search engine. However, if
you opt to set your start page as a new tab rather than a specific page, you
can immediately perform a search with your default search engine.
Alternatively, you can type in the site address you wish to open if you know it
already.</p>

<h3>7.6.1 Tabbed Browsing</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tabbed browsing is a form of navigation that allows a user
to browse multiple web pages in a single window. The additional pages are
denoted by tabs at the top of the browser window, hence the label “Tabbed
browsing.” Keystrokes are the same for all browsers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you have multiple web pages open, navigating to them
behaves differently than when you have multiple Word documents or multiple
Excel files open. In these latter cases, you can Alt Tab through all the open
files. However, when Alt Tabbing through your open windows, only the last web
page you opened for any given browser will open. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you use Control T to load new web pages onto tabs, rather
than Alt D or F6, you can consistently cycle through all the tabs you have
opened in a particular browser by pressing Control Tab. Close the current tab
by pressing Control W or Control F4. This will land you on one of the other web
pages opened during the current browsing session. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Besides making it easier to work with multiple web pages,
using Control T to open a new website or perform a search is quick and easy.
When you press Control T to open a new tab, if you know the address of the web
page, you can immediately type it in and press Enter, which will open the site.
Or if instead, you want to perform a search, here too, you can immediately
start typing in your search term, press Enter, and your default search engine
will generate search results. There is no need to navigate to an edit field or
the Address bar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The three screen readers do not consistently say the same
thing when opening new tabs. They will say something like “search with Google
or enter address,” indicating that you can do either of these. So, if I type in
“carroll.org” (minus the quotes) and press Enter, this will bring me directly
to the Carroll Center for the Blind website. Or, if instead, I type in the
search term “Carroll Center for the Blind,” and press Enter, this will open a
search results page using my default search engine for that browser. If my
default search engine is Google, results will appear exactly as they would if I
had already been on the google.com web page and then performed a search. </p>

<h3>7.6.2 Setting Start Pages </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To set start pages, each browser gives you three options
which are accessed through the Settings tab: a new tab, continuing where you
left off during your last session, or a specific page or set of pages. Let’s
start with Chrome. And because I noted above that accessing Settings categories
differs between screen readers, I will demonstrate just using JAWS.</p>

<h4>7.6.2.1 Chrome</h4>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt and F together to get into the Chrome context menu, Up arrow
to Settings, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you land in the search box, press the Escape key to get out of it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><b><span style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:107%;font-family:Roboto;
color:#202124;letter-spacing:.2pt'>From the top of the page, Down arrow to the </span></b>On
startup category, press Enter, Tab once, and then press Escape. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the three radio buttons. Press the Spacebar on the Radio
button of your choice. If you select either the New tab page or Continue where
you left off radio button, you are done, and can press Control W or Control F4
to close the Settings tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, continue Down arrowing to the Use current pages radio button
and press the Spacebar. If you want to choose this option, have only the
desired page or pages open when you start. While it is possible to select and
unselect among open pages, this is more complicated. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Use current pages link and press Enter</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Exit Chrome and reopen it to verify that your new Start page choice has
registered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you choose the New tab option, when you open Chrome, you
can immediately type in either a web address or a search term. Pressing Enter
will then either open the page or generate a search results page with your
default search engine. Because I like to be able to quickly access the Google
search engine, I prefer the New Tab start page option. Many people do not
choose the second Continue where you left off option because different Start
pages open from session to session. This can be confusing. Choose the third Use
current pages option if you want to always have the same Start page or pages.
Some workplaces may prefer that your browser always opens on the organization’s
website. Or you may have several pages that you open when you begin working on
your computer every day, and it is quicker to have them all appear on startup,
rather than manually reload them every time. Whichever option you choose, it is
easy to change later. </p>

<h4>7.6.2.2 Edge</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Edge Start page choices are exactly the same as those
for Chrome. Navigate to them as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt and F together to get into the Edge Menu, Up arrow to Settings
and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you land in the search box, press Escape to get out of it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To switch categories, Down arrow from the top of the page to Settings
categories. Press Enter on this to expand the list of categories. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to On startup, press Enter, and then press Escape.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press H to navigate to the On startup Heading. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the first of the radio buttons: Open the new tab page. If
this is your choice, press the Spacebar to check it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If not, Down arrow to the other two radio buttons and check the one you
want. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you choose Open a specific page or pages, as with Chrome, have only
the desired pages open to simplify the process.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Set to all currently open tabs button and press Enter.
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Exit
Edge and reopen it to verify that your start page choice has registered.</p>

<h4>7.6.2.3 Firefox </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The process for choosing startup pages for Firefox is more
complicated than for the other browsers. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Hlk35585636">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Alt Key to open the Menu bar, Right arrow to Tools, Up arrow
to Options and press Enter.</a></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you land in a search box, press Escape to exit it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From the top of the page, Down arrow to the Categories list and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on General to select that category.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow below the General heading to the Restore previous session
checkbox and press the Spacebar if you want all tabs from the previous session
to open on startup. If you do not want this, be sure to uncheck it. If you
don’t, it will override the other options discussed below.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Home to go back to the top of the page and Down arrow to
Categories and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Home category and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press C to go to the combo box, and press Enter to open it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow to your choices which include Firefox home, custom
URLs, and blank page. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>If
you choose the blank page option, press Enter and this startup option is
selected, meaning that a single new tab will open on startup </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>11.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>If
you choose Custom URLs, tab to Paste a URL where you can paste in a web
address. But if you already have the desired tabs open and only those tabs, it
is easier to tab one more time to Use current pages, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>12.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Press
Alt F4 to exit Firefox and reopen it to verify that your desired startup page

<p class=MsoNormal>To quickly go to frequently-visited websites, use favorites
and bookmarks. This saves you the time of repeatedly searching for them. If you
want to be an efficient web navigator, you will want to have a well-organized
set of favorites or bookmarks, as well as a few desktop shortcuts for the sites
you visit most frequently. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chrome and Firefox call these “bookmarks,” while Edge calls
them “favorites.” These are just different words for the same thing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because you can organize these in folders, you can have lots
of them and still easily find them. You might have quite a few bookmarks
organized in folders for finances, news, school, entertainment, and so on. By
contrast, you would not want to clutter your desktop with 40 or 50 web page
shortcuts. If you have a large number of desktop shortcuts to wade through,
this defeats the whole notion of shortcuts. Create desktop shortcuts for only
those web pages that you visit with great frequency. Think of them as your
“favorite favorites.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will not go over the processes for creating, accessing and
managing bookmarks and favorites in the various browsers. Instead, I will
present a single approach for centralizing creation and management of
favorites/bookmarks in a single folder. Doing all this in a single folder
greatly simplifies and streamlines the whole process of managing them if you
use multiple browsers. And even if you use a single browser, the process
outlined below is easier to learn and use than doing it in any of the browsers.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>First, create a new folder somewhere on your computer. This
could be in the Documents folder. However, if you use Dropbox or OneDrive,
create it in one of those places because this will back up the folder to the
cloud. Second, create a desktop shortcut for this folder (see Chapter 7.8 below
on how to do this). This will speed up the process of creating, accessing, and
managing your favorites. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for creating a favorite are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the web page you want to make a favorite, and in whatever browser you
happen to be in at the moment, press Alt D or F6 to navigate to the Address bar
where the page’s URL is already highlighted.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy the URL to the Clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Favorites folder shortcut that you have created on your
desktop. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To add the favorite to one of the subfolders here, navigate to it and
press Enter. Skip this step if you do not want to place it in a subfolder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt H W S which is the ribbon shortcut key for creating a shortcut
(I use “World Series” as my mnemonic for this). </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in an edit field. Press Control V to paste the URL here, and
then press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in the name you want to give the favorite in this second edit
field, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Managing favorites in this folder is easy because you use
the same keystrokes as when managing files and folders elsewhere on the
computer. Relevant keystrokes are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control Shift N: Create new folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Enter: Open folder.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Backspace: Go back up one folder level (Alt Left arrow and Alt Up
arrow will also work).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control C: Copy favorite.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control X: Cut favorite.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Control V: Paste favorite.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>F2: Rename folder or favorite.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Delete: Delete favorite or folder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As in your Documents folder, you can first-letter navigate
to folders and individual favorites. You can also select multiple folders and
favorites, something that is not possible when you manage them in the other
browsers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many people who have made the transition away from Internet
Explorer to one of the other browsers cite grappling with bookmarks as a big
challenge. If you adopt the above approach, you can sidestep these problems. </p>

<h2>7.8 Creating Desktop Shortcuts </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned above, create desktop shortcuts for those web
pages that you consider your “favorite favorites.” The procedure is quick and
easy for Chrome. A universal method can be used with Firefox and Edge.</p>

<h3>7.8.1 Chrome</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To create a desktop shortcut with Chrome:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the web page for which you want to make a shortcut. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt and F together, Up arrow to the More tools submenu, and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Create shortcut, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This opens an edit box pre-populated with the web page title. Edit it if
you like. When done, press Enter. The desktop shortcut is now created. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that if you create a desktop shortcut in Chrome using
the steps above, that shortcut will only open the associated web page in
Chrome, even if Edge or Firefox is your default browser.</p>

<h3>7.8.2 Universal Method for Creating Desktop Shortcuts for Web pages</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for doing this are:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>In any browser, open the webpage
for which you want to create a desktop shortcut.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt D or F6 to go to the Address bar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy the URL to the Clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Windows M or Windows D to go to the Desktop. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Spacebar to unselect any icon that may already be selected
there.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow to the New submenu, and press Enter
to open it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Shortcut and press Enter. This opens the Create shortcut
Dialog box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Type the location of the item edit box, press Control V to paste
the URL here, and then press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type a label for the shortcut in this second edit field, and press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you use this universal method to create a desktop
shortcut, the associated web page will open in your default browser.</p>

<h2>7.9 Extensions/Add-Ons</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are small software programs that customize the
browsing experience, adding more functionality for specific and limited tasks.
Chrome and Edge call them extensions, while Firefox calls them add-ons. Popular
tasks perform by extensions include blocking advertisements, enhancing
security, screen customization, and correcting grammar and spelling. Many are
available for more than one of the browsers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While there are literally thousands of extensions/add-ons
out there, don’t go overboard with them. The vast majority do little to enhance
your browsing experience,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[7]</span></span></span></a>
and many are inaccessible. Having too many running can also slow down your
computer. Some have even been reported to introduce nasty malware and viruses.
That said, there are a few extensions/add-ons that are worth considering.
AdBlock and uBlock Origin are popular extensions that block advertisements,
both for purposes of removing web page clutter and enhancing privacy. My
current Favorite is Adblock for YouTube, a Chrome extension that eliminates
irritating video ads so you can immediately listen to the content you want. <span
style='line-height:107%'>Read Aloud </span><span style='line-height:107%'>strips
away clutter on “busy” web pages” to improve readability. </span><span
style='line-height:107%'>Although this book does not deal with low vision
issues, the ZoomText smart invert Chrome extension</span> enables ZoomText and
Fusion users to use the <span style='line-height:107%'>invert brightness and
color schemes more effectively.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you know of an extension you would like to search for,
you can go to the Chrome Store or the Firefox Add-ons page. You can also simply
use your search engine to find them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For Chrome, I will use the Adblock for YouTube extension as
an example to illustrate the process of downloading and managing extensions. I
will use the uBlock Origin extension as an example for Edge, and the AdBlock
add-on as an example for Firefox. </p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'><br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<h3>7.9.1 Chrome </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To add an extension to Chrome: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Chrome, open a new tab, type “ad block for YouTube chrome store,” and
press Enter. Note that character case does not matter when typing search terms.
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press H to get to the heading for this extension.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow under the heading to the Add to Chrome button and press the
Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Add extension button and press the Spacebar. Your screen
reader will confirm that the extension has been added. It is also immediately
activated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The AdBlock for YouTube extension has one shortcoming. You
must open YouTube from inside Chrome. Getting into YouTube from a desktop
shortcut or a link in an email will not remove ads. To make it work correctly,
do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Chrome in a new tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in YouTube.com and press Enter. Note that Chrome remembers site
addresses that you frequently visit. If you go to YouTube often enough, you
will only need to type the letter Y for the full address to autofill. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In YouTube, perform a search, navigate to your choice, and activate the
link to start the video.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The video should launch immediately, minus the ads.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To manage extensions that you have downloaded to Chrome:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt and F together, and then L to go to the More tools submenu. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Extensions and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you land in the search box, press the Escape key to get out of it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press H to navigate by heading. Each of your installed extensions has a
level three heading. Underneath the heading is a Details button which you can
activate to find out more about the extension, a Remove button if you want to
delete it, and an Extension enabled toggle button. Press the Spacebar to enable
or disable the extension. </p>

<h3>7.9.2 Edge</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>To add extensions to the Edge browser:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Edge, open a new tab, type “you block origin Microsoft store,” and
press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press H until you get to the correct search result and press Enter. This
lands you on an Edge page entitled “uBlock Origin - Microsoft Edge Add-ons.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press H to navigate to the level one heading with the name of the add-ons.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Get uBlock Origin button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Add extension Button, and press Enter to confirm. Your screen
reader will say “uBlock Origin has been added to Edge.” It has also been
activated to operate immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To manage installed extensions:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt and F together to open the Edge menu, Down arrow to Extensions
and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press H to go to the Installed extensions level two heading. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the extension you want to manage. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From here, steps are exactly the same as those outlined above for Chrome
for accessing details, removing extensions, and enabling/disabling them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Press Control F4 or Control W to close the Extensions Tab
when finished.</p>

<h3>7.9.3 Firefox</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the other two browsers, simply initiating a search in a
new tab worked well. As of October 2021, this approach did not work with
Firefox. I recommend you go into the Firefox menus instead to search for an
install add-ons. Do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Menu bar, Right arrow to Tools, Down arrow to
Add-ons and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the search box, type in the name of the add-on you want to download,
and press Enter. In this example, it is “AdBlock.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press H to navigate to the AdBlock heading, which is also a link. Press
Enter to open the link.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on the Add to Firefox link.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt A to allow the download. You will receive verbal confirmation
that it has been added to Firefox. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that it is a good idea to exit Firefox after
downloading a new add-on so the Manage add-ons page loads correctly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To manage Firefox add-ons:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Menu bar, Right arrow to Tools, Down arrow to
Add-ons and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press H to navigate to the Installed add-ons heading.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Enable checkbox and press the Spacebar to enable it.
Press the Spacebar again if you want to disable it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you want to delete the add-on, Down arrow one more time to More
options and press the Spacebar to expand the list.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Remove and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To verify it is working, go to a site like <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/">CNN.com</a> that usually has several ads. With
AdBlock disabled, press the letter M to cycle through the frames (online ads
are generally contained in frames). Then enable AdBlock and repeat this. There
should be far fewer frames than before.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc42272533">7.10 Additional Useful Tools</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This section identifies several more tools to enhance your
browsing experience. They include copying and pasting hyperlinks, adding
placemarkers, tips and tricks for copying text from the web without unwanted
formatting, and using reader views to remove clutter from web pages, thus
substantially improving the reading experience.</p>

<h3>7.10.1 Copying, Pasting, and Labeling Hyperlinks</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A hyperlink is a word, phrase, or image that you can press
Enter on to jump to a new web page, document or a new section within the
current web page or document. Hyperlinks are often visually distinguished from
regular text with blue and underlined formatting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:#222222;background:white'>A </span>link
to a YouTube video is an example of a hyperlink. Let’s say you would like to
share such a link with a friend by email. You can easily copy the web page
address and paste it into a Word document or email message. You can also create
a custom label. Steps are identical in all browsers for copying, as well as for
pasting into a Word document or the body of an email message. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To copy and paste a web address into a Word document or the
body of an email message: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the web page you would like to share, press Alt D or F6 to go to the
Address bar. You will hear “http” etc. Note that the text is already selected.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy the URL to the clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to an open Word document or the body of an email message and
press Control V to paste it there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are reading this electronically with Word, below is
an unlabeled hyperlink from YouTube that you can open:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRUjr8EVgBg">https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=TRUjr8EVgBg</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want to give the hyperlink a more user-friendly label
than “http” etc., do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Word or Outlook, situate the cursor somewhere in the text of the URL.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to Edit hyperlink, and press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Text to display edit field, type in your label, and
press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here is the same hyperlink as above, but this time with a
more meaningful label:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRUjr8EVgBg">America
the Beautiful, Ray Charles</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are creating a Word document that will have numerous
links, you should do this extra labeling step. Then you can press Insert F7 to
open a links list with JAWS or Narrator (or an elements list with NVDA), and
first-letter navigate to the hyperlink you want to activate. Otherwise, you
will just have a list of links that all begin with “http,” etc., and have no
meaningful labels. </p>

<h3>7.10.2 Placemarkers </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A Placemarker is the web page equivalent of a bookmark,
enabling you to quickly navigate to that point on a web page in the future.
Using placemarkers can save you time if it requires a large number of
keystrokes to arrive at that location on the page, or the text you are looking
for is hard to find. They are particularly useful on complex websites. They can
be anchored to text, elements of the current web page, or to a website's
domain. Placemarkers can also be used in PDF documents. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can create placemarkers with both JAWS and NVDA,
although with NVDA you must first download and install an add-ons. Narrator
does not have a placemarker feature. </p>

<h4>7.10.2.1 JAWS</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>To create a placemarker using JAWS: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the first placemarker you want to create, navigate to that text on
the web page, and press Control Windows K. JAWS will say, “temporary
placemarker set.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To now turn this into a permanent placemarker, press Control Shift K.
You should land in a combo box where the first choice is stated as, “temporary
document.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Add button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in an edit box populated with the text from the web page. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to “Define for all pages on current domain,” and check this checkbox
if you want that text marked on all pages of the website. Leave it unchecked if
you are only interested in marking it on this page. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to “anchor to text,” and check this checkbox if you want specific
text to be marked. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to verify it is the correct text, but don’t modify it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter or Spacebar to save it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For any additional placemarkers you wish to create during this session,
it is not necessary to mark it first as a temporary placemarker. Instead, press
Control Shift K, and Down or Up arrow to temporary document. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Repeat
steps three through eight above to make this a permanent placemarker. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After you have added permanent placemarkers, press K and
Shift K to navigate to the next and previous placemarker, respectively. You can
also press Control Shift K to open the list of placemarkers. Then arrow up or
down to the one you want, and press Enter. In the placemarker list, you can
also first-letter navigate to the placemarker you want, and press Enter on it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As an example, open the link below:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=carroll+center+for+the+blind&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS832US832&amp;oq=carroll+center+for+the+blind&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j69i61j0l3.5681j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Google
Search - Carroll Center for the Blind</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the top of the page, if you press H for heading, it
takes quite a few keystrokes to go to the text “search results.” If you perform
lots of Google searches, this can quickly get very tedious. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now set a placemarker, anchoring it to the text “search
results.” Pressing K just once will get you to that location on the page every
time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To delete a placemarker:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift K to open the placemarker list.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow to the one you want to delete.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Remove button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is also a Remove all button here. Tab to this and
press the Spacebar if you want to remove all placemarkers for this website.</p>

<h4>7.10.2.2 NVDA</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>With NVDA, as mentioned above, you will first need to
download and install an add-ons called “Placemarkers” before you can create
them. To add and install NVDA add-ons, see Chapter 8.2.4. After installing this
add-on:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the text on the web page that you want to mark.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select some of the text at that point for labeling the placemarker. This
is not required, but a good idea if you are going to create several
placemarkers and you want to generate a list of them. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert Shift Control K to mark it. Admittedly, this is an awkward
keystroke combination, but try your best. NVDA will say “Saved position at
character” and some number. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat this process for any other placemarkers you wish to create.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Move to the next or previous placemarker with Insert K or Insert Shift
K, respectively. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can access a list of placemarkers with the keystroke
combination Insert Alt K. Up or Down arrow to a specific placemarker, and if
you Tab here, you can create a note for the placemarker. Tab a couple of times
more to delete the placemarker. You can also delete a placemarker by navigating
to it and pressing the keystroke combination Control Shift Insert Delete. </p>

<h3>7.10.3 Copying and Pasting text from the Internet </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Often when you attempt to copy and paste text from one
application to another, simply pasting with Control V will import unwanted
formatting from the original source. This is especially true when copying text
from a website. You may very well import bizarre font styles, sizes, and
colors. Using the Paste text only command can help avoid problems like this. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s say you wish to copy text from a web page and paste it
into a Word document. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select the web page text and copy it as you normally would with Control
C. Now navigate into your Word document, place the cursor where you want to
paste it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, and Down arrow to Paste options. Do not
press Enter here because this would execute a standard paste, which is what you
want to avoid.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Instead, Left arrow once to Keep text only, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pasted text now appears with the default font and
paragraph formatting of the Word document. All the unwanted formatting from the
web page has been stripped out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alternatively, use the Paste text only ribbon shortcut which
is Alt H V T.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you copy and paste text from the Internet into Word, it
often comes in with lots of unwanted blank lines between your text. You will
need to remove the coding for extra hard returns between the paragraphs. The
symbol for the hard paragraph return is ^p, the caret being the special
character above 6 in the number row on your keyboard (keystroke: Shift 6). My
mother always used to tell me to eat my peas and carrots when I was a kid, so
that is how I remember the caret P key combination. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To quickly delete the extra hard returns: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Word, press Control H. This opens the Find and replace dialog box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in the Find edit field. Type here “^p^p” minus the quotes and
with no spaces</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Replace edit field, and type in a single “^p” minus the
quotes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Replace all and press the Spacebar. You will hear the number of
replacements made. This will get rid of some of the excess hard returns, but
not necessarily all of them. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Spacebar on the OK button and immediately press Alt A to
remove more unwanted hard returns. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat the step above several times until you are down to either one or
zero replacements. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When finished, press the Escape key to exit the dialog box and return to
your document. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc27136044">7.10.4 Reader Views</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reading text on a web page that is cluttered with
advertisements, inaccessible graphics, and loads of links can be frustrating.
Switching to a reader view can cut out this clutter, resulting in a cleaner
reading experience. Safari on the iPhone has long had an excellent reader view.
PC-based web browsers have lagged until recently. Microsoft Edge and Mozilla
Firefox have built-in features called Immersive Reader and Reader View,
respectively. Chrome has a similar utility called “Reader mode ” that you need to
install first. </p>

<h4>7.10.4.1 Reader Views with Edge and Firefox</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Edge Immersive Reader and Firefox Reader View features
are very easy to </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Activate. On the page you would like to read, just press F9
in both Edge and Firefox. The press H to go the first heading, press your
screen reader Say all keystroke and listen to the text. It’s that simple. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that there is no default setting to permanently keep
these reader views on. You will need to press F9 for each web page. Also, this
functionality does not exist for all websites. However, I find it works for
most sites where I want to use it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After activating Reader mode, just below the top of the
page, there are buttons for accessing options for changing to other voices, as
well as adjusting their speed. My preference is to continue with my own screen
reader voice. </p>

<h4>7.10.4.2 Reader Mode with Chrome</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Chrome also has a Reader mode that provides the same reading
experience as the Edge and Firefox reader views. However, it is not built-in,
so you need to add it to your browser. To do this:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Chrome Address bar, type “chrome://flags” minus the quotes, and
then press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the search box on this page, type reader, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press H to navigate to the Enable Reader mode heading.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the combo box, press Enter to open it, Down arrow to
Enable, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F4 to close Chrome, and then reopen it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After Reader mode has been added, To activate it on a “busy”
web page, press F6, Tab once or twice to the Enter Reader mode button and press
Enter. To exit Reader mode on the same page, press F6 again, Tab to the Exit
Reader mode button, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, on the laptops of the people I train, it only
works about half the time. I have not been able to figure out why it works for
some people but not for others. After pressing F6 and tabbing around, the Enter
Reader mode button fails to appear. Hopefully, Google will eventually
incorporate it into Chrome and assign a simple keystroke to activate it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With all three screen readers, you can make a number of
customizations to render your computing experience smoother and more efficient.
This chapter shows how to do this for several applications with each of the
three screen reader programs. The bulk of the chapter will be devoted to JAWS
because it has the greatest variety of customization possibilities. </p>

<h2>8.1 JAWS Customizations</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most JAWS customizations are set in Quick Settings and
Settings Center. While there is significant overlap between these two areas,
the most important difference is that default changes across all applications
can only be set in SETTINGS CENTER, while QUICK SETTINGS is limited to
application-specific changes. Roughly speaking, Settings Center customizations
are more general in nature while some of those in Quick Settings are a bit more
application-specific. If this sounds rather vague and imprecise, that’s because
it is. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are a dizzying number of possible customizations, and
it can be challenging to identify the most useful ones. Keeping straight which
ones are set in Settings Center, Quick Settings, or in both makes it even more
challenging. Hopefully, in some future version of JAWS, all will be
consolidated in a single place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will first take us on a tour of the Quick Settings and
Settings Center dialog boxes, and then discuss several of the most useful JAWS
customizations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s start our tour of Quick Settings with your cursor
focus in Outlook. Press Insert V to open the Quick Settings dialog box for
Outlook. Dialog box elements are described below:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You first land in a search box where you can type in the name of
the setting you want to change. As you type individual letters, JAWS reveals
the number of search results as they narrow. Down arrow to the setting you want
to change. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>As an alternative to searching, you can Tab once to a tree view
and navigate through it to find the setting you want to change. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tab to the Read only edit field. Here you can read about the
setting you are focused on in the search results or tree view, including
options for changing the setting. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tab to a checkbox where you can expand or collapse the tree view
we encountered a couple of tabs back. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tab to the OK button to save changes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For some customizations, I prefer to use the search box, and
for others I prefer the tree view. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Settings Center dialog box closely resembles the Quick
Settings dialog box, but with one major difference. Let’s start with your focus
in a web browser window like Google Chrome. Press Insert and six on the number
row to open the Settings Center dialog box for the open browser. Settings
Center dialog box elements are described below.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Similar to Quick Settings, the first, second and third tabs are a
search box, a tree view, and a Read only help area, respectively.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The next Tab is an OK button for saving changes. Unlike Quick
Settings, no checkbox appears for expanding and collapsing the tree view. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Now comes the big difference: Tab past the OK button to a combo
box with the full list of applications. Focus will be on the program from which
you initially opened the Settings Center dialog box. Pressing the Home key will
bring you to the top of the list for making the setting a default for all
relevant programs. For example, if you open the Settings Center while in
Chrome, any changes you make will be for Chrome only. But if you Tab to this
list and press the Home key, changes will be for all applications. In this
case, this would include all browsers and PDF viewers like Adobe Acrobat
Reader.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tab one more time to wrap back to the search box where we
started.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If you wish to make a default change, from the search box, you
can also press Control Shift D rather than tabbing to the list of applications.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now some useful customizations and the most efficient way to
change them. I will assume you want to make changes for all browsers, not just
a single one. If instead, you only want to make changes for a single browser,
ignore the steps below related to making default changes in Settings Center. </p>

<h3>8.1.1 General Customizations</h3>

<h4>8.1.1.1 Punctuation Levels</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes announcement of punctuation marks (colons,
semi-colons, parentheses, etc.) can seem excessive, hindering your reading
experience. With JAWS, you can choose among four levels of spoken punctuation: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>None: This is useful for casual reading of articles on the web or
long Word documents that you are not editing yourself.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Some: A limited set of punctuation marks are spoken.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Most: This is the default. Among the most important punctuation
marks included here, but not in Some, are colons, semi-colons, parentheses, and
quotes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>All: This is useful when you are editing text.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Quick Settings, punctuation levels can be changed for
individual applications, while they can only be changed globally in Settings
Center. Most of the time, you will be interested in changing them temporarily
for a single program. Consequently, I will only cover changing them in Quick
Settings. Steps to change to None to make for a better casual reading
experience are: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the application for which you want to change punctuation levels.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert V to open Quick Settings. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the first three or four letters of the word “punctuation” in the
search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Punctuation level where the default is Most. Press the
Spacebar a couple of times to “None.” Pressing the Spacebar here cycles through
the four options.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter to make the change.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may find it useful to change punctuation levels to All
if you are proofreading a Word document or an email message. This will enable
you to hear all the punctuation. When finished with None or All, you may want
to change this setting back to Most or Some. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A shortcut key to temporarily change punctuation levels was
introduced in JAWS 2021. The keystroke is Insert Shift 2. Press this keystroke
repeatedly to cycle through the four levels. In this context, “temporary” means
that punctuation levels will revert back to the default level when you navigate
away from the current window. This is a useful feature because you are often
only interested in making a change on the fly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the Settings Center, you can customize which punctuation
marks are spoken at each level, as well as get a comprehensive list of what is
currently spoken at each level. As of the writing of this book, there were 193
punctuation marks listed. To access this list and make any changes:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting in any application, press Insert 6 to open the Settings Center.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift D to make a default change for all applications.
This is required if you access Punctuation in the Settings Center. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “punctuation” in the search box. Note that typing just the first
two or three letters is sufficient to make the full word appear. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Customize punctuation and press the Spacebar. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow through the list to hear each punctuation mark and the
current level at which it is spoken.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To change the level where a particular punctuation mark is spoken, press
the Spacebar to cycle through the four choices. Stop when you get to your
choice. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the next punctuation mark for which you want to change the
level at which it is spoken, and repeat the previous step. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When finished making your changes, Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<h4>8.1.1.2 Typing Echo <a name="OLE_LINK6"></a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Typing echo is the audio feedback that is “echoed” back to
you when you type text. It can be changed in both Settings Center and Quick
Settings. There are four options:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Characters: You hear each character as you type. This is the
default.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Words: You hear no characters, but only hear a full word after
you have finished typing it and either press the Spacebar or a punctuation key
like a period or comma.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Both characters and words: You hear individual characters as you
type, as well as the entire word after you press the Spacebar or a punctuation
key.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>None: JAWS remains silent as you type. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Character echo is the default factory setting. Typing echo
can also be temporarily changed by pressing insert 2 on the number row and
toggling through the four choices. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will only cover changing the default in Settings Center.
Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting in any application, press Insert 6 to open the Settings Center.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift D to make a default change for all applications. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “echo” in the search box, minus the quotes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Typing echo where the default is Characters. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Spacebar several times to cycle through the choices, and stop
on your choice. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<h4>8.1.1.3 Detect Languages </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>JAWS sometimes starts reading text with foreign language
pronunciation, making it incomprehensible. You can turn this off in either
Settings Center or Quick Settings. I will do it in Quick Settings. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert V to open Quick Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the search box, type in the first few letters of “language.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Language detection checkbox and press the Spacebar to
uncheck it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Text should now read normally in your default language.</p>

<h4>8.1.1.4 Speak Dollars </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>When turned on, numbers preceded by a dollar sign are read using
the dollars and cents format. For example, “dollar three point nine five” will
be read as “three dollars and ninety five cents,” thus making it sound more
like when spoken aloud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Change this in Settings Center as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting in any application, press Insert 6 to open the Settings Center.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift D to make a default change for all applications.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “the first few letters of “dollar” in the search box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Speak dollars checkbox and press the Spacebar to check
it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<h4>8.1.1.5 Number Processing </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can change how JAWS reads numbers. Altering this can
make reading more comprehensible depending on whether it is a phone number,
serial number, code of some sort, or just a big number. Choices are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Controlled by synthesizer: Leaves it up to JAWS to figure out how
numbers are read. This is the default. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Single digits: Reads numbers as a series of single numbers. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Pairs: Reads numbers as a series of paired numbers. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Full numbers: Reads numbers as complete numbers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To change this setting:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert 6 to open Settings Center.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the first few letters of “number processing” in the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Number processing and press the Spacebar to cycle to your
choice.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<h4>8.1.1.6 Disabling and Enabling the JAWS Voice Assistant </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Beginning with JAWS 2021, the Voice Assistant allows speech
input for executing selected JAWS commands. It can be initiated by voice or a
keystroke combination. To initiate it by voice, say “Hey Sharky.” You will then
hear a short noise, after which you concisely speak the command. The same short
noise will repeat, indicating that the command has been executed. You can also
enable it with the keystroke combination Insert Alt Spacebar, all held down
together. You will hear the same noises as when you initiate it by voice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Voice Assistant is enabled by default. On occasion, you
may start it by mistake. If you want to disable it, do the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting in any application, press Insert 6 to open the Settings Center.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift D to make a default change for all applications.
Note that this cannot be done for individual applications. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “voice ” in the search box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Enable Voice Assistant checkbox and press the Spacebar
to uncheck it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In these search results, if you Down arrow one more time,
there is an Enable Voice Assistant sounds checkbox. You can enable the Voice
Assistant and disable sounds if you only wanted to use the Insert Alt Spacebar
key combination to enable it. If I were in an office setting, I might be a bit
embarrassed to have colleagues hear me say “Hey Sharky” periodically through
the day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To reenable the Voice Assistant, just repeat the steps
above, this time checking the checkboxes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Provided you are running JAWS 2021 or later, to learn more
about the array of JAWS keystrokes that can be invoked using the Voice
Assistant, visit Chapter 1.2.2.2 on how to access JAWS Help topics. On either
the Contents page tree view or on the Search page, you can find information
about using the Voice Assistant. Several tables with available voice commands
are presented on that page. This list is expected to expand as this feature is
further developed. Just a few examples of voice commands you can speak are
Links list, Settings Center, and Quick Settings.</p>

<h3>8.1.2 Word Customizations </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>While all of the customizations described so far in this
chapter are relevant for multiple applications, including Word, the
customizations in this next section tend to be more applicable to Word than to
other applications.</p>

<h4>8.1.2.1 Comments, Footnotes, and Endnotes Detection</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you navigate through a Word document, JAWS can announce
when it encounters a comment, footnote, or endnote. To access the various
options:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert V to open Quick Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the search box, type the first few letters of “comments, footnotes,
and endnotes detection.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Comments, footnotes, and endnotes detection checkbox
and press the Spacebar to cycle through the four choices, which are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On:
Comments, footnotes, and endnotes are announced as you navigate through the
document. This is the default.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Off:
Comments, footnotes, and endnotes are not announced. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
+ Count: The number of Comments, footnotes, and endnotes on the current line is
announced.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:1.0in'><span style='font-family:
"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
with Text: Choose this option if you want to hear the full text of comments,
footnotes and endnotes as you navigate through the document.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After making your selection, Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is important to note that comments, footnotes, and
endnotes are not actually located at the place where they are referenced as you
navigate through the document. You will need to access them using the related
commands in the References tab of the Word ribbons. </p>

<h4>8.1.2.2 Outline Level Indication</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option controls whether to indicate outline levels
while reading through a Word document or Outlook message. For example, when you
encounter bulleted and numbered lists, JAWS says “level one.” JAWS says “level
zero” when you navigate past the list and return to normal paragraph style.
This setting is turned on by default. Many people prefer to switch off this
verbosity. Yet it can be helpful in situations where you have several levels
present in bulleted and numbered lists. This setting can only be changed in
Quick Settings. From Word or Outlook steps for switching it off are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert V to open Quick Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “outline” in the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow once to the Outline level indication checkbox and press the
Spacebar to uncheck it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Try this out with your cursor situated in one of the many
numbered or bulleted lists in this book. </p>

<h4>8.1.2.3 Indentation</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option controls whether or not JAWS indicates the
presence of indentation as you navigate through a document. When proofreading,
this can be useful to be sure you have not accidentally added tabs or spaces.
It can be changed in both Settings Center and Quick Settings. Most of the time,
you will want to do this for Word only, so we will use Word in Quick Settings
as an example. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in Word, press Insert V to open Quick Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “indent” in the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow once to Indentation. The default setting is Ignore.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Spacebar once to select Indicate.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a change in indentation occurs, you will hear things
like:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>“Two spaces,” indicating the location of a bullet or number at
the beginning of the first line of a hanging indent of one-quarter inch.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>“Five spaces,” indicating the location of the first character in
the second line of a hanging indent of one-half inch.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Left margin,” indicating that you have returned to non-indented
text aligned with the left margin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To hear JAWS express the cursor position more precisely in
inches, press the Alt and Delete keys together. You will hear the position of
the cursor relative to the left and top edges of the page, as well as the page
number. For example, you may hear “PC cursor active, one inch from left, 2.9
inches from top, page three.” If your page has normal margins of one-inch, this
indicates that your current cursor position is flush with the left margin, and
1.9 inches from where text begins at the top of the page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When finished proofreading, repeat the steps above to
restore the Ignore setting. </p>

<h4>8.1.2.4 Indicate Capitalization</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>When proofreading a document, temporarily changing this in
either Settings Center or Quick Settings can be useful for checking for correct
capitalization. The presence of capitalization will be indicated by a higher
pitch voice than for lower case letters. I will describe steps using Quick
Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To have capitalization indicated in Say all mode:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert V to open Quick Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the first few letters of “capitalization” in the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow once to Capitalization, where it will say “ignore” if still
in default mode.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Spacebar once for it to say “indicate.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press the Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When finished proofreading, repeat the above steps to return
to ignore when in Say all reading mode. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also be more granular in how you have capitalization
indicated. There are four options:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>On character: This indicates capital letters only when reading by
character and when spelling. This is the default.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Never: Select this if you do not want JAWS to indicate capital
letters. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>On word and character: JAWS indicates capital letters when
reading by word or character, and when spelling. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>On line, word, and character: JAWS indicates capital letters when
reading by line, paragraph, word, and character, and when spelling. This is the
best choice for proofreading. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for changing this setting for the current application
are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert V to open Quick Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the first few letters of “capitalization” in the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Indicate capitalization and press the Spacebar to cycle to
your choice.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here too, when finished proofreading, you will want to
change back to the default setting of indicating capitalization by character
only, because the preferred proofreading setting can be very distracting.</p>

<h3>8.1.3 Outlook Customizations </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you open Outlook messages, there may be a great deal of
verbosity that you may find distracting. Default settings were switched in a
recent version of JAWS (either 2020 or 2021), so this excess verbosity may no
longer be the default on your computer. Useful changes you can make in Quick
Settings are. </p>

<h4>8.1.3.1 Reading Options</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even though you have already heard in the Inbox the name of
the sender, the subject, and various other things for a given message, you may
hear much of this information repeated when you open it. You can reduce this
verbosity, as well as have the message automatically start reading by doing the
following: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in Outlook, press Insert V to open Quick Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the tree view.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Reading options and press the Right arrow to open level 1
of the tree view if it is not open already.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Message header field with message announcement
checkbox and press the Spacebar to uncheck it. You will no longer hear the name
of the sender and message subject repeated. This will greatly reduce message
reading verbosity.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Message type announcement and uncheck it if you don’t
want to hear indication of whether the message is in HTML or text format.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Link count announcement checkbox and uncheck it if you
don’t want to hear how many links are contained in the body of a message.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Messages automatically read checkbox and check it so
that messages will automatically read continuously when you open them. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now open a message and hear the difference. </p>

<h4>8.1.3.2 Layout Tables </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>These are tables used exclusively for formatting purposes.
You can choose to ignore them or hear information about them (numbers of
columns and rows). In many cases, this only introduces excess verbosity and
does nothing to improve navigation effectiveness. You change this customization
in Quick Settings. Layout tables are often present in Outlook messages, and I
prefer to ignore them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To access this customization in Outlook’s Quick Settings,
you must first be in a window for an existing message, rather than in one that
you are currently preparing. Otherwise, this option will not appear in Quick
Settings. Logically speaking, just changing the setting so JAWS ignores layout
tables should work. Yet I find that it is necessary to turn off all relevant
table reading settings. To do this: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open an existing Outlook message, preferably one with lots of
unnecessary table-related verbosity. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert V to open Quick Settings, and type “table” in the search
box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Layout table ignore checkbox and press the Spacebar to
check it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Automatic table titles, and press the Spacebar until it
says, “off.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To verify, if you are not already in a message that previously had lots
of unwanted table-related verbosity, open one now to see if it has been
removed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Keep in mind that changing these settings will remove table
detection for all messages, including those where you might want table
formatting information to be read. In such cases, return to Quick Settings and
switch back the above settings. I prefer to leave table reading off because
table formatting that is actually useful is relatively rare in outlook messages,
or at least in the ones I receive. </p>

<h3>8.1.4 Excel Customizations</h3>

<h4>8.1.4.1 Cell Text Visibility Detection </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Turning this on alerts you that cell content is partially
hidden to sighted users, or “cropped.” You will then either have to reduce the
number of characters in the cell or increase column width to accommodate the
entire content of the cell. See Chapter 5.8.1 on adjusting column width. This
is turned off by default. Steps for turning on cell visibility detection are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From inside the Excel file for which you want to change this setting,
press Insert V to open Quick Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the first few letters of “cell text visibility” in the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Cell text visibility detection checkbox and press the
Spacebar to turn it on.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If, for example, you are in cell A5 and there is a text
visibility problem, JAWS will announce “cropped right at B5,” indicating that
text in cell B5 is partially hiding the text in cell A5. If the text in cell A5
spills over into cell B5, but there is nothing there to crop the text in cell
A5, JAWS will say, “overlaps right near B5,” or whichever is the right-most
cell A5’s text extends to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you now save this file, cell text visibility detection
remains on only for this file. You cannot make this the default. You must do it
for each file individually. Moreover, as of the writing of this book using JAWS
2021, this setting is inconsistent, and it has been this way with several
earlier versions. Often, even after increasing column width the correct amount,
JAWS still announces that the cells are cropped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NVDA does a better job on this, always announcing the
presence of cropping. In my opinion, announcing cropping should be the default
for JAWS. Otherwise, most JAWS users will not even know there is a problem
because JAWS announces all cell content, regardless of whether it is fully
visible or not. Also, once column width is adjusted, NVDA reliably indicates
that the problem no longer exists. For these reasons, I prefer using NVDA
rather than JAWS when column widths may need to be adjusted due to cell text visibility
issues.</p>

<h4>8.1.4.2 Cell Verbosity </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This option controls whether to announce both cell content
and coordinates (that is, cell addresses) or only cell content as you navigate
through a spreadsheet. The default setting is to announce both cell content and
coordinates. Most of the time you will want full verbosity. However, once you
are thoroughly familiar with a particular spreadsheet or are concentrating on
data entry, turning off cell coordinates can be a good option, at least
temporarily. To change this setting:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Excel, press Insert V to open Quick Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the first few letters of “cell verbosity” in the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to this setting which is set as “content plus coordinates” by
default. Press the Spacebar once to switch to “content only.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As with cell text visibility, this cannot be changed to the
default, but must be changed for each individual file.</p>

<h4>8.1.4.3 Monitor Cells</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>As discussed in Chapter 8.1.4.3, you can designate up to ten
monitor cells or data ranges to enable quick navigation to important areas of
your worksheets. In that section, I identified shortcut keys for assigning,
reassigning, and navigating to monitor cells. Alternatively, You can assign and
reassign monitor cells in Quick Settings, but this is a bit slower. If you wish
to remove individual monitor cell assignments, or clear all of them at once,
you must do this in Quick Settings. In this section, I will cover how to
perform all of these actions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To assign monitor cells in Quick Settings:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor on the cell that you want to assign. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press INSERT V to open the Quick Settings dialog box, and type
&quot;monitor&quot; without the quotes in the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>DOWN ARROW to the Monitor cell 1 unassigned checkbox (assuming that is
the one you want to assign), and press the Spacebar to check it. You will hear
that it is assigned to the cell you have designated.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To reassign a monitor cell, navigate to the new cell you
want to designate as the new monitor cell and repeat the above steps. To clear
an individual monitor cell assignment, repeat the above steps to navigate to
the monitor cell you want to clear, and press the Spacebar. JAWS will indicate
that this monitor cell is now unassigned. And finally, to clear all monitor
cell assignments:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press INSERT V to open the Quick Settings dialog box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type &quot;monitor&quot; without the quotes. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>DOWN ARROW to the Clear checkbox and press the Spacebar to check it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<h4><a name="_Hlk68691590">8.1.4.4 </a>Comments Announcement</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you use comments or notes in Excel (see Chapter 5.9.2),
you can use this option to indicate whether a cell has an associated comment.
The default setting is On. To access this setting:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in Excel, press Insert V to open Quick Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<h3>8.1.5 Web Browsing Customizations</h3>

<h4>8.1.5.1 Forms Fields Entry/Exit Notification Sounds </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>By default, when you Enter an edit box or combo box, JAWS
makes a sound. JAWS refers to the initial default sounds as “boings.” When you
exit an edit field or combo box, JAWS makes a slightly lower pitch boing. For
some people, including me, the difference between the two boings is a bit too
subtle. I have reset the exit sound with a camera shutter, which is more
distinguishable than the initial boing to me. In addition, you can turn the
Forms mode entry and exit sounds off. If you do this, when you Enter and exit,
JAWS will say “Forms mode on” and “Forms mode off,” respectively. Steps for
changing these sounds are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting in one of the browsers, press Insert 6 to open the Settings
Center for that browser.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift D if you want to make changes for all web browsers.
This will also include forms in PDF viewers like Acrobat Reader. Skip this step
if you want to make changes for only the browser you are in. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the tree view, Down arrow to Forms mode, and Right arrow to
expand the tree view.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Enable sound notifications checkbox and press the
Spacebar to uncheck this if you would rather hear JAWS say “Forms mode on/off”
than hear sounds. Then Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, if you want to hear sounds, Down arrow to Select sound for
leaving Forms mode, and press the Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow or first-letter navigate to the sound you want to select. For
example, press C for camera shutter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Either press Alt P, or Tab once and press the Spacebar to hear a sample
of this sound. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button to accept.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>9.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to a second OK button to save the change and exit Settings Center. </p>

<h4>8.1.5.2 Forms mode Customization</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can choose among three ways to enter and exit Forms
mode: auto, semi auto and manual. Auto is the default. Semi-auto and manual are
generally more appropriate for experienced users.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It can be useful to know how to change between these modes
because of requirements of different applications. One example is Google Drive,
where files and folders used in the Google Suite applications are managed and
stored. You must change to manual to make Google Drive accessible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When set to auto mode, JAWS automatically enters Forms mode
when you press Tab, Shift Tab, or the Up and Down arrow keys to move to an edit
field. To indicate you have entered Forms mode for edit fields and combo boxes,
you will hear a boing. When finished with the edit field or combo box, you can
press ESC to exit Forms mode. With edit fields, you can also press UP or DOWN
ARROW to exit Forms mode. You will hear a lower pitch boing when exiting edit
fields and combo boxes. This assumes you have not disabled Forms entry/exit
sound notifications discussed in the previous section.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Choosing manual prevents JAWS from automatically placing you
in Forms mode as you navigate using any of the commands including the Tab Key.
When you move into an edit field or combo box, you must press ENTER first to
type text or select a combo box choice. To manually exit Forms mode, press the
Escape key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Semi-auto is a hybrid of auto and manual. You will only
enter Forms mode if you land on a control while navigating with Tab or Shift
Tab. Forms mode will not be activated if you navigate with the ARROW keys or
navigation quick keys. You must manually exit Forms mode when semi-auto is
active. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To access and change Forms mode options:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting in one of the browsers, press Insert 6 to open the Settings
Center for that browser.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift D if you want to make changes for all applications.
Skip this step if you want to make changes for just that one browser. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the tree view, Down arrow to Forms mode, and Right arrow to
expand this level of the tree view.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow once to Select Forms mode, and press the Spacebar to cycle
between the three choices: auto, semi-auto and manual. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After making your choice, Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<h4><a name="_Hlk62903838">8.1.5.</a>3 Automatic Web page Reading</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>By default, when you open web pages, JAWS begins to read
continuously from the top of the page. This creates excess verbosity. You wind
up constantly hitting the Control key to stop the computer from yapping. This
can be turned off as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting in one of the browsers, press Insert 6 to open Settings Center
for that browser.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift D to make a default change for all applications.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Start typing the word “document” in the search box. You will only need
to type the first two or three letters for the full search term to autofill.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Document and web pages automatically read when loaded
checkbox, and press the Spacebar to uncheck this.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and Press the spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a web page loads, JAWS will now tell you the page title
and the number of regions, headings and links on the page, and then stop
speaking. This is useful information to have, and it is nice that this is all
you hear before JAWS stops talking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that if you make this a setting for all applications,
it will also operate when opening PDF files with a PDF viewer like Adobe
Acrobat DC. Instead of reading continuously, JAWS will be silent. You will need
to use standard reading keystrokes to start reading the PDF.</p>

<h4>8.1.5.4 Say All Scheme </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>When reading text on the web, sometimes constant
interruptions with announcements of links and headings becomes annoying.
Wikipedia articles are good examples. There may be as many as 5 or more links
in a single sentence, making it hard to concentrate on hearing the text. You
can turn off heading and link announcement in Say all mode so that you can
focus on listening to the text only. You can still hear headings and links
announcements when not in Say all mode. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting in one of the browsers, press Insert 6 to open Settings Center
for that browser.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift D to make a default change for all applications. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “scheme” in the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Select scheme where the default is no change. Press the
Spacebar until you hear “say all text only.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter to make the change.</p>

<h4>8.1.5.5 Audio Ducking </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enabling Audio ducking is useful when listening to audio
that can compete with the JAWS voice. Listening to music or a video in YouTube
is a good example. Or if I am stuck in an especially boring Zoom meeting and
want to check my emails, I am thankful that Audio ducking exists. With Audio
ducking enabled, audio volume from other programs is temporarily lowered (or
“ducked”) while JAWS speaks, allowing you to more easily hear the JAWS voice
which remains at full volume. Audio-ducking can only be set for all programs.
Steps for enabling Audio ducking are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting in any application press Insert 6 to open the Settings Center.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift D to make a default change for all applications. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type either “audio” or “volume” in the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Lower audio volume of programs while JAWS speaks
checkbox, and press the Spacebar to check it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To temporarily enable or disable Audio ducking, press Insert
and the Spacebar together, followed by D to toggle Audio ducking on and off.
While it is possible to turn Audio ducking off, I cannot think of any reason
why a JAWS user would ever want to disable it. </p>

<h4>8.1.5.6 Inline Frames Reading </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inline frames are most commonly used to display
advertisements. In such situations, JAWS may read what appears to sound like
gibberish to a non-sighted screen reader user. Turning off the reading of
frames can clean up web page clutter, thus facilitating a smoother browsing
experience. To be sure it works, first navigate to a web page with ads. CNN.com
is a good place to try it out because this site usually displays several ads.
Press M which is the JAWS quick key to navigate to the next frame, or Insert F9
which displays a list of frames and tells you how many are present on the page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for changing this setting are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Starting in one of the browsers, press Insert 6 to open the Settings
Center for that browser.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift D to make a default change for all applications if
this is what you want to do. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “frame” in the search box.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Ignore inline frames checkbox, and press the Spacebar
to check it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Back on the web page you are testing, press M again. JAWS should say
“there are no frames on this page,” indicating that they are no longer
detected.</p>

<h2>8.2 NVDA Customizations </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some of the customizations listed above for JAWS are
possible with NVDA. They are accessed in the Document Formatting, Speech
Settings and Browse mode dialog boxes in the NVDA menus. Only global
customizations can be made, not application-specific ones. Add-ons can also be
downloaded and installed to extend NVDA functionality. </p>

<h3>8.2.1 Customizations in the Document Formatting Dialog </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can change which elements are detected when navigating
the web. To access the Document Formatting dialog box, you can either use the
shortcut Insert Control D, or go in via the NVDA menus. To access this dialog
box through the menus:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the NVDA menus by pressing Insert N. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Preferences submenu and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to or first-letter navigate to Document Formatting. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab to move through the choices which are organized in groups.
Press the Spacebar to check or uncheck your choices. Relevant settings for web
browsing are contained in the Elements Group, and include headings, links,
graphics, lists, block quotes, landmarks, frames, and a few more.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of the time, you will want these elements to remain
checked (the default), especially headings and links. Unlike with JAWS where
reading of these elements is only turned off in Say all mode, when you uncheck
them in NVDA, they are no longer detected in any reading mode. </p>

<h3>8.2.2 Customizations in the Speech Settings Dialog Box</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Punctuation levels can be altered here, and Audio ducking
can be enabled and disabled. NVDA punctuation levels are identical to those for
JAWS (none, some, most, and all). The default is some. To change punctuation
levels:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the NVDA menus by pressing Insert N. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Preferences submenu and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow or first-letter navigate to Speech. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Punctuation level combo box, and Up or Down arrow to your
choice.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NVDA has three Audio ducking choices: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>No ducking: Disables Audio ducking.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Duck when outputting speech and sounds: NVDA lowers the volume of
other audio when NVDA is speaking or playing sounds. This may not work for all
synthesizers.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Always duck: The volume of other audio will remain lower the
whole time NVDA is running.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To change Audio ducking settings:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the NVDA menus by pressing Insert N. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Preferences submenu and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow or first-letter navigate to Speech. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Change button and press the Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Audio ducking combo box and Up or Down arrow to your choice. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to a second OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Audio ducking can be temporarily changed using the Insert
Shift D key combination. </p>

<h3>8.2.3 Customizations in the Browse Mode Dialog Box</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this dialog box, you can turn sounds off for entering and
exiting form fields. You can also stop NVDA from automatically reading a web
page when it is loaded. To access this dialog box and change these settings, do
the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the NVDA menus by pressing Insert N. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Preferences submenu and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to or first-letter navigate to Browse mode. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Automatic say all and press the Spacebar to uncheck it if you
don’t want web pages to be automatically read when loaded.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Audio indication of focus in Browse mode and press the Spacebar
to uncheck it if you don’t want to hear sounds when entering and exiting form
fields. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press the Spacebar to save your changes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you turn off the Automatic say all setting, when you load
a new page, NVDA will tell you the web page title, and then say “clickable” and
the label of the first link on the page. It will then stop speaking. If you
turn off Audio indication of Browse mode, instead of hearing noises when
entering and exiting form fields, NVDA will say, “Focus mode” when entering form
fields and “Browse mode” when exiting them.</p>

<h3>8.2.4 NVDA Add-Ons</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>NVDA has a large number of add-ons for extending its
functionality. These can be download at the <a
href="https://addons.nvda-project.org/index.en.html">NVDA Community Add-ons
website</a>, a page easily navigated using headings. As of the writing of this
book, there were almost one hundred add-ons available on this page. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To find information on an add-ons and download it to your

creating placemarkers on web pages with NVDA.</p>

<h2>8.3 Narrator Customizations</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The array of Narrator customizations are more limited, but
there are still a number of useful ones. Several of them can be quickly and
easily activated with shortcut keys. </p>

<h3>8.3.1 Verbosity Levels</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can change verbosity levels for indicating formatting
and punctuation. Verbosity levels for text reading including formatting, can be
changed in the Narrator Settings menu or with a shortcut key. Change them in
the menus as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Windows N to open Narrator Settings. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Change the level of detail Narrator provides about text and
controls combo box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up and Down arrow through the five options, ranging from text only to
all text details. Press Enter on text only to select the least encumbered
reading experience, or press Enter on All text details when proofreading
document formatting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Alternatively, you can use the shortcut key Insert V to
cycle between these choices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can change the amount of punctuation verbosity that
Narrator reveals by pressing Insert Alt Plus or minus on the number pad.
Verbosity levels are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Default: Reveals little to no punctuation. Natural pauses will

9 Tools for Proofreading and Review</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk76732871">All three screen reader programs have
useful tools for proofreading text. This chapter will begin by discussing spellchecking,
the most important tool for correcting typing mistakes and some grammatical
errors. In Chapter 3.5, I covered styles. Using styles for font and paragraph
formatting will ensure more consistent document formatting. Using the
proofreading tools in this chapter will further ensure you are formatting
documents consistently and correctly. </a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The JAWS Text Analyzer utility is used primarily for
correcting punctuation mistakes, although it can also be used for detecting
font formatting inconsistencies. The JAWS Speech and Sounds Schemes tool is a
powerful way to detect font formatting errors. The NVDA Document Formatting and
Narrator Verbosity utilities detect a wide array of format settings. They are
easy to use and will detect numerous errors that you otherwise might have
failed to detect. If you consistently use these tools, in combination with
spellcheck and styles, you will cut down substantially on typing, punctuation,
and formatting errors. Your documents and email messages will have a more
professional look. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of the tools covered in this chapter can be used for
both proofing Word documents and Outlook messages. That said, I vastly prefer
doing the bulk of text composition and formatting in Word. If I want to prepare
an Outlook message longer than two or three sentences in length, it is more
efficient and reliable to first prepare the text in Word. Once finalized, I
then select and copy the text from Word and paste it into the body of an email
message. Experience has taught me that too many things can go wrong when
preparing and formatting text in an Outlook message. First, your unfinished
message can disappear without you ever knowing why, forcing you to start over.
Second, I mentioned in Chapter 4.8.1 that the Outlook Drafts folder is
dysfunctional with Gmail accounts, my own included. I have little confidence
that when a message contained in this folder is ready to go that I will be able
to send it off smoothly. I avoid saving unfinished messages to the Drafts
folder whenever possible. Instead, I save the text as a Word file until ready
to copy and paste it into an Outlook message. Third, as of the writing of this
book, all versions of Outlook use the older 2013/2016 Word Spellcheck utility.
I prefer the newer 365/2019 version, so like to spellcheck in Word rather than
Outlook. And finally, even though default fonts are identical between Word and
Outlook (Calibri 11 point), a single line of text in an email message is much
longer than in a Word document. To test this, I copied and pasted the beginning
lines of this paragraph into a blank Word document and the body of an email
message. The first line of the email message contained 47 words while only 17
words were contained in the first line of the Word document. This makes text
editing more time-consuming in Outlook because of the longer distance needed to
navigate within message lines to get to the text to be edited. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you will see below, the PowerPoint Spellcheck utility
works very poorly. Here too, I prefer to do the bulk of my PowerPoint editing
in Word first, and then copy and paste the text into PowerPoint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other people often review documents that you prepare. This
is of course a central role for teachers. You may also collaborate on documents
with co-workers on a team. Word has two useful tools for use in these contexts.
Comments can be electronically inserted into documents by reviewers. You will
need to know how to access and delete them, as well as how to prepare comments
yourself. Teachers or collaborators may also suggest specific text changes. The
Track Changes (also known as Revisions) tool enables you to detect these
editing suggestions, as well as accept or reject them. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc1629863">9.1 Spellchecking</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spellcheck your work early and often to correct typos. Keep
in mind that when a sighted person sends out a document with lots of typing
errors, other sighted people think it’s just because that person is sloppy.
When a visually impaired person does this, some sighted folks will take pity,
assuming that because he or she is blind they just can’t do any better. Prove
them wrong!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will first discuss spellchecking Word documents and
Outlook messages, the two applications where you will presumably do the bulk of
your spellchecking. I will then discuss spellchecking Excel spreadsheets and
PowerPoint presentations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Spellcheck utility has evolved over the years. One
interesting challenge is that the Spellcheck dialogs differ between the Office
programs, even for Office 365. Word uses the version that came with Word 2019,
Outlook and PowerPoint use the 2016 version, and Excel uses the 2010 version.
Hopefully sometime soon, Microsoft will make all Office Suite applications
consistent, using the 2019 version, the one I consider best.</p>

<h3>9.1.1 Spellchecking in Word and Outlook</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are several versions of Spellcheck for Word: a
2013/2016 version and a 365/2019 version. As of the writing of this book,
Outlook uses just the older 2013/2016 version used by Word.</p>

<h4>9.1.1.1 2013 and 2016 Spellcheck in Word and Outlook</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>To start spellchecking, press F7. If you are not sure
whether you have the old or new version, the first time you Press F7, if you
have the older version, you will land on the Ignore button in the Spellcheck
dialog box. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you start Spellcheck with F7, Word jumps to the first
word or grammatical construction that it thinks is misspelled or incorrect. It
will first read the misspelled word, letter by letter, and then the suggested
correct spelling, letter by letter. If Spellcheck thinks it has encountered a
grammatical error, it will explain the error and suggest a change. One example
is extra spaces between words. As mentioned above, the first time you Press F7
while spellchecking, you will land on the Ignore button. For all subsequent
times, you will land on the button you previously hit. In other words, you will
land in different places in the dialog box while spellchecking. Therefore, it’s
a good idea to know the order in which the buttons appear in the dialog box. Here’s
a list of the buttons you can move through with Tab and Shift Tab in their
correct order, their corresponding shortcut keys, and what they do.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Change (C): Accept suggested correct spelling.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Change All (L): Accept suggested correct spelling for all
occurrences of this misspelled word in this document.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Ignore (I): Ignore suggested spelling change and retain current
spelling.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Ignore All (G): Ignore suggested spelling change for all
occurrences of this spelling in this document.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add (A): Add this word to the permanent dictionary.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Change combo box: List of suggested spelling changes. Down arrow
to move to the correct option, Tab once to the Change button, and press the
Spacebar to accept. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the dialog box, you have the option of pressing Tab to
get to the button you wish to select and pressing the Spacebar to activate it.
Or you can press the shortcut key for that button, provided that your cursor is
not already situated on that button. That’s the theory. In practice, the first
option often works more cleanly than using the shortcut key. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inevitably, you will encounter glitches. Here are a few
common ones and their potential solutions:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The screen reader fails to read the incorrect and suggested
correct spelling. With JAWS, you can press Insert F7 and JAWS will hopefully
say it this time. This does not work with NVDA or Narrator. With these screen
readers, press Escape to get out of The Spellcheck, and press F7 to get back
in. Hopefully, you will hear the information this second time. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>No spelling suggestions are given. Press Escape to get out of
Spellcheck. Your cursor will be situated on the line with the supposed spelling
or grammatical error. Read through it and make the correction manually. If you
Escape to get out of Spellcheck, your previous corrections are not lost. When
you Press F7 to resume spellchecking, you will come back into it right where
you left off. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>While not a glitch, sometimes you don’t have enough context to
know if you should accept the suggested spelling change. With JAWS, press
Insert C (for context) and JAWS will read the full line where the word is
located. This should help you make the right choice. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alternatively, with any of the screen readers, press Escape to
get out of Spellcheck, press the Up arrow once and the Down arrow once. This
will read you the entire line. With JAWS, you can press Insert Up arrow once
and JAWS will read you the current line. With NVDA, you can read the current
line by pressing Num Pad 8. With Narrator, press either Insert I or Insert Up
arrow. Now press F7 to get back into Spellcheck and you will return to exactly
where you left off. </p>

<h4>9.1.1.2 2019 or 365 Spellcheck in Word</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>In my opinion, the Word 2019 or 365 version of Spellcheck is
a big improvement over earlier versions for two reasons. First, it
automatically gives much more contextual information, so you can quickly decide
whether or not to accept suggested changes. Second, you always land in the same
place in the dialog box, rather than on the previously-activated button. This
is less confusing than with the older version. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As with the older version press F7 to start the Spellchecker.
For documents of one hundred words or more, you will first hear a percentage
calculation of correct spellings in the document. If no spelling or grammatical
errors have been detected, you will instead hear “no issues found” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If errors have been detected, press the Spacebar to start
spellchecking. In the Tab order, here’s what you will encounter in the dialog
box:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Your screen reader will read the misspelled word letter by
letter, and then the suggested correct spelling, letter by letter. It will then
read you the phrase or sentence where that word appears, giving you immediate
contextual information. You can press Enter to accept the change and move to
the next misspelling, or you can press Tab twice to move to a split button and
press the Spacebar on that to accept the change. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Read original sentence button: Press the Spacebar on this button
and the full sentence where the word appears will be read back to you, giving
you additional contextual information.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A split button with the first suggested spelling or grammar
correction. Press the Spacebar to accept or Press Alt Down arrow for more
options. Options include hearing the word read back to you again, letter by
letter spelling, a change all button, and a few other options.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Additional split buttons you can move through by tabbing if there
is more than one suggested correct spelling. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Ignore button (I)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Ignore all button (G)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add button (A)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the above may sound a bit complicated, with practice
you will quickly get used to whichever Spellcheck utility you have.</p>

<h4>9.1.1.3 Customizing Spellcheck in Word and Outlook</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>By default, spelling errors are announced as you type by
making various sounds. Also by default, when you run the Spellcheck utility,
possible grammar errors are also announced. Some people (myself included)
prefer not to hear spelling errors announced as they type. It may make it
harder for them to concentrate on writing content. It may also compel them to
correct spelling errors one by one rather than using the Spellcheck utility
which is a more efficient way to correct errors. Many people don’t want the distraction
of checking grammar, instead using this utility exclusively for detecting and
correcting spelling errors, and thus speeding up the whole process. Spellcheck
can be customized in the Proofing part of the Word and Outlook Options
categories. How you get there is slightly different between the two
applications. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To navigate to the Proofing dialog in Word and make the
above-mentioned changes:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'><a name="_Hlk93584613">1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Press Alt F t to

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.75in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow or press P to first-letter navigate to the Proofing category.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.75in'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Check spelling as you type checkbox, and press the Spacebar
to uncheck it if you do not want to be notified about grammar errors while you
type.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.75in'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Mark grammar errors as you type checkbox, and press the
Spacebar to uncheck it if you do not want to be notified of spelling errors
while you type.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.75in'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Check grammar and refinements in the editor pane checkbox and
press the Spacebar to uncheck it if you do not want grammar errors detected
while running the Spellcheck utility.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
0in;margin-left:.75in'>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To make the same changes in Outlook:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-top:0in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F t to access the Options categories list.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-top:0in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow once to the Mail category.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-top:0in'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to Editor options and press Enter. This lands you on the
Proofing dialog. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-top:0in'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat steps three through five above.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-top:0in'>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt'>6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shift Tab to a
second OK button and press Enter.</p>

<h3>9.1.2 Spellcheck Excel Spreadsheets</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spellchecking Excel spreadsheets with the three screen
reader applications requires a few workarounds. As with Word or Outlook, start
Spellcheck by pressing F7. The Spellcheck utility will detect the first
perceived misspelling from where your cursor is situated. You first land on the
Suggested language combo box in the Spellcheck dialog. And guess what? This is
not the 2019 or 2016 Spellcheck dialog, but the one from Office 2010 and
earlier!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unlike in Word, you will not first hear the misspelled word
and suggested correct word, letter by letter. If you just want to hear the
suggested replacement spelling, Shift Tab once to the list of suggested
corrections. You will hear the first recommended word, and JAWS will spell it
out. With NVDA and Narrator, press Caps Lock and Numpad 5 twice to hear it
spelled out character by character. You can also Down arrow to alternative
choices. To accept a spelling change, press Enter on it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other elements of the Spellcheck dialog resemble those of
the Word/Outlook 2010 version. Fortunately, it is not that different from newer
versions. Instead of tabbing, you can use the following shortcut keys:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt C: Change (accept the suggested correction).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-top:0in'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt L: Change all.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-top:0in'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt I: Ignore once.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-top:0in'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt G: Ignore all.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt A: Add to dictionary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>How to hear misspelled words
varies between the screen readers. With JAWS, press Insert F7 and JAWS will
spell out both the misspelled word and suggested correct choice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>To hear the misspelled word with
NVDA, after landing on the Suggested language combo box, Shift Tab twice to Not
in dictionary. Then Down arrow once to hear the word spoken in its entirety.
Now Left and Right arrow to hear it spoken character by character. You can also
use this technique with JAWS if you can’t remember the Insert F7 keystroke
mentioned above.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>with Narrator, hearing the misspelled word character by
character is a bit more cumbersome. As above, Shift Tab twice after landing on
the Suggested language combo box. You will hear the misspelled word in its
entirety. Press Caps Lock plus Numpad five twice to hear it spelled out.
Unfortunately, you will first hear &quot;not in dictionary” spelled out before
hearing the misspelled word. If you do not have a number pad, press Caps Lock
and K twice. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you start spellchecking with your focus on a cell other
than A1, when you get to the last misspelled word on the sheet, you will be
asked if you wan to continue checking from the beginning. Press the Spacebar if
you want to do that; otherwise, press Escape to exit the Spellcheck utility. To
spellcheck workbooks with multiple sheets, you must perform it in each
individual worksheet. </p>

<h2>9.1.3 Spellchecking PowerPoint Presentations</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spellchecking in PowerPoint works poorly in conjunction with
screen reader programs. It is possible to use it with a rather awkward JAWS
workaround. While I am aware of an NVDA workaround, I was not able to replicate
it, and even if I could, I sensed that it was simply not worth the effort. To
the best of my knowledge, no Narrator workaround exists, and if there is one, here
too, I doubt it is even worth even trying.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before discussing the JAWS workaround, I strongly suggest
you do one of the following two things instead. First, simply check your
spelling while preparing your presentation and make corrections manually.
PowerPoint presentations should not be too wordy, so there is not nearly as
much to check as with a lengthy Word document. If you are a decent speller,
this should probably suffice. Better yet, prepare your text and any speaker’s
notes in Word, including spellchecking it there. Then copy the text from Word
and paste it into the individual placeholders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Regarding the JAWS workaround, if you want to try this out,
you can use the practice file entitled “Disclosure and Accommodations.badly
spelled.ppt.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>when you invoke the Spellchecker with F7, two weird things
happen. First, focus does not immediately land on the Spellcheck dialog. You
must press Tab to place focus on it. And second, you either hear nothing or
just the word “edit.” You do not hear the incorrectly spelled word and the
proposed correct spelling. To hear the misspelled word and the suggested
correction, press Insert F7, and JAWS will say them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now press Tab or Shift Tab to go to whichever button you
want to choose (change, ignore, etc.) and press it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s say you pressed the Change button to accept the
proposed correction. This brings you to the next misspelled word and the same
problems occur again. You must Tab once, which places focus on the Change All
button. Press Insert F7 again to hear the misspelled word and proposed
correction. If you want to accept it, press Shift Tab once and then the
Spacebar on the adjacent Change button.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Assuming that you will be accepting the bulk of the
suggested changes, you can perhaps develop a rhythm of Tab, Insert F7, Shift
Tab, Spacebar, Tab, Insert F7, Shift Tab, Spacebar, and so on. And if you are a
decent typist with a reasonably good grasp of spelling, it is not so unwieldy.</p>

<h2>9.2 Detecting Punctuation Errors</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Spellcheck detects extra spaces between words, but this is
the only type of punctuation error it finds. Nor is it entirely dependable for
finding all occurrences of this type of punctuation error. Fortunately, there
are better tools for detecting an array of punctuation errors. Before
describing these below, keep in mind that when proofreading, it can be useful
to adjust screen reader settings to read all punctuation. How to make these
changes was covered in Chapters 8.1.1 for JAWS, 8.2.2 for NVDA, and 8.3.1 for
Narrator.</p>

<h3>9.2.1 JAWS Text Analyzer </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Text Analyzer is especially valuable for detecting
punctuation errors, although it can also be used for checking font formatting.
NVDA and Narrator have no comparable tool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Hold down Alt Windows I together and Text Analyzer will jump
to the next punctuation error or format change, which it calls an
“inconsistency.” It will also announce a column number (as in, “space run at
column 473”), but this has no practical value. Your cursor is placed in the
text where the perceived error is located. Left or Right arrow a few times in
this vicinity to find exactly where the problem is and do your edits. Press Alt
Windows I again to jump to the next inconsistency, and continue on until Text
Analyzer says, “no more inconsistencies in document.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Punctuation errors that Text Analyzer detects include: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Space runs: Extra spaces between words. Also detects incorrectly
placed tabs.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Stray punctuation: Periods, commas, and other punctuation marks
with at least one space between them and preceding characters.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Unclosed/unopened quotes: Missing quotation marks at
beginning/end of quote.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Unopened/unclosed parentheses: Mismatched parentheses, i.e., only
the left or right parenthesis present with no corresponding right/left
parenthesis nearby.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Missing capitals: No capital letter at beginning of a sentence. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Inverted capitals: Inverted lowercase and uppercase letters. For
example, the first letter of a proper noun is lowercase while the rest of the
word is uppercase. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With regard to space runs, in principle, Spellcheck detects
these too, calling them extra spaces between words. However, Text Analyzer is
much more reliable. Recently, I spellchecked several documents, totaling about
25 pages. Spellcheck detected several instances of extra spaces between words.
However, when I ran Text Analyzer immediately afterward, it detected additional
instances that Spellcheck had missed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Text Analyzer will also detect font changes, including font
name, size, attributes, and color. This can be useful for detecting unexpected
font anomalies. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can customize Text Analyzer to choose what you want
detected. For example, if you have many headings in your document, you may want
to stop it from detecting font changes, so that you can focus on punctuation
errors. Alternatively, you may wish to check just font changes if you are
expecting few or no font changes in a document, and you want to be sure that
you did not inadvertently insert some. I have used Text Analyzer for this and
have sometimes been surprised at how many weird and inexplicable font changes
have found their way into my documents, even after assiduously updating my
normal text style to supposedly prevent such errors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Text analyzer customization is done in JAWS Settings Center.
Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert 6 (on the number row) to open Settings Center.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Tab once to get to the tree view.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow or first-letter navigate to Text Analyzer.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow once to expand the tree view where a list of formatting and
punctuation categories are listed. These categories are symbols, punctuation
inconsistencies, and font changes. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow on one of these categories to expand its corresponding list
in the tree view.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow through the list, pressing the Spacebar to check on or off
the items you want detected or not detected. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open additional categories in the tree view and check or uncheck the
items you want detected or not detected. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When finished, Tab to the OK button and press Enter or
Spacebar.</p>

<h3>9.2.2 Find and Replace </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>While neither NVDA nor Narrator have a tool like JAWS Text
Analyzer, you can use Word’s Find and replace dialog to correct some of the
punctuation errors mentioned in the preceding section. In fact, if you suspect
that the number of space runs or stray punctuation errors may be numerous, it
is quicker to use Find and replace to correct them all at once, rather than
correct them one-by-one with Text Analyzer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To detect and correct space runs using Find and replace, do
the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control H to open the Find and replace dialog. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the Find edit field where you first land, type in two spaces.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Replace field and type in a single space.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab three times to the Replace all button, and press Enter or the
Spacebar. Your screen reader will say, “all done. We made 19 replacements,” or
whatever the number is. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on the OK button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you mistakenly put in more than two unwanted spaces between words,
this will not delete all the errors. Now press Alt A to perform Find and
replace again.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press OK and Alt A until you hear zero replacements. Then press Escape
to exit the Find and replace dialog. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also use Find and replace To correct stray
punctuation mark errors (commas, periods, colons, and semi-colons). Using stray
commas as an example, type space comma in the Find edit field and comma by
itself in the Replace edit field. Then repeat steps four through seven above. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The other types of errors detected by Text Analyzer
(unclosed/unopened parentheses and quotes and a few others) cannot be corrected
using this method, but using Find and replace is a good way to quickly get rid
of a substantial number of common punctuation errors in your documents.</p>

<h2>9.3 Proofreading Text Formatting</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In Chapter 3.2.1, I covered using Insert F to reveal font
and paragraph formatting at individual points of a document or for a segment of
selected text. While this is useful for checking formatting at individual
points in a document, Insert F does not give a more global view of document
formatting. Think of Insert F as a good tool for giving a micro-level glimpse
of document formatting. The tools discussed below provide a more complete, or
macro, picture. If you discover unintended formatting changes, you can then
correct them. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc1629888">9.3.1 JAWS Speech and Sounds Schemes</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Speech and Sounds Schemes tool helps you detect font
formatting changes by telling you what changes have occurred as you navigate
through the text. There are several categories of schemes, but we will only
discuss the Classic category. To open Speech and Sounds Schemes, hold Insert
Alt S down together. JAWS will say “select a scheme dialog.” It will also say
the current default scheme, which if you have never opened this before is the
Classic scheme within the broader Classic category. To change the scheme, press
the Down arrow or first-letter navigate to the one you want and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Within the Classic category you can choose among schemes
which give you varying amounts of formatting information. The most relevant
Classic choices are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Classic: No font information is read back to you. This is what
you are used to hearing.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Classic, Attributes: Bold, italics, and underlining are read back
to you.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Classic, Attributes, and Font Info: Font name as well as bold,
italics, and underlining are read back to you.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Classic, Attributes, Font, and Color: Font name, bold, italics,
underlining, and color are read back to you. You should choose this one when
you are proofing your formatting because it provides the most information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you change the scheme, it becomes the default for Word
until you change it back again. Use these various schemes only when you are
proofreading. Remember to switch back to Classic when you are done. Otherwise,
you will continue to hear this formatting feedback in all Word documents. It
will quickly drive you crazy.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc1629889">9.3.2 NVDA Document Formatting</a> </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This tool serves a similar purpose as JAWS Speech and Sounds
Schemes, but can be used to reveal much more than just font changes. To access
it, you can either use the shortcut Insert Control D, or go in via the NVDA
menus. Steps for accessing document formatting through the menus are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the NVDA menus by pressing Insert N. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Preferences submenu and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on Settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow or first-letter navigate to Document Formatting. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab through the choices, and use the Spacebar to check those elements
that you wish NVDA to detect.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter or Spacebar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you Tab through the Document Formatting dialog, you will
find that there are quite a few format settings that NVDA can announce as you
read through a document. Most are relevant for Word documents. A few are useful
for Excel and web browsing. The choices are organized in groups and include:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Font: Name, size, attributes, emphasis, style, color.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Document information: Comments, editor revisions, spelling
errors.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Pages and spacing: Page numbers, line numbers, line indentation,
paragraph indentation, line spacing (single, double, etc.), alignment.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Table information: Tables, row/column headers, cell coordinates,
cell borders.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Elements: Headings, links, lists, block quotes, landmarks,
frames, clickable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The only drawback to using the NVDA Document Formatting tool
is that it cannot be toggled on and off. Therefore, when you are finished
proofreading, you will need to go back into the dialog box and uncheck all the
items that you no longer want announced. You will definitely want to do this.
As with JAWS Speech and Sounds Schemes, the verbal feedback on format changes
can be overwhelming. However, I recommend that you do not uncheck items in the
Elements group. These are important for web browsing. </p>

<h3>9.3.3 Narrator Verbosity Levels for Formatting</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can vary the amount of verbosity Narrator speaks for
proofreading document formatting. This was mentioned in Chapter 1.4.1 as one of
the elements in Narrator Settings. You can quickly cycle through the five
verbosity levels by pressing Insert V. The levels are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Level one: Text only..</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Level two: Some control details.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Level three: All control details (the default level).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Level four: Some text details: gives most text attributes (bold,
italics, heading levels, etc.).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Level five: All text details.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Level five is best for proofreading a document. This level
provides complete details about heading levels, font attributes, type and size,
bulleting and numbering, and other formatting information. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc1629890">9.4 Tools for Collaborative Review </a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Word has two useful tools you can use when working
collaboratively on documents – Comments and Track Changes. You can insert
comments into documents if you have questions or suggestions on ways to revise
a document. Comments are usually focused on identifying possible substantive
revisions. I think Comments are a great tool for reviewing documents among
collaborators. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Track Changes (also known as Revisions) focus on detailed
editing. This is important for legal documents. Exact wording and precise
punctuation are important in such documents and are subject to negotiation.
Lawyers and others drafting contracts frequently use Track Changes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I need to make one caution here. Track Changes is a great
visual tool. Yet in my opinion, interpreting the audio feedback provided by
your screen reader program is confusing and exhausting. If you have to use
Track Changes because you have sighted colleagues who use them, then by all
means, bite the bullet and try to become comfortable with them. But if you have
an alternative way to work collaboratively on documents where it is important
to monitor lots of proposed small changes, you may prefer using that instead.
For example, some reviewers and editors put proposed changes in brackets. You
can then use the Find command (Control F) to search for left brackets. </p>

<h3>9.4.1 Comments</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can insert electronic comments in your documents. These
are useful when collaborating on team projects. Also, instructors will often
insert comments in term papers and other assignments. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To add a comment to your document:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor on the line where you wish the comment to appear. If
you wish to reference specific text on a line, select that text first. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Up arrow once to New comment, and press
Enter. This opens the Comment pane where you can type in text. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Once you have written your text, press Escape to exit the Comment pane
and return to the document. Do not Press Enter or Tab. These will just put a
hard return or tab in the Comment pane. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also use the shortcut key (Alt R C) to add a comment.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>JAWS has several ways to access comments that are already in
documents. The easiest way is to switch from Edit mode to Quick keys mode.
Press Insert Z and JAWS will say “Quick keys on.” Now Press N to jump to the
next comment after your cursor point, and JAWS will read it. Shift N will go to
the previous comment and read it. If instructors have inserted comments into
term papers, this is a great way to get a quick sense of their impressions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have inserted a couple of comments in this section. If you
are reading the electronic version of this book in Word, use the various ways
mentioned above for accessing <a>them</a><span class=MsoCommentReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;line-height:107%'><a class=msocomanchor id="_anchor_1"
onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_1','_com_1')"
onmouseout="msoCommentHide('_com_1')" href="#_msocom_1" language=JavaScript
name="_msoanchor_1">[DK1]</a>&nbsp;</span></span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS, you can also open a virtual viewer to access a
list of comments. To open the virtual viewer, press the Windows and Semi-Colon
keys together. This gives you a list of four items to view. The first item in
the list is comments. Press Enter and JAWS will indicate how many comments are
in the document. Down arrow and you will hear a numbered link and the comment’s
author. The text of the comment appears under the link. Continue Down arrowing and
you will hear the link and text for the second comment, and so on. Press Enter
on the link if you wish to navigate to the location of the comment in the text,
pressing Enter on a link navigates to the vicinity of the comment in your
document, but does not place your focus within the comment itself. Press Escape
if you just want to exit the virtual viewer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, with JAWS, you can customize what feedback you hear
on comments as you are reading through the document line by line or in Say all
mode. Customization is done in JAWS Quick Settings. To access these options,
while in Word press Insert V to open the Quick Settings dialog. In the edit box
where you land, type in the word “comment.” Now Down arrow to “comments,
footnotes and endnotes detection” and press the Spacebar to cycle through the
four options, which are: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Off: No comment information is provided. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>On: Says “has comment.” </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>On with text: Reads the comment, as well as the name of the
comment’s author. With Eloquence voices, JAWS reads this information with a
lower pitch (no pitch change for Vocalizer Expressive or Microsoft voices). </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>On plus count: In Say all mode, the same feedback is provided as
with On with text. When Down or Up arrowing to read by line, JAWS will indicate
the number of comments on the line. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>When you have made one of the above
choices in Quick Settings, Tab to the OK button and press the Spacebar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you wish to hear comments as you are navigating through
the text, On with text is your best choice. If you do not want to hear any
comment information, choose Off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also navigate to comments via the Word ribbons or
use shortcut keys. The shortcut key to go to the next comment is Alt R N. To go
to the previous comment, press Alt R V. The Comments group is located in the
Review tab. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you press Alt R N, your screen reader enters into the
next comment pane where, among other things, you can edit it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With NVDA, another way to access comments is to open the
Elements list as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert Spacebar to switch to Browse mode. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert F7 to open the Elements list.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Shift Tab once to get to the list of different elements.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow to the Annotations radio button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once and the list of comments will appear. Up or Down arrow to move
through the comments to listen to them. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on one of them if you wish to navigate to the location of
that comment in your document. Otherwise, press Escape to exit the Elements
list.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Insert Spacebar again when you want to exit Browse mode and return
to Edit mode. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.25in'>To get a list of comments with
Narrator, you can open Word’s Review pane by pressing Alt R T P, and then
either H or V. You can Down arrow to read the comments line by line. Then press
Escape twice to return to the main document. You can not use the Review pane to
navigate to any of the comments. Press Escape twice to return to the main body
of the document.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can delete individual comments as well as reply to them,
but you must be inside the Comment pane to do this. Otherwise, you will be
unable to access these two choices via the Applications key. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You may decide to delete an individual comment after you
have revised the text to address it, or because you decide to ignore it. When
you have finalized your document, always delete all comments before circulating
it to <a>others</a><span class=MsoCommentReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal>When your document is in its final version, be sure to
delete all comments if you have not already done so. To delete all comments at

<p class=MsoNormal>To verify that you have indeed deleted all the comments, use
any of the methods outlined above for detecting existing comments. You should
now hear that there are no comments in your document. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc1629891">9.4.2 Track Changes or Revisions</a> </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a Word feature also found in the Review tab of the
ribbons. It is supported by JAWS and NVDA, but not currently by Narrator. The
terms Track Changes and Revisions are used interchangeably. This tool is used
to display text changes, that is, insertions, deletions, and format changes. As
with the Comments tool, Track Changes is used in collaborative or team
settings. The tool is most commonly used when very specific word changes are
important. Lawyers and contract negotiators are frequent users of Track
Changes. For them, precise wording and punctuation are critical. A misplaced
comma or incorrect word choice could have major impacts. In such situations, it
is important for all parties to see specific suggested text changes. A grammar
instructor might also use Track Changes to clearly identify writing mistakes in
an assignment submitted by a student. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To turn Track Changes on, hold down Control, Shift, and E
together (this is a toggle). JAWS says, “Track Changes on.” NVDA and Narrator
do not announce it. At this point, any edits (insertions, deletions, and font
changes) you make will be registered. Note that font changes are announced as
“properties.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you later turn Track Changes off, any subsequent edits
will not be registered. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you have activated Track Changes, when you insert new
text and navigate through the document, JAWS will announce the text and say
that it has been inserted. JAWS will do the same for deleted text. NVDA will
only announce insertions when you are navigating the document. To also hear
deletions, you will need to use one of the methods identified below. Font
changes (font name, attributes like bold and italics, point size, and color)
are announced as “properties” by both JAWS and NVDA. To detect what actual font
changes have been made, navigate just past where the change is announced and
press Insert F. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS, you can customize how revisions are announced as
you move through the text. This is done in Quick Settings, which is opened with
Insert V. Your cursor lands in the search box where you can type in Track
Changes. You will get only one search result, so press the Down arrow once.
Then press the Spacebar to cycle through the seven options, which are: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Do not detect revisions: The option is turned off. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Speak revision type: JAWS announces the type of revision made.
For example, inserted text or deleted text. This is the default. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Speak revision type plus count: JAWS also announces the
revision’s placement in the document. For example, if this is the third
revision, JAWS says “third.” </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Speak revision type and author: JAWS also announces the username
of the individual who made the revision. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Speak revision type and author plus count</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Speak revision type, author, and date: JAWS also announces the
date the revision was made. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Speak revision type, author, and date plus count</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After making your selection, Tab to the OK button and press
Enter or Spacebar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With NVDA, you can only hear the revision type and the
accompanying text. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Parallel to how comments are accessed, JAWS has several ways
to access revisions beyond simply navigating through the document. Turn on
Quick keys with Insert Z, and press R to jump to the next revision, or Shift R
to go to the previous one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also access a list of revisions using the same
virtual viewer used for comments, footnotes, and endnotes. Track Changes must
first be turned on for this to work. Press the Windows and Semi-Colon keys
together and either Down arrow to Revisions or press R to first-letter navigate
there. Now press Enter and the virtual comments viewer opens. When you press
the Down arrow, you will hear links with the text of the revisions immediately
under the links. Press Enter on one of the links if you wish to go to that
revision in the text, or press Escape to exit the virtual viewer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can access revisions several ways with NVDA. First,
activate Browse mode by holding down the Insert and Spacebar together. Then
press A, which will jump to the next “annotation.” Revisions count as
annotations, as do comments. Unlike with JAWS, it is not necessary to have
Track Changes turned on for this to work. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, with Browse mode on, you can bring up the Elements
list with Insert F9. Press Shift Tab once and Up or Down arrow to the
Annotations radio button. Now Tab to the list of annotations. This list
includes inserted and deleted text, as well as comments, and are clearly
labeled as such. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once revisions have been made to a document, you have the
ability to accept or reject them via the Applications key. The easiest way to
do this is to press the Left or Right arrow until the cursor is inside the
revised text. JAWS clearly says “revision” when you move into a revision and
“out of revision” when you move out of it. So, for example, if the change is an
insertion, and with your cursor inside the revision text, press the
Applications key, and Down arrow to Accept insertion or Delete insertion. Press
Enter on your choice. The change is made, and is no longer counted as a
revision in your document. If the change you want to accept or reject is a
deletion or a format change, this will also be clearly stated in the context
menu. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When arrowing into or out of revisions, NVDA will also
indicate this. However, NVDA’s audio feedback on this is less straightforward
than that of JAWS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is one important caveat to note here. If Word detects
that the revision you want to make has a spelling error, the context menu will
consist of Spellcheck options. The Accept Revision and Reject Revision options
will not appear in the context menu. You will need to address the Spelling
issue before you can accept or reject the revision. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As was the case with comments, you should remove all traces
of revisions from your final document before circulating it. Do this by
accepting all revisions. The shortcut key is Alt R A 2 S. It does not matter
whether Track Changes is turned on or off for this to work. To navigate there
via the ribbons:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the Review tab on the Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Right arrow to get to the Tracking group. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Accept split button and press Alt Down arrow to expand the
options. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Accept all changes and stop tracking, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use one of the above-mentioned JAWS or NVDA methods for
listing or navigating to revisions to confirm that none remain in the document.</p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'><br

10 Other Important Applications, Topics, and Tools</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>This final chapter discusses a set of other useful
applications, topics, and tools. These include reading PDFs with Adobe Acrobat
Reader DC, file sharing with Dropbox and OneDrive, and several other useful
tips and tricks. I conclude by identifying some commonly encountered issues and
possible ways to address them. </p>

<h2>10.1 Accessing PDF Files with Adobe Acrobat Reader DC</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>A portable document format file (PDF) is a file format
designed to present documents consistently across multiple devices and
platforms. Note that I will use an apostrophe in this book for the plural form
of PDF because it reads better with screen readers. PDF’s are frequently used
for financial and legal documents so that recipients can not edit them in any
way. Professional journal articles and promotional flyers with elaborate
formatting and images are other examples of documents that commonly appear as PDF’s.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While each of the web browser applications have PDF viewers,
for the most consistent results in terms of accessibility, screen reader
experts usually recommend using Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. This is free software
that can be downloaded from:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="https://get.adobe.com/reader/">Adobe Acrobat Reader
DC Download Free PDF viewer for Windows, Mac OS, Android</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:windowtext;
text-decoration:none'>When you download this software, read through the page
carefully. There are several checkboxes that are checked by default for
downloading additional software. If you do not want to download this software,
be sure to uncheck these checkboxes before downloading the Acrobat Reader DC
installation file.</span></span></p>

<h3>10.1.1 Acrobat Reader Accessibility Settings</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once downloaded and installed, Acrobat Reader detects that
you are using assistive technology software, and you land in the first panel of
the Accessibility setup wizard. Proceed through it as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You first land on a tab with three radio buttons for adjusting assistive
technology settings. Up or Down arrow to your choice: all accessibility
options, screen reader options, and screen magnification options. If you only
use a screen reader program, choose this radio button. If you have some usable
vision, choose the All accessibility options radio button instead. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Next button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you chose the All options radio button in the first panel, the second
panel identifies screen magnification options. Go through these if you have
some usable vision. In the order in which they appear, tabs are: a high
contrast checkbox; a combo box with four high contrast foreground and
background color options; a field highlighting color combo box; a required
field color combo box; and a disable text smoothing checkbox (check this if you
want a crisper delineation between foreground characters and the background).
When finished in this panel, Tab to the Next button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing to change in this pane whose first option is Infer
reading order from document, Tab to the Next button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You first land on a set of radio buttons for determining how much of the
PDF is loaded upon opening it. Up or Down arrow to the Read the entire document
at once radio button. This is recommended, because in most instances, you will
want to access the entire document, list of headings, links, etc. This is the
only recommended change in this pane. Tab to the Next button and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Reopen document to the last page viewed checkbox. Leave
it unchecked if you want PDF’s to always reopen on the first page. Otherwise,
check it if you want your place to be saved from the previous session for each
file. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Done button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can later return to adjust the additional settings
described below as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on the Acrobat Reader DC desktop shortcut. This was created
during the program installation process.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the menu bar. This is a classic drop-down menu setup. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow once to the Edit menu, Up arrow several times to the
Accessibility submenu and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Setup assistant and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Follow the steps outlined above to make any desired accessibility
changes. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is one more change to make. Disabling Protected view
is absolutely crucial. Until you do this, you simply will not be able to read
PDF’s with your screen reader. Steps are: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the menu, Right arrow once to the Edit menu, Up arrow
to Preferences, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This opens a categories list. Press S until you get to Security
enhanced.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Enable Protected view at startup checkbox and press the
Spacebar to uncheck it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the OK button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Pres Alt F4 to close Acrobat Reader and then reopen it. The application
must be closed for this change to take effect. </p>

<h3>10.1.2 Setting Acrobat Reader As Your Default PDF Viewer</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each web browser has a feature for viewing PDF’s. In Windows
10, Microsoft has set Edge as the default PDF viewer. This means that when you
open any PDF, it will open in Edge. After installing Acrobat Reader, you will
want to make it your default PDF viewer instead of Edge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just after you install Adobe Reader, you may be asked if you
want to open all PDF’s with it. If you receive this prompt, be sure to check
the appropriate checkbox to confirm. However, this prompt does not consistently
appear. If you do not encounter it, when you first attempt to open a PDF,
instead of pressing Enter to open it, press the Applications key, Down arrow to
the Open with submenu, and press Enter. You land in a list of installed
programs that can view PDF’s. Up or Down arrow to Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. Tab
to see if there is a checkbox here for making it the default. If yes, check it,
Tab to the OK button and press Enter. This PDF and all subsequent PDF’s should
open in Acrobat Reader. Unfortunately, here too, it is inconsistent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The one surefire way to change your default PDF viewer to
Acrobat Reader is to do so through the Windows Settings, but options for doing
this differ according to your Windows 10 version. If you are using Windows 10
Build 2004 or earlier:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Hlk69915252">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the windows key to open the search box, type in the first few
letters of “Default apps system settings” until you hear it, and then press
Enter.</a></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Choose default by file type link and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This opens an extremely long alphabetical list of file extensions, each
starting with a period. You must Tab through these. First-letter navigation is
not possible. Rather than press the Tab key repeatedly which will take far too
long to reach the PDF extension, hold down the Tab key for about 10 or 15
seconds, and then release it. Hopefully, you will be close to the dot PDF
extension. When you eventually land on it, press the Spacebar, which opens a
shorter list of programs that could be chosen as the default PDF viewer.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Adobe Acrobat Reader DC and press the Spacebar to select it as
your new default PDF viewer.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F4 to close this window. There is no OK button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To verify, open a PDF file saved on your computer. It should now open in
Acrobat Reader.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If instead, you are using the 20H2 Windows 10 version or a
more recent version:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Windows key to open the Start menu. You land in the search
box, type in the first few letters of “Default apps system settings” until you
hear it, and then press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Set default by apps link, and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to where it says, “set your default programs.” This lands you
in a list of the programs installed on your computer. Down arrow to Adobe
Acrobat Reader DC and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Manage button and press the Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to dot PDF where you will also hear its current default program
association, and press the Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and press the Spacebar to select it as
the new default.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F4 to close the window. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To verify, open a PDF file saved on your computer. It should open in
Acrobat Reader.</p>

<h3>10.1.3 Reading and Navigation Keystrokes</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Assuming no major accessibility problems exist with the PDF
you have opened, all standard reading and navigation keystrokes used with Word
work with PDF’s. This includes navigating to next and previous pages with
Control Page down and Control Page up, respectively. A few keystrokes are
different:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Search command: To search for text, press Control Insert F
(rather than Control F as is the case with Word), type in the text, and press
Enter. That keystroke works with all three screen readers for finding the first
occurrence of a search term. To jump to the next occurrence, press F3 with
JAWS, and Insert F3 with NVDA and Narrator.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Go to page command: With any of the screen readers, press Control
Shift N to hear your current page location. You can then type in a page number
and press Enter to navigate to that page.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS, you can also find out your page location by
pressing Shift F4 (which toggles off the Acrobat Reader Tools pane), and then
pressing Insert Page down. This brings up the Status bar. You will hear “4/20,”
indicating that you are on the fourth page of a 20 page document. To
subsequently access the Status bar during the same session with this PDF, just
press Insert Page down. It is not necessary to press Shift F4 again. </p>

<h3>10.1.4 Reading PDF’s with Varying Levels of Accessibility</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Reading PDF’s used to be an accessibility nightmare.
Fortunately, tools have been developed in recent years to remedy a number of
accessibility problems. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To make PDF’s accessible, those who prepare them need to
take two factors into account: tags, which label and structure the content, and
reading order, which controls the sequence in which the content is voiced to
the user. If both factors are properly addressed, screen reader users will be
able to efficiently navigate and reading will be clear and comprehensible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I will go through a set of examples using the files in the
ZIP folder that accompanies this book. To follow along, open them in a separate
window and press Alt Tab to switch between this text and the PDF.</p>

<h4>10.1.4.1 Fully Accessible PDF Files</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>PDF’s can be designed to be fully accessible in much the
same way as web pages on the Internet. You can navigate as follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>By heading, by pressing H.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>By heading level, by pressing 1, 2, 3, etc. on the number row.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>By table, by pressing T, and within tables, by pressing Control
Alt and the four arrow keys.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>To form fields, by pressing E to get to edit fields, X to get to
checkboxes, and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the PDF is an accessible form (referred to as a “fillable
form”), after having partially or completely filled it out, you can save the
revised file. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The standard two-page Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax
form is a good example of a fillable PDF form. Open the file entitled “Form
1040.pdf.” All the keystrokes mentioned above will work with this file. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To save it after filling some of the form fields:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Alt key to open the menu bar. This lands you on the File menu.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Save as and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in the Filename edit box of the standard Save as (dialog box
(see Chapter 2.9 for the full discussion of this dialog box). If you are
revising a previously blank form, you may want to rename the file here to
create a new file and preserve the blank form. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter if you want to save it in the same folder as the original
blank PDF. Otherwise, Shift Tab back several times to designate a different
folder location.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you simply want to save it with the revisions in the same
folder and with the same name, press Control S to save the updated file. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, you will often encounter what I will call
“unfillable PDF forms.” These are PDF’s that have not been created with
accessible edit fields and checkboxes. They are inaccessible because you will
not be able to fill them out independently. Instead, you will first have to
print them in hard copy and have a sighted person fill them out for you.</p>

<h4>10.1.4.2. Changing Reading Order</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>For PDF documents, “reading order” refers to the sequential
presentation of content by screen readers and other assistive technology.
Ideally, the screen reader reads the content as it appears on the screen, and
in a way that is comprehensible. However, reading problems occur from time to
time in untagged or improperly tagged PDF’s. Text may sound jumbled or garbled.
Words sound like they are running together without spaces between them. If you
are using Eloquence voices with your screen reader, reading may even switch to
a foreign language accent or syntax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of the time, changing to a different reading order will
quickly fix the problem. To change reading order, press Control Shift 5 (on the
number row). You land in a list of reading order options, with your focus on
the current reading order. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the top of the list, reading order options are: </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:.75in'><span style='font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal>Up or Down arrow to one of these other options and press
Enter. By trial and error, you will usually pick one that solves the problem.
You can press Control S to save the file with its new reading order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The file “What Is Mixed Reality.pdf” is an example where
reading is garbled for screen reader users. Changing reading order to one of
the other choices will make it read clearly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If using an Eloquence voice with JAWS, the file “Team
Viewer.pdf” reads with a thick German accent, even though it is an English
language document. Or at least this is what happens on my computer. Here too,
changing the reading order resolves this problem. </p>

<h4>10.1.4.3 JAWS Convenient OCR</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a PDF has been created from a scanned image, it is not
directly accessible with a screen reader. However, JAWS uses Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) technology to access these types of PDF’s. The JAWS utility
is called Convenient OCR and is extremely easy to use. Open the PDF. JAWS will
alert you that it is a scanned image and ask you to press the Spacebar to start
Convenient OCR. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once processing is finished, JAWS will read it to you.
Beginning with JAWS 2021, you can Tab once and press Enter to open the document
in Word. Here, you can save the text if desired. If you have an earlier version
of JAWS, you can select the text, copy it, and paste it into Word or Notepad. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There may be errors in the output, especially if the quality
of the original scanned image was poor. If you import the text into Word, it is
likely that you will need to edit and modify formatting if you want to make the
document presentable to others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>NVDA has an OCR feature, but I have never been able to make
it work, so will not cover it here. There are several ways to perform OCR with
Windows. I have never tried any of these, but if you wish to find out more,
activate the following link: </p>

OCR Ways to Extract Text from Images on Windows 10</a></p>

<h3>10.1.5 Adding Placemarkers </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similar to web pages, you can add placemarkers to PDF’s to
enable quick navigation to important text in the document. You can do this with
JAWS and NVDA, but not with Narrator. As on the web, you first mark a point in
the document as a temporary placemarker and then mark it as permanent. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With JAWS, steps for inserting placemarkers in PDF’s are as
follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the first placemarker you wish to insert, navigate to the text in
the PDF that you want to mark, and press Control Windows K to mark it as a
temporary placemarker. JAWS will say “temporary placemarker set.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift K. This opens the Placemarker list dialog where you
land on “temporary document.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Add button and press Enter. You land in an edit box populated
with the text of the line that you marked as a temporary placemarker. Edit this
to make it shorter, or leave it unchanged, and then press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I have found that on some computers, you can skip the first step of
creating a temporary placemarker before making it permanent, while on others,
you need to first create a temporary placemarker. See what works on your own
computer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To create an additional placemarker, navigate to the text
you want to mark. When you press Control Shift K to open the Placemarker list
dialog, previously created permanent placemarkers are listed here. Up or Down
arrow to “temporary document” and repeat step three above to make it permanent.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Similar to placemarkers on web pages, to navigate to the
next and previous placemarker, press K and Shift K, respectively. You can also
press Control Shift K to open the list of placemarkers. Then arrow up or down,
or first-letter navigate to the one you want, and press Enter to navigate to it
in the PDF. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To delete a permanent placemarker:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control Shift K to open the placemarker list.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Up or Down arrow to the one you want to delete.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Remove button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is also a Remove all button in the placemarker dialog
for deleting all permanent placemarkers at once. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To try this out, open the file entitled “college microwave
cooking.pdf.” Create three or four placemarkers, navigate through them, and
remove one or two. If you now press Control S to save the updated file, and
then reopen it, the previously-created placemarkers should have been retained. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To create placemarkers with NVDA, see Chapter 7.10.2.2.</p>

<h3><a name="_Hlk92481147">10.1.6 Saving a Word File as an Accessible PDF File</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any file you create in Word can easily be saved as a PDF.
Taking a little time to create an accessible source file will yield a more
accessible PDF. To make the file easily navigable, add headings with
appropriate levels. Any tables created will also be navigable. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Creating fillable PDF’s can only be reliably done using <span
style='font-family:"Source Sans Pro",sans-serif;color:#323232;background:white'>Adobe
Acrobat Pro DC. Unfortunately, the Pro version of this software is expensive
and the process for creating fillable forms is not accessible. </span>Although
it is possible to create forms in Word, it is neither easy to create such
forms, nor is it easy to fill them out.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[8]</span></span></span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To save a Word file as a PDF:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Word, press F12 to open the Save as dialog box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in an edit field where a filename with a.DOCXending is
proposed. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press tab once to navigate to the File type combo box, and press P to
select PDF.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><a name="_Hlk92481119">4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shift Tab once to return to the filename edit field. A PDF file
extension should have replaced the .DOCX file extension. Press Enter to save
the file as a PDF.</a></p>

<h2>10.2 Cloud Storage with Dropbox and OneDrive</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>Cloud storage is
a way to save files and folders online so they can be accessed on multiple
devices, as well as shared between those who have been given permission to
access them. Among the most popular cloud storage services are Dropbox,
OneDrive, and Google Drive. For those already familiar with PC-based file
management, getting comfortable with Dropbox and OneDrive is quick and easy.
The learning curve for Google Drive is considerably steeper. Consequently, I
will only cover Dropbox and OneDrive here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are various personal plans for Dropbox and OneDrive.
As of the time this book was written, a free Dropbox account entitled you to
two gigabytes (GB) of storage on up to three devices. For two terabytes of
storage, Dropbox Plus costs $9.99 per month, and a family plan (up to six
members) costs $16.99 per month. For more details on the various options,
including additional features, visit:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/buy">Buy your Dropbox plan
for personal or professional use</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you purchase a computer with the Windows 10 operating
system, five gigabytes of free storage with OneDrive are included on up to
three devices. You just need to sign up with your Microsoft account to access
the OneDrive folder located in your user folder. If you purchase a Microsoft
365 annual license ($69 for an individual account and $99 for up to six
people), one terabyte of storage (that is, 1000 gigabytes) of OneDrive storage
is included in this package. In my opinion, this is a great deal. For more
details, visit <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/compare-onedrive-plans?activetab=tab%3aprimaryr1">OneDrive
Cloud Storage Pricing and Plans</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Unlike OneDrive, you will need to create an
account and install Dropbox on your computer. This involves several steps and
is sometimes a bit clunky. To create a free account, start by going to <a
href="https://help.dropbox.com/installs-integrations/desktop/download-dropbox">How
to download and install Dropbox</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Under the first level two heading, you can follow the
instructions for downloading and installing the software, and signing up for a
free account. You will also need to be on the lookout for an email asking you
to verify your identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once the program is installed on your computer, a Dropbox
shortcut appears on your Desktop. The Dropbox folder is located in your user
folder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With the paid accounts for both programs, you can select
folders to download to your computer, and others to be stored only in the
cloud. If you anticipate using a significant amount of this storage space,
considering which folders you want to take up space on your computer may be an
important issue. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>For individuals,
there are four categories of sharing: between your devices, with other people
without editing rights, with other people with editing rights (also known as
sharing collaboratively), and between apps on your smartphone. Each will be
discussed below.</span></p>

<h3><span style='color:black;background:white'>10.2.1 Sharing Between Your
Devices </span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>If you work on
more than one device, you will derive benefits from cloud sharing because you
can share files and folders between them. I work on a personal computer, a
computer at work, and an iPhone. With these two cloud storage applications
installed on all three devices, I can effortlessly share files and folders
between them. If I add, delete or revise a file on one device, these changes
will be synchronized across my other devices. Before cloud sharing became
commonplace, I spent a lot of time carting around files on a thumb drive so I
could copy and paste them between my work and personal computers. Nowadays, any
changes I make on one computer are reflected on the other computer, and vice
versa. All without the hassle of constantly copying and pasting between
computers and a thumb drive. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>As part of the
Dropbox installation process, a Dropbox folder is placed in your user folder.
When you purchase a Windows PC, a OneDrive folder is already placed in your
user folder. However, you will need to sign in with your Microsoft email and
password to allow syncing between your devices. For Dropbox, a desktop shortcut
is placed on your Desktop. You may need to add a desktop shortcut for OneDrive.
Use the procedures in Chapter </span>2.8.2 <span style='color:black;background:
white'>to do this. You can now add folders and files to these folders and manage
them using the same procedures and shortcut keys that you use in any other
folder on your PC. The only difference is that these folders and files will
automatically be backed up to the Cloud, and be available on any of the other
devices where you have Dropbox and OneDrive installed, including your
smartphone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black;background:white'>The three other
forms of sharing are discussed below. These are: sharing without editing
rights; sharing collaboratively; and sharing between apps on your smartphone.</span></p>

<h3>10.2.2 Sharing Without Editing Rights</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>With both Dropbox and OneDrive, it is quick and easy to
share files and folders with other people without granting editing rights. <span
style='color:black;background:white'>Recipients of your shared files and
folders can download these to their computers, but whatever they do with them
will not effect your own files in any way. </span>Recipients are not required
to have their own Dropbox or OneDrive accounts when you share in this way. </p>

<h4>10.2.2.1 Dropbox</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In your Dropbox folder, place cursor focus on the file or folder you
wish to share. Do not open it. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to Copy Dropbox link, and press
Enter. This generates a hyperlink and places it on the Clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the body of an email message, paste the link from the Clipboard by
pressing Control V. A URL appears.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Send the email message to those recipients with whom you wish to share
the file or folder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When recipients press Enter or click the mouse on the URL in
the email, they will be redirected to a web page. The title of this page will
say the name of the file or folder, and the name of your default web browser.
Exact steps for downloading the file or folder change periodically when Dropbox
revises its website. As of the writing of this book, after landing on the web
page, press B several times to navigate to the Download button and press Enter.
The file or folder will now be downloaded to your PC’s Downloads folder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you have shared a folder, the name of the folder will
have a.zip extension. All folders that you download from the Internet have this
extension. This is called a Zip file. If recipients press Enter on the zip
file, they will now have access to all the folders and files contained in the
shared folder. They can open them here. They can also copy or move them
elsewhere on their PC. But as mentioned above, none of their actions will
affect the folders and files on your own computer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can also edit the hyperlink so that the shared file or
folder downloads directly to the recipient’s Downloads folder. This saves them
time. It also saves you the effort of having to explain how to perform the
download from the Internet if they don’t know how to do it already. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat steps one through three above for copying and pasting the
hyperlink.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your cursor focus anywhere on the URL that you pasted in the draft
email message. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to Edit hyperlink and press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This lands you in an edit field prepopulated with the URL. Press the
Right arrow once to deselect the URL and place your cursor focus at the right
side of the edit field. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If you Left arrow a couple of times, you hear that the URL ends with
“=0,” minus the quotes.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Delete the 0, replace it with 1, and press Enter. This places you back
in the email message. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Place your focus on the URL and listen to your screen reader to verify
that it now ends with 1. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Send the email message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When email recipients press Enter on the URL, the file or
folder will download directly to their Downloads folder.</p>

<span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'><br clear=all
style='page-break-before:always'>
</span>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal> 10.2.2.2 OneDrive</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To share without editing rights in OneDrive:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In your OneDrive folder, place cursor focus on the file or folder you
wish to share.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to Share, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab several times to the Copy link button and press Enter. This
generates a hyperlink and places it on the Clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the body of an email message, paste the link from the Clipboard by
pressing Control V. A URL appears.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Send the email message to those recipients with whom you wish to share
the file or folder. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When recipients press Enter on the URL in the email, they
will be redirected to a web page. The title of this page will say the name of
the file or folder, and the name of your default web browser. As with Dropbox,
exact steps for downloading the file or folder change periodically. As of the
writing of this book, steps were:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After landing on the web page, Down arrow several times to the Download
menu. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter or the Spacebar to expand it. The download process should
immediately begin. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As with Dropbox, the file or folder will now download to
your PC’s Downloads folder. Folders will have a.zip extension, and can be
accessed in the same way as with Dropbox. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, unlike with Dropbox, there is no way to
simplify the downloading process by editing the URL. </p>

<h3>10.2.3 Sharing Collaboratively</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Use this sharing method for team projects where you need to
work collaboratively, jointly editing files and storing folders in a place
where all team members can access and revise them. All those granted permission
to edit files and folders must have Dropbox or OneDrive accounts. While these
processes are accessible, they can be a bit finicky and may require a bit of
Tabbing and Shift Tabbing around to gain focus on the field where you insert
recipient email addresses. My experience is that Dropbox tends to be more
finicky than OneDrive when it comes to adding recipient emails. Also remember
that recipients must have Dropbox or OneDrive accounts for this to work. Check
with them before sending a request to collaborate. </p>

<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>10.2.3.1 Dropbox </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>To share folders collaboratively with others:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In your Dropbox folder, place cursor focus on the folder you wish to
share.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to Share, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in the Contact name edit field. However, you may not hear this.
Tab and Shift tab back to it to verify. Type in the email addresses of those
you want to share with. If you are going to share with several people, it may
be better to type the email addresses in Word first, and then copy and paste
them into this edit field because text editing works poorly here. Be sure to
type a semi-colon between email addresses if you intend to share with multiple
recipients. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Can edit combo box. “Can edit” is the default. This means
that those you share with can edit files and folders within the shared folder,
including adding and deleting files and subfolders, revising and renaming them,
and commenting. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, Down arrow to the second choice in the combo box, which is “can
view, download, and comment.” If you Up or Down arrow in this combo box, press
the Spacebar to make the selection. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span>Tab to the Share button and press Enter. You may or may not hear a
confirmation that the file or folder has been shared. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are a recipient of a request to share with editing
rights, you will receive an email message with a link. Do the following to add
the folder to your Dropbox.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on the link which brings you to a web page whose title is
the name of the file or folder being shared and the word “Dropbox.” </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press B several times to navigate to the Add to Dropbox button and press
Enter or the Spacebar.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>This opens a dialog that simply says “dialog.”</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the Add to Dropbox button and press Enter. You may or may
not hear a confirmation that the folder has been added to your Dropbox.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Dropbox folder on your PC where it should now appear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To share folders collaboratively with others:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In your OneDrive folder, place cursor focus on the file or folder you
wish to share.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to Share, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Shift Tab back to hear it. Type in the email addresses of those you want to
share with. Be sure to place a semi-colon between email addresses if you intend
to share with multiple recipients. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Can edit combo box and Down arrow to your choice. The two
options are: can edit, delete, comment, and add the folder to their Dropbox; or

</span>Tab to the Send button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you receive this type of sharing request, steps for
downloading it to your OneDrive folder are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on the link in the message. This will bring you to a web
page where the list of files in the folder appears.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From the top of the page, Down arrow to where you hear the folder name,
followed by the Folder is shared button, and press the Applications key. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Add to my OneDrive and press Enter. </p>

</span>Tab to the Add to my OneDrive button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The folder should now appear in the OneDrive folder on your
PC. As with Dropbox, these steps may change as the website is updated. </p>

<h3>10.2.4 Sharing with Other Apps On Your Smartphone</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you install the Dropbox and OneDrive apps on your
smartphone, these will synchronize with your Dropbox and OneDrive folders on
the PC. Not only can you access these files and folders there, but you can
export them to, or import them from, other apps on your smartphone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is beyond the scope of this book to provide detailed
instructions on how to use the Dropbox and OneDrive smartphone apps, as well as
for popular apps used in conjunction with them. However, below is a short
discussion of some of my favorite iPhone apps with links to iPhone App Store
pages where you can find out more about them. </p>

<h4>10.2.4.1 RecUp </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Developed by Irradiated Software, this app costs only $1.99.
It’s easily the best two bucks I’ve ever spent! RecUp is an easy-to-use voice
recorder that automatically uploads MP3-formatted audio recordings to a folder
in Dropbox (but only Dropbox). You can listen to the recordings on your phone
or on your computer. I can efficiently manage uploaded files on my computer,
deleting, renaming, and moving them elsewhere. The quality of the audio is also
quite good. Find out more at:</p>

- Record to the Cloud on the App Store</a></p>

<h4>10.2.4.2 Voice Dream Reader</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Developed by Voice Dream LLC, the price of this app is
$19.99. You can import files in various text and audio formats (Word, PDF, MP3,
WAV, and several others). You can also download books from Bookshare. While it
is possible to read or listen to files directly in Dropbox or OneDrive,
navigation is more flexible with this app. You can also adjust the voice rate
of audio files in Voice Dream. This is not possible in Dropbox and OneDrive.
The developer is very attuned to accessibility concerns. Find out more at:</p>

Dream Reader on the App Store</a></p>

<h4>10.2.4.3 Outlook</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Developed by Microsoft, this app is free for all users. It
includes both email and calendar functions. After many years of using the
iPhone’s native Mail ap, I switched over to Outlook in late 2020 and prefer it
for several reasons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Procedures are more straightforward for exporting attached
files to Dropbox or OneDrive, as well as for attaching files to messages I am
preparing. I also prefer the mail and calendar interfaces over the iPhone’s
native apps. For details, go to:</p>

Outlook on the App Store</a></p>

<h4>10.2.4.4 Cloud Music App Pro</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Developed by Mymacapps.com, this app costs $3.99. It is an
easy to use alternative to iTunes and the iPhone’s native Music app for syncing
music stored in my Dropbox and OneDrive folders (it also supports other cloud
storage apps). Syncing steps are straightforward, and playlists are
automatically created by artist and album. It is completely Voiceover
accessible, and on those rare occasions when I have contacted the developers
about problems, they were very responsive.</p>

<h2>10.3 Additional Useful Features in Windows and Office</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In this section, I cover some great features that you can
use in the various Office applications to enhance your productivity. </p>

<h3>10.3.1 Tell Me with Alt Q</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>For any of the Office Suite products, if you have difficulty
remembering shortcut keys, or wish to execute a seldom-used command, you can
press Alt Q to open a search box where you can search for a command (think of
the Q as standing for “question” or “query”). Type in the name of the command
you are searching for and Down arrow through the results. If you press Enter on
one of these, you can start the process of executing the command. For example,
if you are in a Word document, press Alt Q, type in “margins,” Down arrow to
the Adjust margins submenu, and press Enter. This opens the same submenu found
in the Layout tab of the ribbons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can do several other things with the Tell me feature.
Still using the margins example, continue Down arrowing to the Get help on:
margins split button. Pressing Enter on this opens a help page where you can
learn more about this and related commands. If you press Alt Down arrow on this
split button, a list of associated commands appear. You can press Enter on one
of these to open a help page related to that command. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If instead of executing the command, you want to add it to
the Quick Access toolbar (see the section immediately after this one), after
Down arrowing to it, you can press the Applications key and press Enter on Add
to Quick Access toolbar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, if you press Alt Q and leave the search box empty,
you can Down arrow through a short list of recent queries you have made and
execute one of those. </p>

<h3>10.3.2 Quick Access Toolbar</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Quick Access toolbar (QAT) allows you to assign
shortcuts for Office commands that are hard to remember or involve more
keystrokes than you prefer to type, especially if you use the command often.
The QAT is present in all the Office Suite programs, as well as with Windows File
Explorer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The QAT can be customized in each of these applications.
Shortcuts initially set by Microsoft can be deleted and new ones can be added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I’ll continue with Outlook to discuss how to navigate to the
QAT, delete existing QAT shortcuts, and add new ones. To navigate to the QAT,
press Alt, and then Shift Tab once. You land on the <span style='line-height:
107%'>Ribbon display submenu. Right arrow once and you land on the first QAT
shortcut, which is assigned Alt 1, the next one to the right is assigned as Alt
2, and so on. You can set a maximum of ten QAT shortcuts per program (up to Alt
0). </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Outlook comes with two preset QAT shortcuts: Send/receive
all folders (Alt 1) and Undo (Alt 2). Because easy-to-remember shortcut keys
exist for these two already (F9 and Control Z, respectively), I don’t find I
need them as QAT shortcuts. To delete a QAT shortcut:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the QAT by pressing Alt, and then Shift Tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow once to the first of these which has been assigned Alt 1. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key. You land on Remove from Quick Access toolbar.
Press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any QAT shortcuts to the right of the deleted shortcut will
move up one number. That is, the previously designated Alt 2 shortcut will
become Alt 1, Alt 3 will become Alt 2, and so on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Repeat the same steps if you want to delete other preset QAT
shortcut assignments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can add new QAT shortcuts in two ways: through the
ribbons and through the Customize Quick Access toolbar submenu. One QAT
shortcut I like to assign in Outlook is the command for changing the sort order
of inbox messages. Without a QAT shortcut, this involves either navigating to
the command in the Lower ribbon of the View tab, or memorizing the ribbon shortcut
key combination of Alt V A B F to sort by sender, and Alt V A B D to return to
sorting by date. To assign a QAT shortcut for this command:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, and Right arrow to the View tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab in the Lower ribbon to the Arrange by button, but do not press
Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key. You land on Add to Quick Access toolbar.
Press Enter on this.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A QAT shortcut is now designated for this command. If you
removed the two presets mentioned above, this becomes the new Alt 1 QAT
shortcut. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now if you want to sort your inbox by sender, all you have
to do is press Alt 1 F (for “from”). To return to sorting by date, press Alt 1
D. With JAWS, to make the QAT shortcuts work correctly, you must press the Alt
and 1 keys separately. Pressing them at the same time will not work. For
example, if you press them together while in Outlook, JAWS will say,” that
field is not available outside an open message.” With NVDA and Narrator, it is
OK to press the Alt and number keys together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can use the Customize toolbar submenu to assign QAT
shortcuts for a number of commands. In Outlook, I have found it useful to do
this for emptying the Deleted items or Trash folder. Using a QAT shortcut is
much faster than navigating to this command via the ribbons. To assign this QAT
key:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to the QAT by pressing Alt, and then Shift Tab.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow to the Customize toolbar submenu and press Enter to open it.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Empty deleted items and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This command is now assigned a QAT shortcut, Alt, plus one
additional number above the highest number already assigned. When you press the
QAT shortcut to empty the Deleted items folder, you will be asked to confirm
that you want to empty it. Press the Spacebar on the Yes button to confirm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Below are some additional commands for which you may wish to
assign QAT shortcuts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Attaching files in Word, Excel and PowerPoint to an email
message: Assign the QAT shortcut from within any of these programs via the
Customize toolbar submenu. In the submenu, Down arrow to Email and press Enter.
This command allows you to attach a file while in the window for that file,
provided that it has already been saved. When you execute this command, you
will land in the To field of your default email program. The file will already
be attached and the Subject field will be pre-populated with the file name. All
you need to do is address the message, add text to the message body and send
it. You can edit the Subject field if you like. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Create shortcut command in Windows 10 File Explorer: See
Chapter 2.8.1 to read about this command. To assign it a QAT shortcut:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in a folder such as Documents, navigate to the Home tab on the
Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the New item button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on Add to Quick Access toolbar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you activate the QAT shortcut, Down arrow once to
Shortcut and press Enter to open the relevant dialog.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Copy Path command in Windows 10 File Explorer: If you have
selected a single file or folder, or multiple ones, you can copy the full file
path to the Clipboard and then paste it in Word or some other text editor. To
assign it a QAT shortcut:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in a folder such as Documents, navigate to the Home tab on the
Upper ribbon.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Copy path button.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on Add to Quick Access toolbar.</p>

<h3>10.3.3 AutoText in Word and Outlook</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Among other things, this is a handy tool for quickly
inserting text that you otherwise type repetitively. Think of how many times
during the day you might type a salutation to a co-worker or friend, or
sign-off at the end of an email message. On any given day, I write several
messages beginning with “Hi all” followed by a comma. And at the end I sign off
with “Thanks” or “Best regards” followed by a comma, and my first name on the
next line. Rather than type these over and over again, you can speed all this
up by using the AutoText tool in Word and Outlook. You will need to define a
piece of AutoText separately in each of these two applications. I will use
Outlook as an example to add “Hi all comma” to AutoText. Note that I wrote out
the word “comma” just now so it is clear here in the text, but you will
actually type the comma symbol immediately after the text, exactly as you would
in an email message. Steps are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Outlook, press Control N to start a new message and Tab to the body
of the message.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in “Hi all comma” as you normally would.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select this text.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F3 which lands you in the Create new building block edit
field. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type in a letter or small number of letters that you can easily
remember, for example, just a lower case h, and press Enter. This is not
case-sensitive, so just stick with lower-case letters. Your AutoText and its
corresponding keystroke, or keystrokes, are now defined. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From now on, when you want to insert this text in the body
of an email, type h immediately followed by F3, and the text will appear. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is no character limit on the amount of text you can
select for Autotext. For example, you might use Autotext for quickly inserting
the Zoom link for a recurring meeting, the agenda for a weekly office meeting,
your email signature, or the boilerplate text for a newsletter. The only
limiting factor is your ability to remember the keys you assign to your
Autotext entries. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps are exactly the same for creating AutoText entries in
Word. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is easy to replace an Autotext entry with something else.
For example, let’s say that in Outlook, I want to redefine my h entry of “Hi
all comma” as “Hello all comma.” Repeat steps one through four above, but this
time in step two, typing in and selecting the text “Hello all comma.” When you
press Alt F3 to get into the Create new building block edit field, type in h,
and then Enter, you will be asked “do you want to replace the building block
entry?” Press the Spacebar to confirm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you later decide to delete an AutoText entry, or you just
want to see the list of AutoText entries you have created in either Word or
Outlook, they are found in the Quick parts gallery in the Insert tab of the
ribbon. For Outlook, you must first be in the body of an email message you are
currently preparing. Only then can you access the Quick parts submenu. Again, I
will use Outlook as an example.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Outlook, press Control N to start a new message and Tab to the body
of the message.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt, Right arrow once to the Insert tab, Tab to the Quick parts
submenu and press Enter (shortcut is Alt N Q).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Enter on the AutoText submenu. This opens the list of your
AutoText entries, listing the keystrokes you have created.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to the entry you want to delete.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the Applications key, Down arrow to Organize and delete, and press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Delete button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I first discovered this tool, I went nuts creating
scores of AutoText entries for everything from the name of my state blindness
agency and workplace, to my bank account routing number and checking account
numbers, to the titles and web addresses of previous books I have written. But
over time, I have dropped most of these from my daily habits and come to use
AutoText most frequently for email salutations and sign-offs. In any event, use
AutoText for whatever segments of text work best for you. </p>

<h3>10.3.4 Password-Protecting a File </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>With Microsoft Office, you can protect a file by creating a
password for it. This works for Word, Excel and PowerPoint files. Steps for
doing this are:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While in the file, press Alt to open the ribbons, Left arrow to the File
Tab, Down arrow to the Info tab and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Protect document submenu, and press Enter. The shortcut for
getting here is Alt F I P.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Encrypt with password and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You land in an edit field. Type in a password for the file and press
Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You are asked to confirm the password. Type it in again and press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Escape to return to the workbook or main body of the document. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Save the file if you have not already done so, or press Control S to
save it with this revision, now updated with password protection.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>8.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To be sure it works, press Alt F4 to exit the file and then reopen it.
You are prompted to enter the password. Type it in and press Enter. You are now
in the file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Be sure to choose a password that you can remember. If you
forget it, you are completely out of luck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After protecting a file with a password, you can change the
password by getting back into the file and repeating the steps above. You can
also remove password protection by returning to the edit field where you first
entered the password, deleting the text, pressing Enter, and saving the revised
file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As you may know, there are many password manager
applications on the market, some paid and others free. Popular examples are
1Password which carries a modest monthly subscription fee, and KeyPass which is
free. All of these applications have several common characteristics, including:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You are required to create a master password which enables you to
open a secure vault where you can store usernames and passwords. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>They enable you to generate strong passwords with many
characters, combining upper and lower case letters, numbers and special
characters.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Your secure vault is stored online so it is automatically backed
up, not just saved locally on your computer.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>They can be used across multiple devices, including computers,
smartphones and tablets. With smartphones like the iPhone, you will need to
enable touch or face ID in order to quickly log in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While you may decide to use one of these applications, there
is a learning curve for getting accustomed to using them. As an alternative,
you can recreate all of the elements above by creating a password-protected
Excel or Word file where you store your usernames and passwords. Password
managers generate strong passwords by stringing together a bunch of random
characters. You can create a strong password yourself that you then copy and
paste into the password field of a login page. With Chrome and Edge, you can
save login information for some websites so you don’t have to retype these
credentials every time you log into a site.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>[9]</span></span></span></a>
For those sites where this does not work, you can open the password-protected
file and copy and paste the password, or you can generate a password that you
can remember, while still being a strong one. Strong passwords contain a mix of
upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you save your password-protected file in Dropbox,
OneDrive or some other file sharing cloud application, this stores them online.
And if you use an iPhone and enable touch or face Id, this will allow you to
log in to apps more easily. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This way, you can develop a do-it-yourself password
management system with a relatively flat learning curve. I have done this in
Excel with account names contained in column A, user ID’s in column B,
passwords in column C, and login page URL’s in column D.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Telling you about my strategy is not meant to discourage use
of password management applications, some of which have additional valuable features.
However, as a technology instructor, I have found it useful to demonstrate this
alternative to my trainees. For anybody with basic knowledge of Word, Excel,
and cloud sharing services like Dropbox or OneDrive, it takes just a couple of
minutes to learn this technique, versus the several hours required to get
comfortable with a password manager app. It is a quick and easy way to begin
transitioning out of the all too common bad habit of using the same password
for everything, frequently forgetting passwords, or having no password
management system at all. </p>

<h3>10.3.5 Windows and FS Clipboards</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you select text and then copy or cut it to the
Clipboard by pressing Control C or Control X, only the latest text selection is
placed on the Clipboard. With both Windows and JAWS, it is possible to place
multiple selections on the Clipboard so you can paste them elsewhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With Windows, you must first enable the Windows Clipboard as
follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Windows I to open Windows settings.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type “clipboard” in the search box, minus the quotes, Down arrow to
Clipboard settings, and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Save multiple items to the Clipboard toggle and press the
Spacebar to turn it on. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to Sync across devices. For privacy reasons, you may not want to
enable this.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Alt F4 to close the window. There is no OK button here. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To test out the Windows clipboard, open an existing Word
document and select and copy several items. Then open a new document and Press
Windows V. If you Up and Down arrow, a list of copied items appears in
chronological order, with the most recent one at the top of the list. Press
Enter on any of these to paste them into the new document. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unfortunately, you can only paste them one at a time. It is
not possible to paste all of them at once. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All the copied items remain on the Windows clipboard and
across multiple applications, (for example, Word and Excel). There are two ways
to clear the Clipboard. First, you can shut down the computer, or:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Windows V to open the Windows clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to any of the copied items.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the More button and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Down arrow to Clear all and press Enter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that text you copy to the Windows clipboard does not
retain any formatting from the original document. If you copy Excel formulas,
only values are retained. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the Windows Clipboard automatically retains all copied
items once you have enabled the feature, with JAWS, you have to append each
item to be retained. Items are copied to the FS Clipboard (this stands for
Freedom Scientific). The FS Clipboard only works in text editors. It does not
work in Excel. To append text to the FS Clipboard, first select text as you
normally would. Then press Insert Windows C. Now go to the destination and
press Control V to paste all the items on the Clipboard</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If, after appending items to the FS clipboard, you select
text and press the standard Control C, you will be asked if you want to
override what is on the FS Clipboard. If you press the Yes button, all items on
the FS clipboard will be cleared. You will now be back with the standard
clipboard where only the last item copied or cut is retained on it prior to
pasting. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note that you can only copy text to the FS Clipboard. It is
not possible to cut selections to it. </p>

<h3>10.3.6 Accessibility Checker </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Microsoft has a useful tool for flagging accessibility
issues for the Office Suite of products. It has been available for quite some
time for Word, Excel and PowerPoint, and only more recently for Outlook. Note
that this utility does not work with files with the older 1997/2003 Office
extensions (.doc,.xls and.ppt). If you are using such files, resave them with
the newer file extensions ending with X (.docx,.xlsx and.pptx).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To run the Accessibility Checker for Word, Excel, and
PowerPoint, press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, Right arrow to the Review tab,
Tab to the Check accessibility split button and press Enter. To use shortcut

<p class=MsoNormal>After activating the Accessibility Checker, you may first
land on the Keep the Accessibility Checker running while I work checkbox. Press
the Spacebar if you wish to do this. Tab to the Inspection results tree view.
If no accessibility issues are present in the file, this will be indicated.
Otherwise, a tree view appears with the accessibility issues encountered
grouped into three categories:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Errors: Content that makes the document difficult or impossible
to read and understand for persons with disabilities. A frequently-encountered
example is absence of descriptive text for a graphic in a PowerPoint slide or
chart in an Excel worksheet (referred to as “alternative text”). </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Warnings: Content that in most (but not all) cases makes the
document difficult to understand for persons with disabilities. An example is
text that is hard to read on a PowerPoint slide.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tips: Content that people with disabilities can understand but
that could be presented in a different way to improve the user’s experience.
One example is absence of headings in a Word document, thus impeding efficient
navigation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each accessibility issue appears at level 0 of the tree
view, along with how many instances of that problem have been identified. Each
specific instance of that problem is listed at level 1. If you simply want to
navigate to that point in your file, press Enter. You can also rectify the
problem within the Accessibility Checker. Below is a step-by-step example of
adding alt text to a PowerPoint image which previously had none:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After opening the PowerPoint presentation, press Alt R A 1 and Enter to

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Inspection results, and Down arrow to Missing Alternative
text in the tree view. This is categorized as an error. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right arrow to open level 1 of the tree view, and Down arrow to the

<h3>10.3.7 Dictation in Word and Outlook 365 </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are not a great typist, or want to prepare a short
Outlook message, Word document, or PowerPoint slide, try the Dictate feature.
Use it to quickly record notes or prepare a draft document. Provided that you
speak reasonably clearly, the results are impressive in terms of being
error-free. This feature is only available with an Office 365 license. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first time you use the Dictate feature in Word or
Outlook, you may need to navigate to it in the Home tab of the Ribbon menu. To
do this in Word, press Alt to open the Upper ribbon, Left arrow to the Home tab
if you are not already there, press Control Right arrow to move by group to the
Dictate button, and press the Spacebar to check it. In Outlook, your cursor
must be positioned in the body of a message you are preparing before you can
execute these steps. From now on, you can use the shortcut key which is Alt H
D.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With your cursor positioned in the location in the Word
document or Outlook message where you want to add text, press Alt H D to start
dictation. You should hear a chime. When you are finished dictating, press Alt
H D again to end dictation. You will not hear a chime at this point. Check if
your dictated text has been inserted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You can add punctuation marks by saying them. Among the most
common are: period, comma, question mark, new line, and new paragraph. For more
information about dictation and the full set of words you can say related to
punctuation and editing, check out this link from MS Office Support:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dictate-in-microsoft-365-eab203e1-d030-43c1-84ef-999b0b9675fe#:~:text=Dictation%20lets%20you%20use%20speech,presentations%2C%20or%20even%20slide%20notes">Dictate
in Microsoft 365</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To access the various dictation options, first dictate a few
words. Then press F6 several times to navigate to the Dictation settings
submenu, and press Enter to open it. Options include: auto-punctuation, a
profanity filter (checked by default), and a Spoken language submenu. If you
want to change your dictation language, open this submenu, Down arrow to the
language of your choice, and press Enter. English is the default language. If
you switch to another language, this will be your new default dictation language
until you return here to change it back again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you are finished changing Dictation settings, press
Escape to return to your document.</p>

<h2>10.4 Participating in Zoom Meetings</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Since the outbreak of the COVID pandemic in early 2020, Zoom
has become an indispensable tool for communicating in work, school, and social
settings. While there are several online platforms for such communication, Zoom
is by far the most popular. It is nearly 100 percent accessible and its
usability is unparalleled. It is beyond the scope of this book to give a full
presentation of Zoom’s capabilities. Discussion here is limited to keystrokes
for participating in zoom meetings. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The keystrokes below only work if you are situated in the
active Zoom meeting window. If you press Insert T, your screen reader will
either say “meeting controls,” or “Zoom meeting.” If it only says “Zoom,” this
means you are in the window for the desktop Zoom app, not the active meeting
window. The keystrokes below will not work if you are in the “Zoom” window. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are not currently in the active meeting window, press
Alt Tab until you get back to it. To get into that window more quickly, hold
down Control Shift and Alt together. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once you are in the active meeting window, you can Tab
through a dialog box to find the various controls, but it is more efficient to
use the following keystrokes instead. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt A - mute/unmute audio: In any Zoom meeting with a reasonably
large number of participants, you should always stay muted if you are not
speaking or do not plan on speaking soon. Unwanted background noise is
disruptive and irritating. It reflects poorly on the person who is unaware that
he or she is unmuted. You should frequently double-check your muted/unmuted
status to avoid this problem.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='page-break-after:avoid'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt V - toggle video on/off: With your video on, participants
will see whatever images your computer camera displays. If using a laptop, be
sure you know where the camera is located. It is usually near the top middle of
your screen, but not always. Verify with a sighted person that the screen is
properly tilted to focus on your face rather than on some other part of your
anatomy. Also be vigilant that nothing unsightly is visible in the background.
The camera typically displays a wider background image than you might imagine.
Horror stories abound on embarrassing images being picked up from people’s
cameras. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt Y - raise your hand: In large meetings hosts may ask you to
raise your hand to be acknowledged during pauses for discussion. You can press
Alt Y again to lower your hand if you no longer wish to be acknowledged. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt H - Chat: You can submit questions or comments during a
meeting in text format. Pressing this key combination opens a dialog box where
you first land in an edit field, (although your screen reader may not announce
it). Type in a message and press Enter to send your chat to all meeting
participants. Tab one more time to access a list of chats sent during the
meeting. The list is organized chronologically, with the earliest chat message
at the top of the list. Press Tab again to the To everyone button drop-down. To
send a chat to an individual rather than the entire group, press Enter here and
Down arrow to the participant to whom you would like to send a chat. Press
Enter, type in your text, and press Enter again to send it. To save a list of
chats sent during the meeting, continue Tabbing to The More chat options button
drop-down, and press Enter. If the host has enabled saving chats, you will land
on “Save chat.: Press Enter here and a text file will be saved in a folder
entitled “Zoom,” located in your Documents folder. The text file will be placed
in a subfolder for this meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt U - Participants list: You first hear the number of
participants currently on the Zoom call. You can then Down arrow through the
list, hearing the name of each participant, as well as information about their
status (muted/unmuted, video on/off, etc.). Your information is found at the
top of the list, followed by hosts and participants with raised hands. I
frequently go here to check my status and to see who else is on the call. It is
not always clear to me whether or not I am muted, so I often navigate here to
double-check.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt S - screen share: After pressing this keystroke, Tab several
times to the Share computer sound checkbox. Press the Spacebar to check this if
you want to share your computer audio, including your screen reader voice. Tab
several more times to the Share screen button and press Enter. To end screen
sharing, simply press Alt S again. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='page-break-after:avoid'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt R - Start and end local recording: If you are a meeting host,
use this keystroke to start and end recordings. If you are a participant, you
must ask the host for permission to record. After the meeting is finished,
recordings will be converted and saved to the same folder mentioned above for
chat text files.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt P - Pause and resume recording: You can pause and resume in
mid-recording using this keystroke. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Alt Q or Alt F4 - Leave meeting: If you are a participant, press
either of these two keystrokes, Tab to the Leave meeting button and press
Enter. If you are a host, continue Tabbing to the End meeting for all button
and press Enter to terminate the meeting. </p>

<h2>10.5 YouTube </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>YouTube is one of the most popular websites on the planet.
You can access videos and accompanying audio for just about any topic
imaginable. In this section, you can find some hints on how best to navigate
the website, helpful quick keys for playing videos, and an easy way to download
YouTube video and audio files to your PC. </p>

<h3>10.5.1 Navigating YouTube</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Searching for YouTube videos is quick and easy. There is
only a single edit field on the YouTube page. With JAWS, just press E and then
Enter to get into the search box. You can do this from anywhere on the page
because JAWS wraps back to the top of the page when pressing quick keys. NVDA
and Narrator do not wrap around, so press Control Home to start from the top of
the page. Then press E and Enter to get into the search box. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After typing in your search term, press Enter. Each search
result is a heading and a link, so press H until you get to the one you want to
play, and then press Enter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Here are a couple of hints. First, after typing in a search
term and pressing Enter, press Escape to be sure you are not still in the
search box. For some reason, after pressing Enter on your search, your cursor
sometimes remains in the search box. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Second, have Audio ducking enabled (see Chapter 8.1.5.5 on
how to do this with JAWS, 8.2.2 For NVDA, and 8.3.2 for Narrator). This will
make it easier to hear your screen reader keystrokes while the video is
playing. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While playing a video, there are a number of useful quick
navigation keys you can access. There are several ways to do this. I will only
describe what I consider to be the best ways to access the widest array of
useful controls. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once the video starts playing, Tab once or twice to the
first left/right slider related to moving through the video play time. With
JAWS and Narrator, use the following keystrokes:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Spacebar or K: Pause and resume playing.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Right/Left arrow: Move forward/back five seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Page Up/Down: Move forward/back one minute.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>1 through 9: Move to 10 percent through 90 percent mark.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Home/End: Move to beginning/end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To make the above keys work with Narrator, once you Tab into
the Left/right slider, you need to manually disable Scan mode by pressing
Insert Spacebar. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To adjust the volume of the video (and this will adjust
independently of the overall system volume of your computer), continue tabbing
to the second left/right slider, and use the following keystrokes:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Up/Down arrow: Raises/lowers volume by five percent.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Home: Mutes volume.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>End: Maximizes volume. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To slow down or speed up playback, continue tabbing to the
Settings button and press the Spacebar to expand it. Down arrow to the Playback
submenu and press Enter. Normal is the default speed. There are 25 percent
increments, ranging from 25 to 200 percent. Up or Down arrow to your choice and
press Enter to change the playback speed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, you can press Shift N to go to the next video.
However, I do not find that this works consistently. </p>

<h3>10.5.2 Downloading YouTube Videos with Pontes Media Downloader </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a free app for downloading and converting YouTube
videos. You can download the original file format, as well as convert to other
formats like MP3, WAV, and others. Any advertisements are not present in the
downloaded file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There are several versions of this software. It is
preferable to download version two rather than the newer version three. Version
two is more accessible and includes MP3 audio while version three does not. Download
the installation file to your Downloads folder at: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="https://softdeluxe.com/Pontes-Media-Downloader-2915442/download/">Download
Pontes Media Downloader Version 2</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although there is a checkbox with the option to create a
desktop shortcut for the program, this never works. After installing the
program, create a desktop shortcut using the steps outlined in Chapter 2.8.2.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Steps for downloading and converting a YouTube video are as
follows:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Search for and start playing a video on YouTube. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After it starts playing, press Alt D or F6 to get to the Address bar.
You should hear “http, etc.” The URL is already selected.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press Control C to copy the URL to the Clipboard.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Pontes Media Downloader app on your PC. You should land in the
URL field. Press Control V to paste the URL here.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab once to the Convert to combo box and Down arrow to your choice. A
single Down arrow brings you to MP3, and after you Down arrow there the first
time, focus tends to remain there in the future. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tab to the Download button and press Enter or Spacebar. File conversion
will start and percentages will be read. You will also hear when it is
finished.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph>7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Navigate to your Documents folder. During program installation, a folder
entitled “Pontes Media Downloader” was created. Open it where you will find the
file that you downloaded and converted. Press Enter on it and your default
music player app will play it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I should mention that, unfortunately, the download process
has slowed down considerably over the past several months. Perhaps the folks at
YouTube just don’t want people listening to their videos outside of their own
environment and have figured out a way to hamstring this app. </p>

<h2>10.6 When Things Go Wrong</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Technology is quirky. Things inevitably go wrong. I will
conclude this book by identifying some commonly encountered issues and possible
ways to address them. Here goes!</p>

<h3>10.6.1 JAWS or NVDA stops talking.</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am primarily a JAWS user and find that it frequently goes
silent. This might be because my personal laptop is rather old and it takes a
lot of juice to run JAWS together with other applications. However, all JAWS
users experience this problem from time to time. To get some speech back, first
try turning on Narrator by pressing Control Windows Enter. I like to say that
JAWS gets jealous easily, not wanting an uppity competitor to butt in on its
turf. Turning on Narrator often wakes up JAWS. If that doesn’t immediately get
JAWS talking, navigate to the Desktop and click on the JAWS icon, hopefully
getting JAWS back this way. If this works, then press Control Windows Enter
again to exit Narrator. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although not yet as versatile as JAWS and NVDA, I consider
Narrator an indispensable tool when things go wrong with the other screen
readers. I switch it on and off several times every day. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If attempting to activate Narrator fails to get speech back,
it’s probably time to power off the computer by holding down the Power button
until the computer is turned off. Then boot it up again to restore speech. </p>

<h3>10.6.2 You open a window that you know has content, but when you Down
arrow, you hear nothing. </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>If this happens in a Word document, first press Alt R W to
get a word count, just to doublecheck that text is present and that you have
not accidentally deleted it. Then close your screen reader program and reopen
it (see Chapter 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4 on how to close and open JAWS, NVDA, and
Narrator, respectively). This usually fixes the problem. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You also may try maximizing the window by pressing either
Windows Up arrow or Alt and the Spacebar together and then X. But turning JAWS
off and then on again pretty much always works.</p>

<h3>10.6.3 You receive the message “program not responding.” </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This most frequently happens to me with Outlook. I naturally
first try pressing Alt F4 to exit the program. I try other things too, like
pressing Escape. But invariably, the program does not close and I cannot resume
working in that application. Short of rebooting the computer, open the Task
Manager and close the program there. To do this, press Control Shift Escape
together, Down arrow to the offending program, Tab to the End task button, and
press Enter. Reopen the program, and it should now work correctly. If the
problem persists, it’s time to reboot the computer. </p>

<h3>10.6.4 You accidentally delete text.</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>In any application where you are in edit mode, immediately
press Control Z to undo your last keystroke. If you are working in Excel, and
press a wrong key in a particular cell, immediately press the Escape key.
Whatever you just typed will not replace previous cell content. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The above said, your best defense against losing substantial
amounts of work is to save files early and often. If you do this and then make
a serious editing mistake, just close your document without saving it, and
reopen it. The amount of work you lose will be minimal. </p>

<h3>10.6.5 A file does not open in the program you want it to open in.</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want to permanently change the default program for
opening this file type, see Chapter 2.5.7. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you want to open the file in an application other than
the default one, place your focus on the filename. Then press the Applications
key, Down arrow to the Open with submenu, and press Enter. Now Up or Down arrow
to the desired application and press Enter. </p>

<h3>10.6.6 I am having a problem but don’t know whether it’s an issue with my
screen reader, the application I am in, or with my own computer. </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>First try to narrow down the possibilities to isolate the
problem. This will help you to better articulate your problem if you need to
call tech support or post a question to a discussion list. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s say you experience a problem while using JAWS. Try
switching to NVDA or Narrator. If performance improves, chances are good that
the problem is with your initial screen reader. If nothing changes, the problem
is unrelated to your choice of screen reader.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you encounter a problem on a website, try switching
browsers. Here too, this might help you isolate it. If the problem first arises
using Google Chrome, try Firefox rather than Edge. Chrome and Edge are both
Chromium-based while Firefox is not, so there is a greater likelihood that
performance will be different. Also try switching screen readers. If the
problem persists regardless of which screen reader and/or browser you switch
to, then the problem almost certainly lies with the application itself or the
specific website. At this point, you may wish to contact customer support for
that application or website. You might also query a technology discussion list
to which you subscribe, asking if others have had similar problems, and if so,
what they did to resolve it. </p>

<h3>10.6.7 I open a web page and my screen reader remains silent. </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>First try refreshing the web page by pressing F5, and wait a
reasonable time for your screen reader to start telling you the number of
headings, links, and so on, that are present on the page. Also try maximizing
the page by pressing either Windows Up arrow or Alt and the Spacebar together
and then X. </p>

<h3>10.6.8 Quick key navigation fails to work on a web page.</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Let’s say you open a web page, and then press H to navigate
to the first heading, or you press E to get to the first edit box, but your
screen reader only says H or E. Try any of the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Press F5 to refresh the page to see if it correctly loads this
time. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You may have landed on the Address bar instead of the main body
of the web page. Shift Tab several times to see if you can get to the main body
of the page that way. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Toggle screen reader cursor modes off and on. With JAWS, press
Insert Z to toggle Virtual PC cursor mode on and off. Try Down arrowing to see
if you can now activate links. Press H to see if you can navigate by heading.
In some cases where accessibility problems exist, Down arrowing and pressing
Enter on a word or set of words that are not expressed as links or buttons may
activate them. If using NVDA or Narrator, press Insert Spacebar to toggle on

<h3>10.6.9 You can’t remember how to do something or want to figure out how to
do something you have never done before.</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before posting a message to a technology discussion list or
contacting tech support, try conducting an online search. You will be amazed at
how many things you can figure out by “Googling it.” The more precise you can
be in the wording of your search, the more likely you will be to find an
answer. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Keep in mind that many of the step-by-step instructions you
encounter will be written for sighted people. You will be told to drag this
from here to there, click on the red or green button, and various other things
of little or no help to screen reader users. YouTube demo presenters will fail
to describe what they are clicking on. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If keystroke combinations are identified, these are what you
want. If you are instructed to “right click” on something, this is the
equivalent of pressing the Applications key. If you are told to click on a
particular command in one of the Office applications, try to figure out how to
get there via the ribbon menus, or use the Tell Me feature of Office (see
Chapter 10.3.1 above). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Try subscribing to several assistive technology user
discussion lists. I find some of the lists managed by Groups.io especially
informative. Find out how to create an account at:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="https://groups.io/helpcenter/membersmanual/1/understanding-groups-io-accounts/creating-a-groups-io-account">Creating
a Groups.io account</a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Links to the home pages of some of the lists that I have
found informative include:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For JAWS: <a href="https://jfw.groups.io/g/main">main@jfw.groups.io</a>
and <a href="https://groups.io/g/jfw-users">jfw-users@groups.io</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For NVDA: <a href="https://nvda.groups.io/g/nvda">nvda@nvda.groups.io</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For Microsoft Office: <a
href="https://groups.io/g/office-accessibility">office-accessibility@groups.io</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For news about assistive technology for the blind: <a
href="https://groups.io/g/tech-vi">tech-vi@groups.io</a>. This is an
announce-only list rather than a discussion list. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>These home pages provide information on the subject matter
of the lists, numbers of members, previous discussion threads, and links for
subscribing and unsubscribing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If you are concerned about getting inundated with email
messages, you can set parameters on how you receive messages. Rather than
getting individual messages, I prefer receiving a daily digest from each list
with links to the various message threads. That way, I only get one message per
discussion list each day, and I can quickly see if a particular discussion
thread interests me. To specify your mode of email delivery, open the
Subscription link on a list’s home page. That page includes radio buttons where
you can choose among several email delivery options. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This glossary is arranged alphabetically with each entry
marked as a level four heading. Press Insert F6 for a list of Headings. Use
first-letter navigation to quickly navigate to an entry, and press Enter to
access the text. Many of these entries were drawn from an excellent website
that provides definitions of technology terms, <a href="https://techterms.com/">Tech
Terms.com</a>. Another good source for definitions of computer terms is <a
href="https://www.techopedia.com/dictionary">Techopedia.com Dictionary</a>.</p>

<h4>Address Bar </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A text field near the top of a browser window that displays
the URL of the current webpage. The URL, or web address, is the address of the
current page and automatically changes whenever you visit a new webpage. </p>

<h4>Alt Text (or Alternative Text)</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Descriptive text of a graphic image used to make it
accessible to screen reader users. </p>

<h4>Application Key</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A key that might be to the right of the Spacebar, depending

revenue from advertising. After clicking the advertisement, the user is
redirected to the advertiser's website.</p>

<h4>Basic Input/Output System <span style='line-height:107%'>(BIOS)</span></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A program pre-installed on Windows-based computers that the
computer uses to start up. The BIOS checks all your hardware connections and

minijacks, the size most headphones use. </p>

<h4>Spreadsheet</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A document that stores data in a grid of horizontal rows and
vertical columns. Rows are typically labeled using numbers, while columns are
labeled with letters. Individual row/column locations, such as C3 or B12, are

for identifying them.</p>

<h4>Tab Order</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The order in which items on a web page are brought into
focus when using the Tab Key for navigation. </p>

<h4>Taskbar </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bar that spans the bottom of the screen in Windows. It
contains the Start button on the left side and the System Tray on the right. It
also includes the current time on the far right side and can hold labels to
programs directly to the right of the Start button. Most of the Taskbar,
however, contains titles for open windows. Whenever you open a program or
window, it shows up in the Taskbar. When you click on a window title in the
Taskbar, that window will become active and appear in front of other open windows.
You can also cycle through the Taskbar items by holding the Alt key and
pressing Tab a few times.</p>

<h4>Title Bar</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A small strip that extends across the top of a window. It
displays the title of the window and typically includes the close, minimize,
and maximize buttons. In Windows, these buttons are on the right side of the
screen.</p>

<h4>Toolbar</h4>

<p>A set of icons or buttons that are part of a software program's interface or
an open window. When part of a program's interface, toolbars typically sit
directly under menu bars. Toolbars can also reside within open windows. For
example, web browsers include a toolbar in each open window with items such as
back, forward, and home buttons, and address fields.</p>

<h4>Touchpad</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also known as a trackpad, it is a flat control surface used
to move the cursor and perform other functions on a laptop computer. They
replace the functionality of a mouse and are designed to be controlled with
your fingers. By sliding a fingertip along the surface, you can move the cursor
on the screen. Some touchpads have two physical buttons below them, which
correspond to the left-click and right-click mouse buttons. </p>

<h4>Tree View </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A graphical control element that presents a hierarchical
view of information. Each item, or level, can have a number of subitems, or
lower levels (expressed as level one, two, three, etc.). An item can be
expanded to reveal subitems, if any exist, and collapsed to hide subitems.
These are most commonly encountered in file manager and email applications,
where they allow the user to navigate the folder and file system directories. </p>

<h4>Two-Factor Authentication </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A security measure requiring two forms of authentication to
access an account. It often works in combination with a username and password
to add an extra level of security. Common types of two-factor authentication
include: a four to six-digit code sent via text message to the user's mobile
phone; a one-time code sent via email to the user's email address; an
additional PIN or passcode required in addition to a username and password; or
a secret question and answer created by the user.</p>

<h4>Uploading</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Transferring data from a computer to the Internet. It is the
opposite of downloading. </p>

<h4>URL (Uniform Resource Locator)</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The address of a page or file on the Internet, consisting of
three elements. For the Carroll Center Store’s URL, which is https://carroll.org/store/,
these are: https:// – the URL prefix, which specifies the protocol used to
access the location; carroll.org– the domain name or IP address of the server;
and /store/ – the path to the page or file on the site.</p>

<h4>USB (Universal Serial Bus)</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The most common type of computer port used in today's
computers. They are used for connecting keyboards, mice, game controllers,
printers, scanners, digital cameras, removable media drives, and other external
devices.</p>

<h4>Virtual Cursor</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A JAWS term, this is a special cursor used only in specific
programs, the most common being web browsers and PDF viewers like Adobe Acrobat
Reader. When the Virtual Cursor is active, text cannot be edited. However, text
can be selected and copied to the clipboard, and links can be activated by
pressing Enter.</p>

<h4>Virus </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A deliberately harmful computer program designed to create
annoying glitches or destroy data. </p>

<h4>Virtual Viewer</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>In JAWS, a message window providing helpful information.
Help messages can be accessed for lists of JAWS and Windows keystrokes,
Screen-Sensitive Help, and several types of informational messages In Microsoft
Office applications </p>

<h4>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Part of a series of guidelines published by the Web
Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the main
international standards organization for the Internet. They are a set of
recommendations for making Web content more accessible, primarily for people
with disabilities.</p>

<h4>Web Server </h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A computer system that hosts websites. It runs software that
provides access to hosted webpages over the Internet. Most web servers are
connected to the Internet via a high-speed connection.</p>

<h4>Window</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>An area on the screen that displays information for a
specific program. This often includes the user interface as well as the program
content. They are used by most applications as well as the operating system
itself. A typical window includes a title bar along the top that describes the
contents of the window, followed by a toolbar that contains user interface
buttons. Most of the remaining area is used to display content.</p>

<h4>Windows Settings</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Windows Settings app is a part of the operating system
first introduced in Windows 8, and included in later versions of the operating
system. It is the central location for customizing, configuring, and updating
the operating system.</p>

<h4>World Wide Web</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Or “web” for short, is an interconnected system of public
webpages accessible through the Internet. It is not the same as the Internet,
but is one of many applications built on top of the Internet. First proposed by
Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, it consists of several components: the HTTP protocol
governing data transfer between a server and a client; a unique universal
identifier, called a URL (uniform resource locator); use of the HTML (hypertext
markup language) format for publishing web documents; and linking, or
connecting documents and resources through hyperlinks.</p>

One notable exception is the Downloads folder. By default, this folder is
sorted by date, with the most recently downloaded file or folder at the top  of
the list. I prefer this sort mode for downloads because I usually want to deal

As far as I know, the only accessible way to create forms is with Google Forms.
Google Forms is free, but you must have a Gmail account to access it. Forms are

In theory, you can also save passwords with Firefox but I have never figured
out a way to do this with a screen reader. A dialog to save passwords
frequently pops up, but I have never figured out a way to gain focus so I can
save my user IDs and passwords.</p>
