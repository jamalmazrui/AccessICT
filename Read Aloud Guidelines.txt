Read Aloud Guidelines

APPENDIX D: READ ALOUD GUIDELINES

Available at: https://portal.smarterbalanced.org/library/en/read-aloud-guidelines.pdf

When a student cannot access text-to-speech, an embedded resource available on the Smarter Balanced assessment, the student may be eligible to work with a test reader. A test reader is an adult who provides an oral presentation of the assessment text to an eligible student. The student depends on the test reader to read the test questions accurately, pronounce words correctly, and speak in a clear voice throughout the test. The test reader must be trained and qualified and must follow the Smarter Balanced Read Aloud Guidelines presented here. The guiding principle in reading aloud is to ensure that the student has access to test content.

On Smarter Balanced assessments, test readers are allowable across all grades as a designated support for mathematics stimuli and items and ELA items as appropriate (not ELA reading passages). Test readers are allowable for ELA reading passages in addition to items as a documented accommodation in all grades. Note that this accommodation is appropriate for a very small number of students (estimated to be approximately 1–2% of students with disabilities participating in a general assessment). For information on documentation requirements and decision-making criteria for use of test readers and all other Smarter Balanced resources, please see the Smarter Balanced Usability, Accessibility, and Accommodations Guidelines.

QUALIFICATIONS FOR TEST READERS

[]

u  The test reader should be an adult who is familiar with the student, and who is typically responsible for providing this support during educational instruction and assessments.

u  Test readers must be trained on the administration of the assessment in accordance with member policy and familiar with the terminology and symbols specific to the test content and related conventions for standard oral communication.

u  Test readers must be trained in accordance with Smarter Balanced and member administration, as well as security policies and procedures as articulated in Smarter Balanced and Consortium member test administration manuals, guidelines, and related documentation.

PREPARATION

[]

u  Test readers should read and sign a test security/confidentiality agreement prior to test administration.

u  Test readers are expected to familiarize themselves with the test environment and format in advance of the testing session. Having a working familiarity with the test environment and format will help facilitate reading of the test.

u  Test readers should have a strong working knowledge of the embedded and non-embedded universal tools, designated supports, and accommodations available on Smarter Balanced assessments.

u  Test readers should be aware of and familiar with all additional supports and/or accommodations provided to a student in accordance with the student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 plan. This will ensure that there are plans in place for providing all needed designated supports and accommodations.

u  In addition to a test reader, students may make use of any other approved specialized tools or equipment during the test as appropriate and in accordance with the Usability, Accessibility, and Accommodations Guidelines. Test readers should be familiar with any assistive technology or approved supports the student requires.

u  Test readers should have extensive practice in providing read aloud support and must be familiar and comfortable with the process before working directly with a student. 

u  The reader should be knowledgeable of procedures for reading aloud text by content area (see Table 1 below).

u  The test reader should meet with the student in advance and inform the student of the parameters of the support. A suggested test reader script is included at the end of the Read Aloud Guidelines.

u  Unless otherwise specified by a student’s IEP or 504 plan, the test reader does not have a role in manipulating the test or assisting with any other support tools. Test readers should be ready with appropriate script that reinforces the parameters during the test session.

GENERAL GUIDELINES

[]

u  The test reader’s support should ideally be provided in a separate setting so as not to interfere with the instruction or assessment of other students.

u  Read each question exactly as written and as clearly as possible.

u  Throughout the exam, strive to communicate in a neutral tone and maintain a neutral facial expression and posture.

u  Avoid gesturing, head movements, or any verbal or non-verbal emphasis on words not otherwise emphasized in text.

u  Avoid conversing with the student about test questions as this would be a violation of test security; respond to the student’s questions by repeating the item, words, or instructions verbatim as needed.

u  Do not paraphrase, interpret, define, or translate any items, words, or instructions as this would be a violation of test security.

u  Spell any words requested by the student.

u  Adjust your reading speed and volume if requested by the student.

POST-ADMINISTRATION

[]

u  The test reader must collect scratch paper, rough drafts, and login information immediately at the end of the testing session and deliver it to the test administrator in accordance with Smarter Balanced and Consortium member policies and procedures.

u  The test reader must not discuss any portion of the test with others.

ENGLISH USAGE/CONVENTIONS

[]

u  Punctuation: Read all text as punctuated, unless reading the text compromises the construct being measured.

u  Ellipses: When an ellipsis is used to signify missing text in a sentence, pause briefly, and read as “dot, dot, dot.”

u  Quotations: Quotation marks should be verbalized as “quote” and “end quote” at the beginning and end of quoted material, respectively.

u  Emphasis: When words are printed in boldface, italics, or capitals, tell the student that the words are printed that way. In order not to provide an unfair advantage to students receiving this support, test readers should be cautious not to emphasize words not already emphasized in print. Emphasis is appropriate when italics, underlining, or bold is used in the prompt, question, or answers.

u  Misspellings: In some cases, a test item may present a word or phrase that is intentionally misspelled as part of the assessment. In these instances, the student is required to respond in a specific way. When presented with intentionally misspelled words test readers should not attempt to read the word(s) aloud as pronunciation is somewhat subjective.

IMAGES/GRAPHICS/DIAGRAMS

[]

u  Before describing an image or graphic, the test reader should determine whether the details of the picture are necessary to understanding and responding to the item(s). In many cases, an image or graphic will be used to accompany a passage or reading excerpt as a piece of visual interest that is not essential in responding to the item. Typically, diagrams are imperative to student understanding and should be read in a logical order.

u  Describe the image/graphic/diagram as concisely as possible following a logical progression. Focus on providing necessary information and ignoring the superfluous. Use grade-appropriate language when describing the image/graphic/diagram.

u  Read the title or caption, if available.

u  Any text that appears in the body of the image/graphic/diagram may be read to a student. Read text in images/graphics/diagrams in the order most suited for the student’s needs. Often the reader moves top to bottom, left to right, in a clockwise direction, or general to specific in accordance with teaching practices.

PASSAGES

[]

u  Read the passage in its entirety as punctuated (e.g., pauses at periods and commas; raised intonation for questions). Do not verbalize punctuation marks other than ellipses and quotation marks as noted above.

u  If the student requires or asks for a specific section of the passage to be re-read with the punctuation indicated, the test reader should re-read those specific lines within the passage and indicate all punctuation found within those lines as many times as requested by the student.

u  When test questions refer to particular lines of a passage, read the lines referenced as though they are part of the item.

                 

MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS

[]

u  The test reader must read mathematical expressions precisely and with care to avoid misrepresentation for a student who has no visual reference. For mathematics items involving algebraic expressions or other mathematical notation, it may be preferable for the reader to silently read the mathematical notations or the entire question before reading it aloud to the student.

u  Test readers must read mathematical expressions with technical accuracy. Similar expressions should be treated consistently.

u  In general, numbers and symbols can be read according to their common English usage for the student’s grade level.

u  Additional examples may be found in the table below.

u  Abbreviations and acronyms should be read as full words. For example, 10 cm needs to be read as “ten centimeters.” Some abbreviations may be read differently by different readers. For example, cm³ may be read as “cubic centimeters” or “centimeters cubed.”

SUGGESTED TEST READER SCRIPT

[]

To be used with student in advance of the day of testing.

Hi [],

I'm the person who will be reading your test to you when you take your Smarter Balanced assessment next week in [math/ELA]. I wanted to let you know how we'll work together. When I'm reading a test to you, it's very different from when I'm reading to you during class time. I have to follow certain rules.

u  I cannot help you with any answers.

u  I cannot click on anything on the screen.^(^([1]))

u  I will not be using different character voices or changes in my tone when I read. I will be using a very direct voice that does not change very much, no matter how exciting the story or test item gets.

u  If there is a picture that has words in it, I will read those words. If you ask, I will re-read the words as well.

u  Sometimes there may be something about a word or phrase that might give you a hint if I read it out loud. In those cases, I will skip the word, point to it on screen [**or on your booklet if braille or print on demand], and continue to read.

u  I can still help you with your [**list any assistive technology that the student may require that would need adult support—if that support is provided by you].

u  You can ask me to re-read parts of the test if you didn't hear me or need more time to think.

u  You can ask me to pause my reading if you need to take a break.

u  You can ask me to slow down or speed up my reading, or read louder or softer, if you are having trouble understanding what I read.

u  I will only read certain types of punctuation, but if you need me to re-read a sentence and tell you how it was punctuated, I can do that.

u  If you ask me a question about the test all I will say is: "Do your best work. I cannot help you with that."

u  Do you have any questions for me about how we’ll work together during the test?
