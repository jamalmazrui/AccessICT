<p>Most business leaders would agree that reaching the broadest audience
is good for a business’s bottom line. A good portion of that audience
will be people with disabilities. How, though, would an organization go
about ensuring it is as accessible as it can be to all its potential
clients or customers, including people with disabilities?</p>
<p>This resource has been created to answer this question and to
demystify “digital accessibility” as a business practice. It brings
together all the pieces of the digital accessibility picture and
provides strategies and resources that will help make digital
accessibility a part of an organization’s business culture.</p>
<p>This resource is an adaptation of the massive open online course
(MOOC) of the same name, developed through The G. Raymond Chang School
of Continuing Education at Ryerson University and offered through the
Canvas Network. To see when the course will be offered next, <a
href="https://de.ryerson.ca/wa/business" target="des"
rel="noopener noreferrer">check the course website</a>.</p>
<p>Though the resource originates in Ontario, Canada, and includes some
discussion of the <em>Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities
Act</em> (AODA), the content will be relevant to a global audience.
Accessibility as it applies to AODA and Ontarians applies equally in
other jurisdictions, albeit perhaps in some cases without the motivation
of the law to enforce it as a requirement. Many are watching Ontario as
it rolls out its 20-year plan to make the province the most accessible
jurisdiction in the world.</p>
<p>Though the learning materials here are aimed at educating business
leaders and managers about digital accessibility as a business practice,
it will be of interest to anyone who wants to understand organizational
culture in general and how digital accessibility fits into that culture.
What you’ll learn here goes well beyond accommodating people with
disabilities or adhering to the law. It is about improving your bottom
line and ensuring your business or organization is able to serve its
whole audience — not just those who are able bodied or using the latest
technology, but also those from the margins of society, who are often
overlooked by the mainstream. Being a good “corporate citizen” and
“doing the right thing” are phrases often used to justify making an
effort to remove potential barriers to goods and services, but it’s more
than that.</p>
<p>The business arguments for accessibility are many. They are about
reaching the broadest audience possible. People with disabilities have
family and friends, who will go elsewhere if together they are unable to
effectively access your business’s website or digital content. When you
consider that people with disabilities make up nearly 15% of the
population (<a
href="https://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report/en">WHO</a>),
and when you include their mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters,
aunts and uncles, and more, that number can reach 50% of the population
who are affected by disability in one way or another. Most businesses
would have a hard time justifying serving only 50% of their potential
customer base.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Digital accessibility is good for business.</p>

<strong>Key Point:</strong> Though this resource has some focus on web
accessibility as it pertains to those who reside in Ontario, Canada,
most of what is covered here will be relevant regardless of where you
are in the world. Where we do provide Ontario-specific information, use
it as an opportunity to compare what Ontario is doing with the efforts
in your country or region.

<h2>Managers</h2>
<p>This resource is aimed primarily at those who are responsible for
implementing accessibility at an organizational level. These people tend
to be <strong>managers,</strong> but may also be accessibility
specialists, whose role it is to oversee the implementation of
accessibility strategies and awareness throughout an organization.</p>
<h2>Web Developers</h2>
<p>Web developers may also wish to read the materials here to expand
their understanding of the organizational aspects of implementing
accessibility, thereby extending their role to that of an IT
accessibility specialist, who is often the person to lead the
implementation of accessibility culture in an organization.</p>
<h2>Everyone Else</h2>
<p>While managers and web developers are the primary audience here,
anyone who has an interest in the aspects of implementing accessibility
culture in an organization will find the materials informative.</p>

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
<p>Though the instruction here has been developed without much of the
technical details of accessibility, there are places throughout the
content where important technical information has been included. These
details are contained in the blue Technical boxes. It’s a good idea for
those managing web accessibility efforts to be aware of some key
technical elements of implementing digital accessibility, so they
understand what technical staff should know.</p>

understand what they should be doing to meet the organization’s
accessibility requirements.</p>
<p>The following is a list of potential sections for the policy
document. You can start with these and make the following changes and
additions: add or remove sections or subsections; provide text for each
section explaining the what, how, and/or who the section of the policy
applies to; and organize it in a coherent way.</p>

navigating by keyboard, and follow it to jump directly to the main
content of the page.</li>
<li>Links to external sites will always open in a new window.</li>
<li>Use your screen reader’s list headings feature to navigate through
the headings within the content of a page.</li>
<li>Use the “Previous Section” and “Next Section” links found at the
bottom of each page to navigate through the sequence of pages. To access
these links most easily, use your screen reader’s landmarks list to jump
to the navigation region, then press Tab and Shift-Tab to move between
the next and previous links.</li>
<li>Depending on the operating system and browser being used, font size
can be adjusted by pressing a key combination including the plus (+) and
minus (-) keys. On Windows systems, this is typically “CTRL+” and on Mac
“Command+”.</li>

<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />The
narrative here revolves around the story of “The Sharp Clothing Company”
who recently received a complaint about the accessibility of their
online store, which included a threat to take legal action if the
company does not address the issue in a reasonable amount of time. This
complaint came as a surprise to the company, who thought they were
compliant with local accessibility laws, having recently retrofitted
several of their retail locations to accommodate wheelchair access.
However, they did not consider digital accessibility.</p>
<p>The company currently has twelve stores across Ontario and Quebec
located primarily in shopping malls, and a distribution centre where
clothing imported from around the world is distributed to physical
stores and out to customers purchasing online. The head office is
located in central Toronto.</p>
<p>The company has been growing rapidly, opening about two new stores
per year since going public in 2012, with 222 people currently employed,
across a broad range of roles. The company is making plans to expand
into international markets in the coming year.</p>
<h3>Other Company Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Business: Sales and distribution of economical clothing</li>
<li>Established: 2002 and publicly traded since 2012</li>
<li>Union status: Non-unionized</li>
<li>Annual revenue in 2016: $46.5 million</li>
<li>Marketing channels: Social media, website, television, newspapers,
billboards, and print catalog</li>
</ul>
<h3>Employees</h3>
<p>Total number of employees: 222</p>
<ul>
<li>8 senior managers</li>
<li>6 middle managers (at head office and distribution centre)</li>
<li>16 office staff</li>
<li>4 cleaning and maintenance staff</li>
<li>12 store managers</li>
<li>12 assistant store managers</li>
<li>100 in-store sales staff</li>
<li>8 communications and marketing staff</li>
<li>5 web developers</li>
<li>2 mobile app developers</li>
<li>2 user experience designers</li>
<li>5 web content authors</li>
<li>4 purchasers/buyers</li>
<li>8 24-hour telephone and online help staff</li>
<li>6 media support staff (videographer, photographer, and graphic
artists, etc.)</li>
<li>24 distribution centre staff</li>
</ul>
<h3>Your Role</h3>
<p>The complaint that was filed ended up with the company’s CEO. She has
come to you to handle the issue and tasks you to ensure that this type
of complaint does not happen again. You already have a little background
in accessibility, but it is primarily around customer service and design
of physical spaces to accommodate people with disabilities. You gained
this experience as the project manager during the company’s efforts to
make its stores accessible to people with disabilities. However, you
have little experience with “digital accessibility” and have a limited
technical background.</p>
<p>Your goal is to educate yourself about digital accessibility and
implement a plan to address the complaint to ensure no other similar
complaints occur. You have a budget which might cover hiring one or two
additional staff members, training staff, updating technology, and
launching promotional activities to raise awareness of digital
accessibility throughout the company.</p>
<p>You will be working closely with other managers and specific staff in
order to bring the company into compliance with digital accessibility

<p>In 2011 and 2012, Karl Groves wrote an interesting series of articles
that looked at the reality of business arguments for web accessibility.
He points out that any argument needs to answer affirmatively to at
least one of the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li>Will it make us money?</li>
<li>Will it save us money?</li>
<li>Will it reduce risk?</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>He outlines a range of potential arguments for accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved search engine optimization:</strong> Customers will
be able to find your site more easily because search engines can index
it more effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Improved usability:</strong> Customers will have a more
satisfying experience, thus spend more or return to your site more
often.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced website costs:</strong> Developing to standard
reduces bugs and interoperability issues, reducing development costs and
problems integrating with other systems.</li>
<li><strong>People with disabilities have buying power:</strong> They
won’t spend if they have difficulty accessing your site; they will go to
the competition that <em>does</em> place importance on
accessibility.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced resource utilization:</strong> Building to standard
reduces use of resources.</li>
<li><strong>Support for low bandwidth:</strong> If your site takes too
long to load, people will go elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Social responsibility:</strong> Customers will come if they
see you doing good for the world, and you are thinking of people with
disabilities as full citizens.</li>
<li><strong>Support for aging populations:</strong> Aging populations
also have money to spend and will come to your site over the less
accessible, less usable competition.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced legal risk:</strong> You may be sued if you prevent
equal access for citizens/customers or discriminate against people with
disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>What accessibility really boils down to is “quality of work,” as
Groves states. So, in approaching web accessibility, you may be better
off not thinking so much in terms of reducing the risk of being sued, or
losing customers because your site takes too long to load. Rather, the
work you do is quality work, and the website you present to your
potential customers is a quality website.</p>

<p>For readers from Ontario, Canada, we’ll provide occasional references
to the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). If
you’re studying here to work with accessibility outside Ontario, you may
compare AODA’s web accessibility requirements with those in your local
area. They will be similar in many cases and likely based on the W3C
WCAG 2.0 guidelines. The goal in Ontario is for all obligated
organizations to meet the Level AA accessibility requirements of WCAG
2.0 by 2021, which, ultimately, is the goal of most international
jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The AODA provided the motivation to create this resource. All
businesses and organizations in Ontario with more than 50 employees (and
all public sector organizations) are now required by law to make their
websites accessible to people with disabilities (currently Level A).
Many businesses still don’t know what needs to be done in order to
comply with the new rules, and this resource hopes to fill some of that
need.</p>
<p>The AODA was passed as law in 2005, and, in July of 2011, the
Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation (IASR) brought together
the five standards of the AODA, covering information and communication,
employment, transportation, and design of public spaces, in addition to
the original customer service standard.</p>
<p>The AODA sets out to make Ontario fully accessible by 2025, with an
incremental roll-out of accessibility requirements over a period of 20
years. These requirements span a whole range of accessibility
considerations, including physical spaces, customer service, the web,
and much more.</p>
<p>Our focus here is on access to information, information technology
(IT), and the web. The timeline set out in the AODA requires government
and large organizations to remove all barriers in web content between
2012 and 2021. The timeline for these requirements is outlined in the
table below. Any new or significantly updated information posted to the
web must comply with the given level of accessibility by the given date.
This includes both internet and intranet sites. Any content developed
prior to January 1, 2012 is exempt.</p>

<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />The
Sharp Clothing Company recently completed upgrading all of its premises
to include wheelchair access ramps, accessible washrooms,
wheelchair-height customer service desks, and so on. The management was
confident everything was done to meet accessibility standards, so they
were surprised to receive a customer complaint about the company’s
online store being completely inaccessible by keyboard.</p>
<p>You have been asked to investigate the issue. After looking into the
complaint you are surprised to find that there were many different types
of disabilities and each one with its own accessibility challenges. You
decide you need to learn more about how people with different
disabilities use the web and digital information, since you see now
there is more to accessibility than providing access for wheelchair
users.</p>
</div>
<p>To understand where accessibility issues can arise, it is helpful to
have a basic understanding of a range of disabilities and the related
barriers found in digital content. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>people who are blind</li>
<li>people with low vision</li>
<li>people who are deaf or hard of hearing</li>
<li>people with mobility-related disabilities</li>
<li>people with learning or cognitive disabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all people with disabilities encounter barriers in digital
content, and <strong>those with different types of disabilities
encounter different types of barriers</strong>. For instance, if a
person is in a wheelchair, they may encounter no barriers at all in
digital content. A person who is blind will experience different
barriers than a person with limited vision. Many of the barriers that
people with disabilities encounter on the web are often barriers found
in electronic documents and multimedia. Different types of disabilities
and some of their commonly associated barriers are described here.</p>

experience the Internet.</p>

<h2><span
id="chapter-011-types-of-disabilities-and-associated-barriers.xhtml_#blind"></span>People
who Are Blind</h2>
<p>People who are blind tend to face the most barriers in digital
content, given the visual nature of much digital content. They will
often use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">screen reader</a> to access
their computer or device, and may use a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refreshable_braille_display"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">refreshable Braille
display</a> to convert text to Braille.</p>
<p>Common barriers for this group include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual content that has no text alternative</li>
<li>Functional elements that cannot be controlled with a keyboard</li>
<li>Overly complex or excessive amounts of content</li>
<li>Inability to navigate within a page of content</li>
<li>Content that is not structured (i.e., missing proper headings)</li>
<li>Inconsistent navigation</li>
<li>Time limits (insufficient time to complete tasks)</li>
<li>Unexpected actions (e.g., redirect when an element receives
focus)</li>
<li>Multimedia without audio description</li>
</ul>
<p>For a quick look at how a person who is blind might use a screen
reader like JAWS to navigate the web, watch the following video.</p>

<h2><span
id="chapter-011-types-of-disabilities-and-associated-barriers.xhtml_#lowvision"></span>People
with Low Vision</h2>
<p>People with low vision are often able to see digital content if it is
magnified. They may use a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_magnifier"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">screen magnification</a>
program to increase the size and contrast of the content to make it more
visible. They are less likely to use a screen reader than a person who
is blind, though in some cases they will. People with low vision may
rely on the magnification or text customization features in their web
browser or word processor, or they may install other magnification or
text reading software.</p>
<p>Common barriers for this group include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content sized with non-resizable absolute measures</li>
<li>Inconsistent navigation</li>
<li>Images of text that degrade or pixelate when magnified</li>
<li>Low contrast (inability to distinguish text from background)</li>
<li>Time limits (insufficient time to complete tasks)</li>
<li>Unexpected actions (e.g., redirect when an element receives
focus)</li>
</ul>
<p>See the following video for a description of some of the common
barriers for people with low vision.</p>

<h2><span
id="chapter-011-types-of-disabilities-and-associated-barriers.xhtml_#deaf"></span>People
who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing</h2>
<p>Most people who are deaf tend to face barriers where audio content is
presented without text-based alternatives, and encounter relatively few
barriers in digital content otherwise. Those who are deaf and blind will
face many more barriers, including those described for people who are
blind. For those who communicate with American Sign Language (ASL) or
other sign languages (e.g., langue de Signes Quebecoise or LSQ), the
written language of a website may produce barriers similar to those
faced when reading in a second language.</p>
<p>Common barriers for this group include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio without a transcript</li>
<li>Multimedia without captions or transcript</li>
<li>Lack of ASL interpretation (for ASL/Deaf community)</li>
</ul>
<h2><span
id="chapter-011-types-of-disabilities-and-associated-barriers.xhtml_#mobility"></span>People
with Mobility-Related Disabilities</h2>
<p>Mobility-related disabilities are quite varied. As mentioned earlier,
one could be limited to a wheelchair for getting around, and face no
significant barriers in digital content. Those who have limited use of
their hands or who have fine-motor impairments that limit their ability
to target and click elements in digital content with a mouse pointer,
may not use a mouse at all. Instead, they might rely on a keyboard or
perhaps their voice to control movement (i.e., <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">speech recognition</a>)
through digital content along with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">switches to control mouse
clicks</a>.</p>
<p>Common barriers for this group include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clickable areas that are too small</li>
<li>Functional elements that cannot be controlled with a keyboard</li>
<li>Time limits (insufficient time to complete tasks)</li>
</ul>
<h2><span
id="chapter-011-types-of-disabilities-and-associated-barriers.xhtml_#learning"></span>People
with Learning or Cognitive Disabilities</h2>
<p>Learning and cognitive-related disabilities can be as varied as
mobility-related disabilities, perhaps more so. These disabilities can
range from a mild reading related disability, to very severe cognitive
impairments that may result in limited use of language and difficulty
processing complex information. For most of the disabilities in this
range, there are some common barriers, and others that only affect those
with more severe cognitive disabilities.</p>
<p>Common barriers for this group include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of overly complex/advanced language</li>
<li>Inconsistent navigation</li>
<li>Overly complex or excessive amounts of content</li>
<li>Time limits (insufficient time to complete tasks)</li>
<li>Unstructured content (no visible headings, sections, topics,
etc.)</li>
<li>Unexpected actions (e.g., redirect when an element receives
focus)</li>
</ul>
<p>More specific disability-related issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading: Text justification (inconsistent spacing between
words)</li>
<li>Reading: Images of text (not readable with a text reader)</li>
<li>Visual: Visual content with no text description</li>
<li>Math: Images of math equations (not readable with a math
reader)</li>
</ul>
<h2><span
id="chapter-011-types-of-disabilities-and-associated-barriers.xhtml_#everyone"></span>Everyone</h2>
<p>While we generally think of barriers in terms of access for people
with disabilities, there are some barriers that impact all types of
users, though these are often thought of in terms of usability.
Usability and accessibility go hand-in-hand. Adding accessibility
features improves usability for others. Many people, including those who
do not consider themselves to have a specific disability (such as those
over the age of 50) may find themselves experiencing typical age-related
loss of sight, hearing, or cognitive ability. Those with varying levels
of colour blindness may also fall into this group.</p>
<p>Some of these usability issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link text that does not describe the destination or function of the
link</li>
<li>Overly complex content</li>
<li>Inconsistent navigation</li>
<li>Low contrast</li>
<li>Unstructured content</li>
</ul>

ensure physical accessibility at the storefront locations, you are eager
to gain an understanding about how accessibility legislation may extend
into the digital realm. The added risk of potential legal action and
reference to a human rights violation in the complaint has drawn concern
from the company’s leadership. They have asked you to investigate
further into what legislation might already exist with reference to
digital accessibility.</p>
<p>You discover that, in fact, there is legislation in place in Ontario
as part of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA),
specifically <strong>Section 12</strong> and <strong>Section 14</strong>
that speak to digital accessibility, which cover accessible formats and
web content, respectively. You see that, indeed, accessible websites are
addressed in Section 14(4).</p>

</ul>
<p>While you are reading about the AODA Information and Communications
Standard, you remember the discussion at the last manager’s meeting,
about the plan coming together that will see several new stores open
over the next year, located in the United States, the European Union,
and Australia. It occurs to you that these countries may have their own
digital accessibility standards, and that you should look into those
while learning about the local accessibility requirements.</p>

<h2>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</h2>
<p>The W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20" class="external"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines</a> (<strong>WCAG 2.0</strong>) has become broadly accepted
as the definitive source for web accessibility rules around the world,
with many jurisdictions adopting it verbatim, or with minor adjustments,
as the basis for accessibility laws that remove discrimination against
people with disabilities on the web.</p>
<p>While you do not need to read the whole WCAG 2.0 document, it is good
to have a basic understanding of what it covers.</p>
<div class="colorBox toolkit">

<h3>Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</h3>
<p>The materials here haqve been written in the context of the AODA,
which came into effect in 2005 with the goal of making Ontario the most
inclusive jurisdiction in the world by 2025. Part of this twenty-year
rollout involved educating businesses in Ontario, many of which are now
obligated by the Act to make their websites accessible, first at Level A
between 2012 and 2014, and at Level AA between 2016 and 2021.</p>
<div class="colorBox keyPoint">
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> AODA adopts WCAG 2.0 for its Web
accessibility requirements, with the exception of two guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ontario businesses and organizations are not required to provide
captioning for live web-based broadcasts (WCAG 2.0 Guideline 1.2.4,
Level A)</li>
<li>Ontario businesses and organizations are not required to provide
audio description for pre-recorded web-based video (WCAG 2.0 Guideline
1.2.5, Level AA)</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, AODA adopts WCAG 2.0 verbatim.</p>
</div>
<div class="colorBox toolkit">
<strong>Toolkit:</strong> For key information on the adoption of WCAG
2.0 in the context of the AODA, refer to the <a

<h3>Canadian Government Standard on Web Accessibility</h3>
<p>In 2011, the Government of Canada (GOC) introduced its most recent
set of web accessibility standards, made up of four sub standards that
replace the previous Common Look and Feel 2.0 standards. The Standard on
Web Accessibility adopts WCAG 2.0 as its Web accessibility requirements
with the exception of Guideline 1.4.5 Images of Text (Level AA) in cases
where “essential images of text” are used, in cases where “demonstrably
justified” exclusions are required, and for any archived Web content.
The standard applies only to Government of Canada websites.</p>

accessibility requirements read the <a

<h3>Accessibility 2024</h3>
<p>In 2014 the British Columbia government released <a
href="http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/accessibility"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accessibility 2024</a>, a
ten-year action plan designed around twelve building blocks intended to
make the province the most progressive in Canada for people with
disabilities. Accessible Internet is one of those building blocks. The
aim is to have all B.C. government websites meet WCAG 2.0 AA
requirements by the end of 2016.</p>
<h3>Canadians with Disabilities Act</h3>
<p>Currently a work in progress, this act intends to produce national
accessibility regulations for Canada. Visit the Barrier-Free Canada
website for more about the developing <a
href="http://barrierfreecanada.org/home" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">Canadians with Disabilities Act</a>, and the Government
of Canada on the <a

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consultation process</a>.</p>
<h2>United States</h2>
<h3>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h3>
<p>The ADA does not have any specific technical requirements upon which
it requires websites to be accessible, however, there have been a number
of cases where organizations that are considered to be “places of public
accommodation” have been sued due to the inaccessibility of their
websites (e.g., Southwest Airlines and AOL), where the defendant
organization was required to conform with WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA
guidelines.</p>
<p>There is a proposed revision to Title III of the ADA (Federal
Register Volume 75, Issue 142, July 26, 2010) that would, if passed,
require WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA conformance to make Web content
accessible under ADA.</p>

<h3>Section 508 (of the Rehabilitation Act, U.S.)</h3>
<p><strong>Section 508</strong> is part of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act
and its purpose is to eliminate barriers in information technology,
applying to all Federal Agencies that develop, procure, maintain, or use
electronic and information technology. Any company that sells to the
U.S. Government must also provide products and services that comply with
the eleven accessibility guidelines Section 508 describes in Section
1194.22 of the Act.</p>
<p>These guidelines were originally based on a subset of the WCAG 1.0
guidelines, and were recently updated to include WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA
guidelines as new requirements for those obligated through Section 508.
Though in effect as of March 20, 2017, those affected by the regulation
are required to comply with the updated regulation by <strong>January
18, 2018</strong>.</p>

<h2>United Kingdom</h2>
<h3>Equality Act 2010</h3>
<p>The Equality Act in the United Kingdom does not specifically address
how web accessibility should be implemented, but in Section 29(1),
require that those who sell or provide services to the public must not
discriminate against any person requiring the service. Effectively,
preventing a person with a disability from accessing a service on the
web constitutes discrimination.</p>
<p>Sections 20 and 29(7) of the Act make it an ongoing duty of service
providers to make “reasonable adjustments” to accommodate people with
disabilities. To this end, the British Standards Institution (BSI) <a
href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030180388"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provides a code of practice
(BS 8878)</a> on web accessibility, based on WCAG 1.0.</p>

<h2>Europe</h2>
<p>Throughout Europe, a number of countries have their own accessibility
laws, each based on WCAG 2.0. In 2010, the European Union itself
introduced web accessibility guidelines based on WCAG 2.0 Level AA
requirements. The EU Parliament passed a law in 2014 that requires all
public sector websites, and private sector websites that provide key
public services, to conform with WCAG 2.0 Level AA requirements, with
new content conforming within one year, existing content conforming
within three years, and multimedia content conforming within five
years.</p>
<p>This does not mean, however, that all countries in the EU must now
conform. The law now goes before the EU Council, where heads of state
will debate it, which promises to draw out adoption for many years into
the future, if it gets adopted at all.</p>

levels of government, private firms that are licensees of public
services, public assistance and rehabilitation agencies, transport and
telecommunications companies, as well as ICT service contractors.</p>
<p>The Stanca Act has 22 technical accessibility requirements originally

which require all government websites to conform with WCAG 1.0 Priority
2 guidelines. More recently, UNE 139803:2012 adopts WCAG 2.0
requirements and mandates that the following types of organizations
comply with WCAG Level AA requirements: government and government-funded
organizations; organizations larger than 100 employees; organizations
with a trading column greater than 6 million Euros; or organizations
providing financial, utility, travel/passenger, or retail services
online.</p>

<h3>Australia</h3>
<p>Though not specifically referencing the web, section 24 of the
Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 makes it unlawful for a person who
provides goods, facilities, or services to discriminate on the grounds
of disability. This law was tested in 2000, when a blind man
successfully sued the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games
(SOCOG) when its website prevented him from purchasing event
tickets.</p>
<p>The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC)
shortly after released the World Wide Web Access: Disability
Discrimination Act Advisory Notes. These were last updated in 2014, and,
while they do not have direct legal force, they do provide web
accessibility guidance for Australians on how to avoid discriminatory
practices when developing web content, based on WCAG 2.0.</p>

requires buy-in from senior management. These managers may not always
understand the implications of accessibility barriers on the company.
Using the knowledge you have gained to this point, write an elevator
pitch to convince a senior manager that accessibility is important to
the company.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with elevator pitches, they often unfold when
you, the speaker, getting on the elevator, happen to run into a key
senior person in the company, who typically spends her day running from
meeting to meeting. You have her as a captive audience for one minute
while the elevator ascends. This is the only opportunity you will have
to pitch your idea to this person, and if you succeed in convincing this
person, she will support you in your effort.</p>
<p>Your task in this activity is to convince one of the following people
that digital accessibility is very important and you have a good idea
that is sure to benefit the company. You may want to consider different
arguments to convince different people.</p>
<ul>
<li>President/Chief Executive Officer</li>
<li>Director of Marketing</li>

<p>If your organization has more than a handful of employees, or has
multiple groups or departments that serve different purposes within the
organization, it is helpful to recruit staff to represent and speak for
each group on an Accessibility Committee (or whatever you choose to call
it). These will typically be comprised of people in senior positions,
people with influence, and employees with disabilities. These committee
members must be willing to sell the ideas put forth by the committee to
raise awareness and affect the culture within the group they
represent.</p>
<p>You will probably also want to assign a person to be in charge of the
whole committee: A person we will refer to as the Accessibility
Champion. This person should have expertise in the accessibility area,
be able to lead, manage change, and oversee the organization’s
accessibility efforts as a whole.</p>

<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />Having
learned about how people with disabilities use digital content and the
Web, and knowing about the local and international digital accessibility
regulations, you now want to determine what led to the customer’s
complaint in the first place.</p>
<p>The person who submitted the complaint has identified that he is
blind and uses a technology called a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">screen reader</a> to access
content on the Web. From your research on how people with disabilities
use the Web, you know that screen readers read out the text content from
web pages.</p>
<p>The complaint mentions two particular issues. First, many images in
the shopping area of the company’s website are announced as file names,
such as “rt-004.jpg”, rather than something meaningful like “add to
shopping cart.” You discover the problem is the result of images in the
shopping cart application not having a text description. You know that
“alt text” is the way to provide a text description for images on the
Web.</p>
<p>Second, the buttons in the shopping cart cannot be activated with a
key press; rather, they require a person to click the buttons with a
mouse. Since people who are blind typically cannot use a mouse (not
being able to see a mouse pointer), you have learned that they usually
rely on their keyboard to navigate through content and to press buttons
or activate links. When these website elements cannot be accessed or
operated with a key press, they are inaccessible to anyone who relies on
a keyboard to navigate.</p>
<p>You first approach the content developer who set up the products in
the shopping cart application, and ask that she go through the product
list and add the missing text descriptions. But, she tells you the
shopping cart editor does not have a way to add text descriptions, or
alt text, for product images.</p>
<p>You then approach your company’s web developer to see if it is
possible to add an alt text field to the editor used to add product
images. As it turns out, the shopping cart application is a third-party
proprietary application, and, apart from simple changes to brand the
shopping cart, there is little that can be done to make changes to the
editor without going back to the vendor. You also ask your web developer
about the keyboard access problem, and he tells you this cannot be
modified either without going back to the vendor.</p>
<p>You wonder how the company ended up purchasing this shopping cart
application given its limited accessibility support. The next stop in
your investigation is your purchasing department. You ask about the
accessibility requirements that were included with the request for
proposals (RFP), and discover that no accessibility requirements were
outlined in the RFP. The purchasing department did not know about the
requirement to purchase accessible technologies when they are
available.</p>
<p>Through this investigation, you begin to realize that accessibility
knowledge needs to be weaved through many roles in the company. The next
area you focus on is understanding what types of digital accessibility
knowledge is needed for various roles in the company, and the potential
training that might be needed to ensure various roles understand their
accessibility responsibilities.</p>
<p>The roles you identify include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retail store staff</li>
<li>Retail store managers and assistant managers</li>
<li>Web developers</li>
<li>Web content editors</li>
<li>Communications and marketing staff</li>
<li>Procurement and purchasing staff</li>
<li>Telephone support staff</li>
<li>Video support staff</li>
<li>Graphic artists</li>
<li>Senior managers and directors</li>
<li>Human resource staff</li>
<li>Distribution centre staff</li>
<li>Office support staff</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Depending on a person’s role in a company, different types of
accessibility knowledge may be needed. The following is an example of
the different knowledge various roles may need, though depending on the
size of a company and the nature of the business, this knowledge could
be adapted across roles. For instance, if a company does not have a
human resource (HR) department, then knowledge of accessible hiring
practices and accessibility knowledge requirements for various roles may
shift to senior managers responsible for hiring new staff.</p>
<p><strong>Retail store staff:</strong> Since retail staff often do not
use digital tools or content beyond perhaps a web-based checkout, the
main focus of their knowledge should be disability sensitivity, so they
are able to interact comfortably and appropriately when people with
disabilities are shopping in the retail stores.</p>
<p>People are often unsure how to interact with a person with a
disability, if they have little experience with it. They may feel
uncomfortable and wary of saying the wrong thing. In general, people
with disabilities should be treated like anyone else, though this may be
difficult for some, for instance, who have never met a person who is
blind or deaf or uses a wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>Retail store managers and assistant managers:</strong> Like
other retail store staff, store managers should also receive disability
sensitivity training, and they should be able to provide training to
other store staff.</p>
<p>Managers should also have a general overview of the business’s
accessibility requirements as a whole, so they are able to identify and
potentially resolve any accessibility issues they may encounter through
the day-to-day retail store operation.</p>
<p><strong>Web developers:</strong> The company’s web developers play a
key role in ensuring that the company’s public website, in particular,
meets accessibility requirements. They should have a good understanding
of the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</a>, in addition to having expert knowledge of
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. WCAG is the international guideline for
developing accessible web content and is the basis for many
international web accessibility regulations.</p>
<p>A web developer may also be a good person to oversee the company’s
digital accessibility efforts, as they have a good understanding of the
technologies involved and the ability to evaluate and remediate
accessibility issues. An accessibility lead should have both
understanding of accessibility technology, and an understanding of
disability and related accessibility barriers. This combination of
expertise can be difficult to find, so it would be more effective to
educate a web developer on disability and accessibility issues than
training a disability expert on the technical aspects of implementing
digital accessibility.</p>
<p><strong>Web content editors:</strong> Those who develop the content
for a website should have basic understanding of WCAG 2.0, though they
typically do not need the level of understanding that web developers
need. Among the many potential accessibility issues in digital content,
web content editors should be aware of things like including text
descriptions for images, structuring content with the proper use of
headings, and creating links in content that describe in a meaningful
way where the link leads.</p>
<p><strong>Communications and marketing staff:</strong> Marketing staff
should also have the basic understanding of WCAG that content editors
have, though there are some other guidelines that may be relevant, such
as effective use of colour when developing promotional materials (e.g.,
having sufficient contrast between foreground and background and
ensuring that colour alone is not used to represent meaning).</p>
<p>Marketing staff may also produce documents that are distributed both
internally and externally to the public. They should also have an
understanding of how to use accessibility features in various document
authoring tools such as Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat Pro, among
others. Most current document authoring tools should have features for
testing and authoring accessible documents. Upgrades may be necessary to
take advantage of those features, if older software is still being
used.</p>
<p><strong>Procurement and purchasing staff:</strong> Those who buy
products and resources for a company need to have a good understanding
of WCAG 2.0, or at a minimum understand that when purchasing, software
in particular, and choosing between comparable products, the more
accessible one should be purchased. Purchasing agents may make use of
third party accessibility evaluation services to report on the
accessibility of potential purchases. The company’s web developers may
also be a good source for evaluators, assuming they have acquired the
necessary expertise with WCAG.</p>
<p>Procurement staff also need to know how to ask for accessibility
features from vendors and how to critically evaluate the responses to
those requests, ensuring vendors are being honest about the
accessibility of their products. Some vendors may tell you what you want
to hear, which may not necessarily be the whole truth, while others may
not know about accessibility, which is a good indication that there
products are not accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Telephone support staff:</strong> These staff should have
similar disability sensitivity training, though typically, unless a
person identifies themselves as having a disability, they may not be
aware of such facts. Nonetheless, if they are interacting with a person
they know to have a disability, they need to know how to interact in an
acceptable way.</p>
<p>Telephone support staff should know how to use a TTY (Teletype or
Teletypewriter), used by people who are deaf to communicate with hearing
individuals by phone. If your support services do not include TTY
access, telecommunications providers can typically provide the
service.</p>
<p><strong>Video support staff:</strong> Video production editors need
to know about captioning and audio description. Captioning provides
access to the audio track in multimedia content for those who are deaf,
and audio description provides access to meaningful visual elements or
activity in a video that are not obvious by listening to the audio
track, for those who are blind.</p>
<p><strong>Graphic artists:</strong> Similar to marketing staff, graphic
artists need to be aware of the basic WCAG guidelines and issues around
the use of colour.</p>
<p><strong>Senior managers and directors:</strong> The senior people in
a company need to have a basic understanding of digital accessibility as
a whole, as well as a good understanding of the accessibility
regulations that govern a business’s accessibility requirements. They
also need to be open to change and to understand the business arguments
for creating an inclusive business. Ultimately, it is the senior
management  in a company that make or break a company’s accessibility
efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Human resource staff:</strong>  HR staff need to have a good
understanding of the local accessibility laws, and related accessible
hiring practices. They also need to know about the required
accessibility knowledge for the roles described here, as well as other
potential roles. HR staff also need to be able to ask the right
questions to determine, for instance, if a web developer has expertise
with WCAG, or to perhaps assess the marketing department or office
personnel’s understanding of accessibility features in the authoring
tools they use.</p>
<p>HR staff may also be responsible for training efforts. While having
accessibility knowledge for a given role should give applicants an
advantage over others, in reality it is often difficult to find
candidates with both expert understanding of the job they are being
hired for, and knowledge of accessibility elements for that role.
Fortunately, for many roles, accessibility training is often quick, like
training office staff to use PDF accessibility features. With a few
hours of training, staff can acquire all the skills they need to get
started creating accessible content. However, for other roles, like web
developers, it can take a significant amount of training and time to
develop their expertise.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution centre staff:</strong> These staff members may
need little accessibility training. These people may include inventory
control staff, a shipper/receiver, truck drivers, or a warehouse
manager, among others. They may have no interaction with the public, and
may not be involved in activities that produce digital content, but
should be aware of their company’s accessibility obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Office support staff:</strong> These staff members are likely
to use various document authoring tools, and should be aware of, and
use, the accessibility features tools such as Microsoft Word and Acrobat
Acrobat Pro provide.</p>

<div class="colorBox caseStudy">
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76"
height="76" />Understanding the diversity of skills and knowledge in the
company’s workforce, you decide that it will be more effective if each
department managed their own digital accessibility efforts. You decide
to create an accessibility committee, made up of senior or influential
people from each of the major groups in the company. Your goal is to
take a proactive approach to accessibility, addressing issues before
they become complaints, rather than a reactive approach, where issues
are addressed only when a complaint has been received.</p>
<p>By implementing a proactive approach, you are aiming to address
potential barriers before they result in lost customers. While the
company did receive a complaint, you understand that many people who
encounter accessibility barriers do not complain. They just leave,
perhaps going to the competition. You are convinced that if they come to
your website and have a pleasant, accessible experience, they will
likely return and make additional purchases.</p>
<p>You plan to have the accessibility committee initially meet several
times over a two month period, to get accessibility efforts underway,
then reduce the frequency of meetings to once per quarter, to receive
updates from each group and discuss any new issues that arise.</p>
</div>
<h2>Who Should be on the Committee?</h2>
<p>Ideally the Accessibility Committee (AC) should be made up of
influential and knowledgeable representatives from different areas of
the company, starting with a senior executive who can affect the
company’s accessibility policy. In Figure 2.1, the CEO at the top of the
organizational structure would be that person, though it does not
necessarily need to be the company’s top officer.</p>
<figure>
<img src="OEBPS/assets/ac_structure.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-232" width="625" height="332"
alt="Organization chart, showing CEO, accessibility champion below, then representatives from organizations within the company." />
<figcaption>Figure 2.1: A possible accessibility committee
structure<br />

Compliance</em>, Chapter 3: Implementing Accessibility in the
Enterprise. (Urban Burks, 2006)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Below the senior executive is the person who will oversee the
committee, in this case referred to as the “Accessibility Champion.”
This person should be in a relatively senior position, or have
substantial influence in the company, who has a good understanding of
accessibility, disability, and the technical aspects of implementing
accessibility. This person should also find accessibility interesting
and challenging, and should not be forced into the role. Depending on
the size of the company, it may be a person dedicated specifically to
overseeing the company’s accessibility efforts, or it could be someone
in another role who manages accessibility efforts on a part-time
basis.</p>
<div class="colorBox caseStudy">
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />You
debate whether you are the best person to take on the Accessibility
Champion role. While you are becoming more familiar with digital
accessibility, and you find it very interesting, you are not sure if you
have the technical knowledge to fully understand the possibilities or
options for developing and implementing digital accessibility. For now,
you take on the role yourself, but leave the option open to assign the
role to another member of the accessibility committee once it has been
established, or even look outside the company for a person with the
right balance of technical background and disability/accessibility
knowledge to understand the technologies involved.</p>
<p>You decide to approach the CEO, who originally asked you to
investigate the complaint, and ask her if she would be a member of the
committee. She agrees, but suggests that after initially establishing
the committee, she will pass that role to the senior VP. You also
approach the director of retail sales, who oversees the retail managers
and visits retail stores regularly. You also ask the IT manager to
participate, as well as one of the senior web developers who reports to
him and who has some web accessibility experience.</p>
</div>
<h3>Accessibility Committee Members</h3>
<ul>
<li>CEO (president)</li>
<li>You (project manager)</li>
<li>Director of retail sales</li>
<li>IT manager</li>
<li>HR manager</li>
<li>Senior web developer</li>
<li>The senior VP (oversees operations at head office)</li>
<li>Director of marketing (oversees the video editors and graphic
artists)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other members of the accessibility committee are strategically
selected from throughout the company, with the aim of including
representatives across all areas of the company where digital
accessibility is a concern, as well as those known to be knowledgeable
on the subject of digital accessibility, which may include people within
the company who have disabilities.</p>
<h2>Accessibility Committee Goals and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Clear goals for the accessibility committee should be defined and
promoted throughout an organization so that everyone understands the
committee’s function.</p>
<p>The accessibility committee should be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising accessibility awareness</li>
<li>Encouraging feedback to share problems and solutions</li>
<li>Implementing quality assurance procedures</li>
<li>Consulting on legal matters related to accessibility</li>
<li>Providing web and digital accessibility support</li>
<li>Developing internal accessibility standards</li>
<li>Representing the organization in accessibility-related public
affairs</li>

<p>The Accessibility Champion will be the person who leads an
organization’s accessibility efforts. The title may vary from
organization to organization, though the role will be the same.</p>
<p>The Accessibility Champion should be able to relate to others at
their level. For instance, when working with developers to promote
accessibility practices, being able to talk to them with appropriate
technical language will help get the message across convincingly.
Similarly, when working with designers, this person should be able to
talk in terms of Universal Design and Inclusive Design practices.</p>
<p>Though an Accessibility Champion does not necessarily need to have
formal computer science or design backgrounds, knowledge in these areas
is important to be effective in the role. At a minimum, the Champion
needs to be comfortable working with technology, and have a good
understanding of how people with disabilities access information and
digital content.</p>
<p>The Accessibility Champion should have a particular set of necessary,
and desirable characteristics, described here:</p>
<h2>Necessary Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Has the ability to lead</li>
<li>Can influence people at all levels of authority, and across all
roles</li>
<li>Has strong communication skills (verbal and written) and the ability
to motivate people</li>
<li>Is creative when faced with challenging situations</li>
<li>Can talk about disability issues in an informed way</li>
<li>Is familiar with a range of assistive technologies</li>
<li>Understands the societal effects of inclusion</li>
<li>Is passionate about inclusive design</li>
<li>Has a strong technical background</li>
</ul>
<h2>Desirable Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is able to teach</li>
<li>Is able to present convincingly to small or large audiences</li>
<li>Has a disability or is closely related to someone with a
disability</li>
<li>Is a software engineer, or programmer</li>
<li>Is a web developer</li>
<li>Is a user interface or interaction designer</li>
</ul>

Accessibility Culture Defined</h2>
<p>“Culture,” in the context of digital accessibility, refers to an
overarching consciousness or awareness throughout an organization of
potential barriers — barriers that may prevent people with disabilities
from participating in digital activities or consuming digital
information at the same level as their fully able peers.</p>
<p>It means that attention to accessibility is weaved into an
organization’s processes and integrated with quality assurance, so, when
products and services are evaluated, accessibility is part of that
evaluation. Everyone who is involved in producing products or delivering
services has accessibility in mind while they carry out their duties.
They know how to address accessibility in their work, and, if they
encounter potential barriers they are not sure of, they ask questions,
perhaps, addressing questions to accessibility experts on staff or to
the Web or third-party experts to search out answers. In short, they
will persevere until they find a solution.</p>
<p>Developing digital accessibility culture requires buy-in from the
most senior executive in an organization. That buy-in trickles down
through an organization, influencing senior managers, who influence
junior managers, who influence the staff reporting to them, and so on,
flowing all the way down the organizational hierarchy.</p>
<p>This culture, by way of its adoption throughout an organization,
becomes a practice that guides business activities in designing and
developing new products, to production, to service delivery, to
marketing and communications, to procurement, to hiring, and more. All
aspects of the organization are influenced by attention to digital
accessibility inclusion.</p>

<div class="colorBox caseStudy">
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />One of
the the accessibility committee’s first tasks is to determine where the
company is in terms of its compliance with accessibility guidelines and
to identify gaps where improvements are needed. Since you do not have an
accessibility expert on staff, you decide to look into firms that
provide accessibility auditing services.</p>
</div>
<h2>Choosing an Accessibility Auditor</h2>
<p>Unless there is already an accessibility expert on staff,
organizations likely want to hire a third-party auditor or find a person
to hire on as one.</p>
<p>It is typically easier to find an auditing service than to find an
accessibility expert to hire. Depending on the size of the company, and
the amount of digital information it produces, you may or may not want
to hire a permanent accessibility person.</p>
<p>Finding a reputable auditing service can also be a challenge. With
the growing public awareness of accessibility issues, there are a
growing number of so-called accessibility experts popping up, taking
advantage of the market for these services that has emerged with this
awareness. You want to evaluate these auditor services to ensure their
reputability.</p>
<p>Factors you might take into consideration when selecting an
accessibility service could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of years the service has been in business (the longer the
better)</li>
<li>The clients they have served (potential references)</li>
<li>The accessibility of the service’s website (dead giveaway to search
elsewhere, if their site is not accessible)</li>
<li>Whether their process aligns with <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">accessibility auditing best practices</a> (not
required, but advisable)</li>
<li>Whether they provide self-service tools (most good firms provide
automated test tools)</li>
<li>Whether accessibility auditing is their primary business (be wary of
firms offering accessibility auditing as an add-on service for an
unrelated primary business)</li>
<li>Whether they offer training (the ability to train your staff is a
good sign)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a number of reputable international services, so companies
do not necessarily need to choose a local auditor. Since most
accessibility regulations are based on WCAG, most international and
local services audit based on those guidelines (or they should).</p>
<h2>Self-Assessing</h2>
<div class="colorBox caseStudy">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />While
searching for an accessibility-auditing firm on the Web, you come across
a few accessibility-testing tools. Before you decide whether you need a
third-party accessibility auditing service, you want to understand what
you can do yourself with these tools to get a general sense of your
company’s accessibility status. You decide to do a little research on
tools that can be used to test/check accessibility. You find there are a
wide variety of free and commercial accessibility-testing tools.
</div>
<h3>Automated Accessibility Checkers</h3>
<p>There are quite a number of automated tools for testing web
accessibility with varying degrees of coverage and accuracy. Much like
choosing an accessibility auditor, choosing a good testing tool also
requires a little critical evaluation. You may refer to <a
href="https://alphagov.github.io/accessibility-tool-audit/index.html"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing evaluations of these
tools</a> and choose based on your needs. You may also want to adopt a
number of accessibility checkers that complement each other.</p>
<div class="colorBox tryThis">
<strong>Try This:</strong> Copy the URL of your organization’s website
and paste it into the <a href="https://achecker.ca/checker/index.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker Web Accessibility
Checker</a> to see how accessible your website is.
</div>
<p>Keep in mind that no automated accessibility checker can identify all
potential barriers. In most cases, some human decision-making is
required, particularly where meaning is being assessed. For example,
does an image’s text alternative describe an image accurately, or does
link text effectively describe the destination of the link? Both require
a human decision on the meaningfulness of the text.</p>
<div class="colorBox keyPoint">
<strong>Key Point:</strong> Automated accessibility-testing tools cannot
identify all potential barriers. A human must also be involved in
testing, making decisions where meaning is being assessed.
</div>
<p>There a number of different types of web accessibility checkers.
Depending on your needs, one type may serve your organization better
than others.</p>
<h3>API-Based Accessibility Checkers</h3>
<p>API stands for application programming interface. An API allows
developers to integrate the accessibility checker into other web-based
applications, such as web-content editors, to provide accessibility
testing from within the application. For instance, with a content
editor, the checker assesses the contents of the editor while creating
and editing content. <a href="https://tenon.io/documentation"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tenon</a> and <a
href="https://achecker.ca/documentation/web_service_api.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a> provide APIs that
can be used for integrations with other applications. To take advantage
of an API, a developer would need to create the integration in many
cases, though some applications may already have an integration with an
accessibility checker.</p>
<h3>Text-Based Accessibility Checkers</h3>
<p>Text-based checkers typically output a list of accessibility issues
it has identified; and, in some cases, provide recommendations to
correct those issues. Some checkers may also categorize issues based on
their importance or whether an issue is either a definite barrier or a
potential barrier, which would need to be confirmed by a person. Some
checkers evaluate single pages while others spider through a site and
produce a site-wide accessibility report. These checkers often ingest
one of the following: a URL of a web page, a user-uploaded HTML file, or
copied and pasted HTML code; then, they produce a report based on the
input provided. <a
href="https://achecker.ca/documentation/web_service_api.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a> is a good example
of a text-based accessibility checker, which also provides an API for
integrations.</p>
<h3>Visual Accessibility Checkers</h3>
<p>A third type of accessibility checker provides a visual presentation
of a web page, pointing out where the issues appear on a page. The <a
href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WAVE accessibility checker</a> is a good
example of a visual accessibility checker.</p>
<h3>Browser Plugin Accessibility Checkers</h3>
<p>Some accessibility checkers are available as a browser plugin, making
it easy, while viewing a web page, to click a button and get an
accessibility report. The <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/extension"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WAVE Chrome Extension</a> is a
good example of a browser-based plugin.</p>
<div class="colorBox toolkit">
<strong>Toolkit:</strong> Add an automated web accessibility checker
such as <a href="https://achecker.ca/documentation/web_service_api.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a> or <a
href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WAVE accessibility checker</a> to your
toolkit. They can be used to get a sense of the accessibility of your
organization’s website.
</div>
<h3>Other Accessibility Checkers</h3>
<p>The accessibility checkers mentioned above are just a tiny sample of
the tools available. A well-crafted Google search, using terms like
“accessibility checker” turns up many more. Or, you can browse through
the list of accessibility checkers compiled by the W3C at the following
link.</p>

</div>
<h2>Other Types of Automated Testing Tools</h2>
<p>While using automated web-accessibility checkers is a good start for
assessing the accessibility of an organization’s web resources, there
are likely other tools needed to assess different types of content.
Examples of such tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"

Checkers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://readable.io/text" target="_blank"

target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PDF Accessibility
Checkers</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Manual Testing</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, automated testing cannot identify all potential
accessibility barriers. There are a few easy manual tests that can be
used to identify issues automated checkers may not pick up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tab Key Test</strong>: Determines whether all functional
elements in web content are keyboard accessible. Place a mouse cursor in
the location field of your web browser, then repeatedly press the Tab
key on your keyboard and follow the cursor’s path through the web page.
Any functional elements like links, buttons, tabs, or forms, among
others, should all receive focus while tabbing through the page and,
while in focus, should operate by pressing the Enter key or
spacebar.</li>
<li><strong>Select-All Test</strong>: Determines keyboard accessibility
also. While your mouse cursor is focused on a web page, press CTRL+A
(CMD+A on Macs) to select all the content on the page. Any items that
are not selected are potentially not keyboard accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Screen Reader Testing</strong>: A little more involved than
the two tests above. Install a screen reader and navigate through a web
page using the Tab key or arrow keys (in most cases). While listening to
the output of the screen reader, determine if the output make sense; if
not, there could be accessibility and usability problems. We recommend
that web developers have a screen reader installed to test web content
before it goes public. The <a href="http://www.chromevox.com"
target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ChromeVox screen
reader</a> works well for this purpose, installing as an extension for
the Chrome web browser.</li>
<li><strong>User Testing</strong>: Though not always required, having
actual users with disabilities navigate your company’s web content can
turn up a variety of usability issues that an accessibility expert may
not identify. When recruiting people with disabilities for testing,
ensure they are comfortable navigating the Web and are able to use their
assistive technologies effectively to get meaningful feedback on
usability issues. Novice assistive-technology users may encounter
problems related to their inexperience, rather than problems with the
accessibility of the content.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76"
height="76" />Understanding now that there are gaps in the company’s
compliance with accessibility guidelines, you start to think about the
approaches you might take to implement solutions to fill those gaps.</p>
<p>Having spent some time learning about accessibility testing and
trying the tools and strategies you came across, you discover there are
lots of potential accessibility problems with the company’s website. You
share the results of your testing, and the tools and strategies with
your senior web developer, who you ask to review and come up with an
estimate of the time it would take to fix the issues you discovered.</p>
<p>The web developer reports back to you after a few days with a plan
that will take longer than you expected. But, he also suggests, having
reviewed the details of WCAG and the local accessibility regulations,
perhaps he could prioritize the issues by first addressing the critical
Level A issues described in WCAG, as well as addressing some of the
easier Level AA issues.</p>
<p>He also suggests that you go back to the shopping cart vendor and see
whether they are open to making some changes to their system to improve
accessibility, reviewing the relevant business arguments if necessary in
order to convince them the work will be good for their business.</p>
</div>
<h2>Retrofitting versus Starting Over</h2>
<p>Retrofitting an inaccessible website can be time consuming and
expensive, particularly when the changes need to be made by someone
other than the website’s original developer. Adding accessibility to a
new development project will require much less effort and expense,
assuming the developers have accessibility forefront in their mind while
development is taking place.</p>
<p>Sometimes retrofitting is the only solution available. For instance,
a company is not prepared to replace its website with a new one. In such
cases, it may be necessary to prioritize what gets fixed first and what
can be resolved later. WCAG can help with this prioritizing. It
categorizes accessibility guidelines by their relative impact on users
with disabilities, ranging from Level A (serious problems) to Level AAA
(relatively minor usability problems). These levels are described
below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level A</strong>: These issues <strong>must</strong> be
resolved, or they will produce barriers that prevent some groups of
people from accessing content.</li>
<li><strong>Level AA</strong>: These issues <strong>should</strong> be
resolved, or they will create barriers that are difficult to get around
for some groups of users.</li>
<li><strong>Level AAA</strong>: These issues <strong>could</strong> be
resolved to improve usability for a wide range of people, including
those without disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Level AA is the generally agreed-upon level most organizations should
aim to meet, while addressing any Level AAA requirements that can be
resolved with minimal effort. For organizations that directly serve
people with disabilities, they may want to address more Level AAA
issues, though it should be noted that full compliance with Level AAA
requirements is generally unattainable, and in some cases undesirable.
For instance, the WCAG lower-level high school reading level requirement
is a Level AAA requirement. For a site that caters to lawyers, or
perhaps engineers, high school-level language may be inappropriate, or
even impossible, thus it would be undesirable to meet this guideline in
such a case.</p>
<div class="colorBox keyPoint">
<strong>Key Point:</strong> Level AA is the generally agreed upon level
of accessibility most organizations should strive to meet. Where
feasible, some Level AAA issues could also be addressed.
</div>
<h2>Working with Vendors and Developers</h2>
<p>It is not uncommon for vendors, particularly those from jurisdictions
that have minimal or no accessibility requirements, to resist an
organization’s requests to improve accessibility of their products. But,
there are also vendors who will jump at an opportunity to take advantage
of an organization’s accessibility expertise to improve their product.
The latter mentality is becoming more and more common as accessibility
awareness grows around the world.</p>
<div class="colorBox caseStudy">
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />You
realize that replacing the shopping cart on the company’s website, which
was the subject of the complaint the company received, is not currently
an option. The company has just renewed a three-year contract with the
shopping cart provider and breaking that contract would be very costly.
You understand that local regulations allow “undue hardship” as a
legitimate argument for not implementing accessibility, and the
company’s lawyer agrees.</p>
<p>Regardless, you also understand that your company is losing a
potentially large number of customers, who leave the website and shop
elsewhere when they encounter accessibility barriers. You want to
demonstrate that the company takes accessibility complaints seriously,
so you approach the shopping cart vendor with a proposal to help them
improve the accessibility of their product.</p>
</div>
<p>Depending on the vendor, various approaches may be taken to either
guide the vendor through the process of addressing accessibility in
their products, or convince a vendor that this is something they need to
do.</p>
<p>Ideally, you want the collaboration with a vendor to be a collegial
one, where both your company and the vendor are benefiting. You could
offer to have an accessibility audit performed on the software being (or
having been) purchased, which should have been done anyway as part of
the procurement process, and offer that audit to the company.
Contributing to a vendor in this way may create a sense of “owing your
company” and they will be more receptive to working together to address
accessibility issues. When purchasing a new product, it is often
possible to have the vendor cover the cost of an accessibility audit
performed by an auditor of the company’s choice. After the fact though,
it’s unlikely a vendor will want to take on that expense. Thus, an audit
may be more of an offering to keep the vendor on the side of the company
when asking for work from them that will likely be unpaid.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a vendor is resistant, and not interested in
your offer, as a last resort you may need to apply more cunning tactics,
for instance, by threatening to publish the accessibility audit.</p>
<p>Of course, these scenarios describe only a couple potential
vendor/client relationships, which really require a clear understanding
of a vendor’s position before approaching them with work they will
likely not be paid for. Often the business arguments, introduced
earlier, work well to convince vendors that accessibility is something
that they can benefit from.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that some vendors will be more approachable than
others and different strategies may be needed to have your accessibility
requirements met by what may be considerable effort on the part of the
vendor.</p>

class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />The
initial goals reached by the accessibility committee through its first
few meetings are to create an “accessibility culture” where the whole
company is aware of the importance of accessibility, creating a policy
that guides how digital accessibility is addressed throughout the
company.</p>
<p>With a number of gaps identified, the committee suggests several
initial areas to focus on, which together will provide the basis for the
company’s accessibility policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Build awareness</li>
<li>Provide training</li>
<li>Communicate accessibility guidelines</li>
<li>Monitor adherence to guidelines (quality assurance)</li>
<li>Ensure accessible procurement practices</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Building Awareness</h2>
<p>One of the main reasons barriers arise is a lack of awareness. Most
people have never met a person who is blind, let alone get to know such
a person. As a result, they have little reason to think about
accessibility and the potential barriers that may prevent a blind person
from accessing digital content.</p>
<h3>Hiring People with Disabilities</h3>
<p>One sure way to raise awareness of accessibility is to hire people
with a disability. Having people with disabilities in a company’s
workforce helps build diversity, spread tolerance, and raise awareness
of inequalities that are created when people have little or no
experience with disability.</p>
<p>Hiring a person who is blind, for instance, will help expose your
workforce to the challenges a blind person faces in everyday life and at
work. This person could be a member of the accessibility committee,
providing valuable input based on firsthand experience. This person
could also provide screen reader testing of the company’s digital
resources and quickly identify accessibility issues before they become
complaints.</p>
<p>People who are blind can be just as skilled at many activities as
people who can see. There are blind programmers, accountants, teachers,
lawyers, even hairstylists, to name just a few occupations. Many are
highly educated with advanced degrees and doctorates.</p>
<p>Blindness is used here as an example because this group tends to face
the most barriers in digital content. However, many people with
disabilities are skilled workers. They are often overlooked as a result
of systemic misconception of what people with disabilities are capable
of.</p>
<h3>Run an Accessibility Awareness Campaign</h3>
<p>Accessibility awareness campaigns can take a variety of forms and can
involve publicity, training opportunities, presentations, an archive of
resource materials, and an initiative for more company staff. Depending
on the size and type of business, some of the following strategies could
be used to implement an awareness campaign:</p>
<h4>Posters</h4>
<p>Posters can be placed in prominent places where staff are likely to
encounter them. Some of these locations may include elevators, printer
and copier rooms, lunch rooms, reception areas, and bathrooms. Posters
could also be made available through an archive linked from the
company’s website, where accessibility resources are gathered.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of the types of posters that might be used in an
accessibility awareness campaign: <a
href="http://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/dabp/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2018/04/pdf_accessibility.pdf"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accessible PDFs [PDF]</a></p>
<h4>How-To Instructions</h4>
<p>Instructional materials can also be created or gathered and added to
the accessibility resources. Here are a few examples of the types of
instructional materials that could be distributed:</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>

</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4>Instructional Videos</h4>
<p><a
href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc3K7oQf5TMAiC3K34w-log/videos"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Instructional videos</a> can
also be created, or gathered, and made available to staff. There are a
great many videos from sources like YouTube that can be gathered into a
single, easily accessible location, then publicized throughout the
organization. Here are some examples of accessibility-related
instructional videos. Search YouTube for more.</p>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4>Email Campaigns</h4>
<p>Email campaigns can also be another effective way to raise awareness,
perhaps as part of a company newsletter include an “Accessibility
Awareness” section. This section might include a link to video
tutorials, perhaps updated from accessibility efforts ongoing throughout
the company, links to various resources, or announcements about upcoming
accessibility workshops. The possibilities are many, and, because a
newsletter is distributed regularly, staff are consistently reminded of
their accessibility responsibilities.</p>
<p>Or, you could set up a company mailing list, that anyone with an
accessibility question can post to, as well as posting
accessibility-related information similar to a newsletter. A person or
two from the company’s accessibility committee could be assigned to
monitor the mailing list and provide responses when others have not
replied. All employees can be added to the mailing list, so everyone
becomes aware of ongoing accessibility efforts, and receive regular
“reminders” through the dialog occurring there.</p>
<h4>Workshops Presentations</h4>
<p>Educating staff and teaching them new accessibility-related skills
can help raise awareness throughout an organization. You may make
workshops mandatory for particular staff, like web developers, or
optional with a little bribery, like a pizza lunch, to get staff in the
same room for a presentation and a question-and-answer session.</p>

<h4>Accessibility Knowledge Base</h4>
<p>Providing an on-demand collection of resources related to
accessibility and encouraging employees to use them can also help raise
awareness. A knowledge base can be created with various types of
educational materials, such as printable how-to tutorials, video, and
examples of good practices. Employees should be encouraged to use these
resources and contribute their own accessibility solutions. New
additions to the knowledge base, or simply reminders to use what’s
there, can be encouraged through the company newsletter, or perhaps with
a prominent link on the company’s employee portal.</p>

<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />Your
accessibility resources are beginning to accumulate. You’ve decided to
put up a few posters and add an accessibility awareness section to your
company’s monthly newsletter.</p>
<p>One of the things you’d like to do is develop a number of short
workshops for staff in specific roles. Since your company distributes
many PDF documents, you think this would be a good starting place for
developing the workshops. However, you are not an expert in creating
accessible PDF documents, so you will need to educate yourself first.
You check with the web accessibility auditing firm you communicated with
before doing your own informal audit of the company’s website, and it
turns out they offer an accessible documents workshop.</p>
<p>You also realize that the company’s web developers need to be trained
as well. While you could give your developers access to the resources
you gathered on developing accessible websites, having an expert coach
your developers will be a more effective way to get them trained
quickly, and it will also give them the opportunity to ask questions,
including ones specific to the company’s website and the development
processes in place at the company.</p>
<p>You plan to attend the workshops yourself, keeping an eye open for
participants with a particular talent or enthusiasm for the topics being
taught, thinking ahead to potential staff who could be recruited to the
accessibility committee or to lead future workshops or
presentations.</p>
</div>
<h2>Training Efforts Can also Help Develop Awareness</h2>
<p>There are a variety of topics related to accessibility that make good
one- to three-hour workshops, which teach specific skills and knowledge
or raise awareness of accessibility issues. During the early stages of
developing digital accessibility business practices in an organization,
it may be necessary to bring in an external service to provide training;
however, over time, particular staff within the organization may be able
to take on the role of instructor. The opportunity to teach topics
further helps the trainer build expertise in the topic.</p>
<p>Here are a few suggestions that could be developed into workshops or
lunchtime presentations:</p>
<h3>Accessible Document Authoring</h3>
<p>Audience: Office staff and others</p>
<p>Topics: Creating accessible Microsoft Word documents, converting Word
documents to PDF, and using Adobe Acrobat Pro to make PDFs
accessible</p>
<h3>How People with Disabilities Use the Web</h3>

<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />To
ensure consistency in the accessibility of the company’s digital
content, the accessibility committee has decided there needs to be a set
of simple guidelines staff can follow. You start by creating three
guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web Development Accessibility Guidelines</li>
<li>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</li>
<li>PDF Accessibility Guidelines</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>Web Development Accessibility Guidelines</h2>
<p>Though you could just have your developers review WCAG to understand
what needs to be done to ensure the company’s presence on the Web is
accessible to everyone, there would be a great deal of “interpretation”
required, and many aspects of WCAG that may not be relevant. Instead,
you may want to identify the specific issues that need to be addressed
in the company’s websites, and develop a set of guidelines specific to
those issues.</p>
<p>Use the <a
href="http://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/dabp/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2018/04/10-Key-Guidelines.pdf">10
Key Guidelines [PDF]</a><strong> </strong>as your starting point. These
guidelines can be distilled to create a brief list of issues developers
must keep in mind when developing for the Web. These guidelines might be
as follows, though depending on the organization, may require minor
adapting to fit its needs. They should be easy to learn and
memorize.</p>
<ol>
<li>All images must have an alt attribute that describes the meaningful
elements of the image, or the alt attribute is left empty if the image
is decorative or otherwise meaningless.</li>
<li>All multimedia content with meaningful dialogue must have captions
(video) or a transcript (audio).</li>
<li>Content with meaningful sections or topics must be structured using
properly sequenced HTML headings.</li>
<li>If a series of items looks like a list, use proper list markup to
format those items.</li>
<li>Where data is being presented in a table, the first row (and
sometimes the first column) should be formatted as proper table header
cells (i.e., &lt;th&gt;).</li>
<li>Ensure that when navigating through web content using the Tab key,
the cursor moves from left to right, top to bottom, and does not veer
from that pattern.</li>
<li>Ensure that the cursor’s focus is easily visible when navigating
through elements of the page with the Tab key.</li>
<li>When using colour to represent meaning, ensure that something other
than colour also represents that meaning.</li>
<li>Ensure that contrast between foreground (text) colours and
background colours provide sufficient contrast, at a ratio of 4.5:1
minimum for smaller text, 3:1 for larger text.</li>
<li>Ensure that all features that operate with a mouse, also operate
with a key press.</li>
<li>Provide ways to skip past repetitive content using bypass links and
ARIA landmarks.</li>
<li>Ensure that link text describes what would be found if the link were
followed.</li>
<li>Ensure that accessible error or success feedback is provided after
completing an action such as submitting a form or logging in, typically
using the ARIA alert role with the element containing the feedback.</li>
<li>Ensure that all form fields are explicitly labelled using the HTML
Label element.</li>
<li>Ensure that all functional elements whose operation is not
immediately obvious, includes instructions on how to use them.</li>
<li>Describe the accessibility features of an application or website,
and position a link to those details in the interface that will be easy
to find for assistive technology users.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h2>
<p>The Web content accessibility guidelines will be very similar to
those for web development listed above, though differing in that content
typically tends to be less interactive than a user interface. As such,
these guidelines focus more on the accessibility aspects of content.</p>
<ol>
<li>All images must have an alt attribute that describes the meaningful
elements of the image, or the alt attribute is left empty if the image
is decorative or otherwise meaningless.</li>
<li>If images cannot be effectively described in alt text of 125
characters or less, provide a full description in the surrounding text,
with a short description and a reference to the full description in the
alt text.</li>
<li>Avoid using images of text, and where unavoidable, reproduce the
meaningful text of the image as actual text in the image’s
surroundings.</li>
<li>All multimedia with meaningful dialogue must have captions (video)
or a transcript (audio).</li>
<li>Content with meaningful sections or topics must be structured using
properly sequenced HTML headings.</li>
<li>If a series of items looks like a list, use proper list markup to
format those items.</li>
<li>When using colour to represent meaning, ensure that something other
than colour also represents that meaning.</li>
<li>Ensure that contrast between foreground (text) colours and
background colours provide sufficient contrast, at a ratio of 4.5:1
minimum for smaller text, 3:1 for larger text.</li>
<li>Where data is being presented in a table, the first row (and
sometimes the first column) should be formatted as proper table header
cells (i.e., &lt;th&gt;).</li>
<li>Ensure that all form fields are explicitly labelled using the HTML
Label element.</li>
</ol>
<h2>PDF Accessibility Guidelines</h2>
<p>PDF accessibility guidelines are similar to web content accessibility
guidelines, though there are PDF specific requirements such as reading
order, reading language, and document tagging that also need to be
addressed to create an accessible PDF. Documents are typically created
with Microsoft Word, saved as a PDF, then opened in Adobe Acrobat Pro to
adjust the document’s accessibility.</p>
<ol>
<li>When creating a Word document to be converted to PDF, use proper
headings to organize sections/topics in the document.</li>
<li>When creating a Word document to be converted to PDF, ensure all
images have alt text describing the meaningful elements of the
image.</li>
<li>When creating a Word document to be converted to PDF, ensure that
any document with data tables have the “Repeat as header row at the top
of each page” option checked in the table properties.</li>
<li>Use the Windows version of Word 2010+ to save Word documents as PDF
with the “Document structure tags for accessibility” option checked when
saving. (This is not supported on Macs.)</li>
<li>Use the Make Accessible tools of the Action Wizard in Adobe Acrobat
Pro 11+ or Acrobat Pro DC to assess the accessibility of the converted
Word document, and make accessibility adjustments.</li>
<li>Use the Reading Order tool in the Acrobat Pro toolbar on the left to
arrange the elements in the PDF in a logical reading order.</li>

<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />The
company’s web developers are working hard to educate themselves about
web accessibility, and they are actively attending workshops and
investigating accessible web development practices. You see improved
accessibility in the company’s websites, though there is still
uncertainty about whether the sites comply with local accessibility
requirements.</p>
<p>You return to the accessibility auditing firm you are currently in
contact with while you have been developing the company’s accessibility
plan, and you ask for their assistance in auditing a number of new
features that have been added to the main website. Ultimately though,
you want to have an expert accessibility person on staff, who can
provide accessibility audits on demand.</p>
</div>
<h2>Web Content Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>In an ideal situation, an organization’s web developers would provide
web accessibility audits. However, even with accessibility experience,
it is wise to have a second pair of eyes review the work of the
implementer. This task can be assigned to another developer or perhaps
the Accessibility Champion. This is a typical practice in many
development activities, and should be no different when accessibility is
the subject. In the early stages of building accessibility knowledge
into a company’s culture, however, the expertise may not exist in-house
to provide effective quality assurance, so third parties may need to be
brought in.</p>
<div class="colorBox caseStudy">
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />Your
senior web developer does have some experience with web accessibility,
though he does not consider himself an expert. The other developers on
staff are still new to the subject. As a result, there is not a
sufficiently knowledgeable developer on staff to review the
accessibility work of the senior member of the team. You decide that
while your developers are building their accessibility expertise, you
will bring in a third-party auditor, both to review and to train your
developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="colorBox keyPoint">
<strong>Key Point:</strong> Third-party auditing services can be a good
source of expertise for managing accessibility quality assurance and
training staff.
</div>
<p>Accessibility reviews from an expert third-party auditor can act as a
form of training. Typically, web accessibility reports will identify
barriers, explain why particular barriers are a problem, and provide
potential solutions to correct problems. They are typically written for
a developer audience, so they are effective tools to educate developers.
There will often be questions and feedback between the developer and the
auditor, much like a student to teacher relationship. It may only take a
few audit scenarios to bring developers to a point where they can do
their own audits.</p>

<h2>Automated Tools to Monitor Web Accessibility</h2>
<p>Another option to help ensure the accessibility of an organization’s
web content is to implement an accessibility-monitoring system that will
send alerts when potential problems are detected. There are a number of
these systems available of varying cost and coverage, some of which
include other quality assurance tests, like spell checking, finding
broken links, testing text readability, and, even, PDF testing. Though
these tools can be helpful in catching issues, they should not be relied
upon exclusively to identify all potential accessibility issues that may
arise in an organization’s web content. Reviews by a human being should
also be conducted on a regular basis. Reports could be shared through a
knowledge base where all such reports and accessibility-related
information can be stored.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of accessibility monitoring applications that
might be used to supplement accessibility quality assurance efforts of
an organization.</p>

rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Vamola</a> (Italy) – now
inactive, but a good base to build your own.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Document Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>Document-accessibility auditing is relatively simple when compared
with web accessibility auditing. Typically, a third-party review of
documents is not necessary, though there may be cases where complex
documents, like forms, do require more than basic skills to make them
accessible.</p>
<p>For most documents, running the authoring software’s accessibility
review tool is sufficient to pick up any potential problems that may
exist in a document. Training to use these tools can often be completed
in a few hours, followed by opportunities to use these new skills to
develop expertise. It may be helpful to have other document authoring
staff quickly examine accessibility for the author, as a second review
to ensure the document is as accessible as it can be. Having staff
review others’ work for accessibility can help strengthen accessibility
awareness and maintain accessibility skills across a broader range of
staff.</p>
<p>If you have a copy editor or production editor on staff, who reviews
grammar, word usage, and spelling, and so on, this person may be a good
candidate to develop expertise in document accessibility testing, to
combine accessibility testing with copy editing.</p>

Considerations</h2>

<div class="colorBox caseStudy">
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />Most
of the digital accessibility concerns within your company revolve around
the Web, electronic documents, and multimedia. In your research, you
discover there are a few other areas where digital accessibility should
be considered. These include branding, coding practice, and
communication.</p>
</div>
<h2>Branding</h2>
<p>When considering branding elements for an organization, there are a
few accessibility considerations to keep in mind.</p>
<p><strong>Use of colour</strong>: Using the WCAG guidelines for colour
use, ensure sufficient contrast between text colours, and the background
colour they may appear over. At a minimum, use standard 10- to 12-point
fonts and provide a contrast ratio of 4.5:1 or greater.</p>
<div class="tryThis colorBox">
<strong>Try This:</strong><a
href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How to Test Colour
Contrast</a>.
</div>
<p><strong>Fonts:</strong> There are font characteristics that make
fonts more or less legible, thus, more or less readable. “Fancy” fonts
like <span
style="font-family: &#39;Comic Sans MS&#39;, &#39;Comic Sans&#39;, cursive">Comic
Sans</span> for instance, can take longer to recognize, and this affects
reading speed. This effect can be magnified for those with a print
impairment.</p>
<div class="colorBox sugReading">
<strong>Readings &amp; References:</strong> <a
href="https://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/level-4/fine-typography/legibility"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Article on Font Legibility</a>
</div>
<p><strong>Images with Text</strong>: While sometimes it is unavoidable,
images of text should be used sparingly or avoided altogether. Text in
images tends to degrade when magnified by those with low vision, making
it difficult to read. For those who are blind and using a screen reader,
text in images cannot be read at all. The text of a logo is an
exception, but, if you also include a company motto as part of the logo,
for instance, consider adding it as actual text next to the logo, rather
than making it part of the logo image itself.</p>
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>You might be surprised to know that there are quite a few blind or
low-vision computer programmers. The way they code is much like any
other coder does. Though code itself is not typically accessible or
inaccessible. Good coding practices, such as effective use of space and
effective commenting, can make code more usable for both sighted and
blind coders.</p>
<div class="colorBox sugReading">
<strong>Readings &amp; References:</strong> <a
href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-blind-people-code-fdb64e3bf5c"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">How blind coders code</a>
</div>
<h2>Communication</h2>
<p>Many of the guidelines for creating accessible web content and
documents also apply to communication. Where paper
<strong>documents</strong> are distributed, be sure an electronic
version is also available, making sure headings are properly used to
structure topics, and describe in text form any visual elements in the
communication.</p>
<p><strong>Email</strong> can also be a major form of communication,
both for promotional purposes and for personal communications. Emails
can be created as plain text, rich text, or HTML. While plain text will
generally be accessible, it can lack structural elements, which may be
important for longer emails. Rich text and HTML can be marked up with
headings, lists, alt text for images, and so on, to make them more
accessible. Although there may be readers who display emails as plain
text, in which case these formatted emails can be difficult to
understand. For a typical personal email communication, plain text is
usually fine. Where formatted text is used, it is advisable to also
provide a plain text version as a fallback.</p>
<p>For more about accessible email, see the following optional
readings.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Text chat</strong> is also becoming a more common form of
communication, often used by customers to contact support services
through a real-time chat application linked from a website. These
applications can often be inaccessible to blind users if they have not
been developed with consideration for accessibility. The primary
considerations when choosing a synchronous web-based chat application
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Properly implemented WAI-ARIA Live Region support</li>
<li>Ability to pause new messages</li>
<li>Access to a log of chat messages</li>
<li>Keyboard access throughout the application</li>
<li>An audio indicator when new messages are posted</li>
<li>A visual indicator when new messages are posted</li>
<li>Easy shortcut navigation between the message input field, the chat
stream, and the connected users list (if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on what makes a chat application accessible, as
well as ratings for many popular chat applications (as of 2013), see the
following Readings &amp; References. Though the focus in the article is
on chats used in education, it is relevant for other chat usage
scenarios.</p>

Learning Purposes? A Study of the Required Characteristics</a>
</div>
<h2>Service Equality versus Compliance</h2>
<p>Though all services should ideally be accessible to anyone who
attempts to access them, there may be occasions when it is just not
possible to provide full access for everyone. Chats are one example
where there may be unavoidable barriers, mainly because most of the
available chat applications have room for accessibility improvements.
That said, though, chat accessibility is improving.</p>
<p>Another good example of a technology that remains a challenge to
access for some people with disabilities is videoconferencing systems.
Though there have been efforts made by developers to improve the
accessibility of these technologies, the currently available systems are
generally difficult to use, are only partially usable, or are not usable
at all with assistive technologies.</p>
<p>In cases such as these, all efforts should be made to procure the
most accessible technology you can find, but with the understanding that
they may not be accessible to everyone given the state of the art for
these technologies. This is not to say organizations should not use
them, but instead where they are used, acknowledgement should be
provided about the limited access available, and provide an alternative
where possible.</p>
<p>Similarly, primary service-delivery methods should be made accessible
first, rather than resorting to providing alternative means of accessing
these services for those with disabilities. For instance, do not create
a website that is inaccessible because your organization wants to make
use of some compelling, inaccessible technology, then create an
alternative site for those accessing with assistive technology as a
means of complying with regulated accessibility requirements. Despite
best intentions, maintenance and upkeep of alternative sites are likely
to fall behind that of the primary site. In general, the practice of
providing alternative websites is frowned upon, except in cases where it
is unavoidable because the technology being used is not yet available in
an accessible form.</p>

class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />You
understand that there will be a significant change in the way the
company does business, implementing what you see as a change in the
culture of the company. Your employees already understand aspects of
accessible customer service with the company’s retail locations, such as
ramps connecting floor levels within stores, elevators where stairs are
used to move between levels, and checkout counters that accommodate
wheelchair users, among other adjustments to “physical spaces.” But,
there is little knowledge within the company around issues of “digital
accessibility.”</p>
<p>Accommodation for accessibility of physical spaces is less likely to
require change in the company’s processes, but digital accessibility
quite likely will. It will also involve changes in employee
behaviour.</p>
<p>To counter any resistance to the changes that will be needed, you
decide to educate yourself on change management. You gather all the
information you need for forming arguments that you can use to convince
your colleagues, leveraging the business arguments for implementing
digital accessibility: these changes are something the company “wants to
do” rather than “has to do,”  and these changes are good for the
company.</p>
</div>
<p>So far you have experienced the “business case” for digital
accessibility, and you have also been exposed to the legislative reasons
behind it. <a
href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Research suggests</a> that
companies who embrace a culture of accessibility are more
successful/profitable. However, acceptance of this culture isn’t
necessarily easy. One key issue you might experience in fostering a
culture of accessibility is ”resistance to change” from some of your
employees/colleagues. They may wonder why dedicating resources (people,
time, money) to implementing digital accessibility is important and how
it will affect them.</p>

<p>People resist change for a number of reasons, most notably, due to
fear of the unknown. Not knowing how the change will affect them
directly (and to a smaller extent how it affects the company) will cause
a number of employees to not readily or willingly accept (at least
initially) the proposed changes. Linked with this is the fear of
breaking routines, both in how people do their jobs and how it affects
their life in general (hours, travel, and technology, etc.).</p>
<p>Resistance to change can occur when workers and management do not
agree with the reasons for the change and the advantages and
disadvantages of the change process.</p>
<p>Some reasons for resisting change include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-interest, which can occur when people are more concerned with
the implication of the change for themselves rather than considering the
effects for the company’s success.</li>
<li>Misunderstanding, because the purpose of the change has not been
communicated effectively or has been interpreted differently.</li>
<li>Low tolerance to change, because workers prefer having security and
stability in their work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Experience (and research) suggests that the best strategies for
minimizing resistance to change is to communicate more effectively, to
help people develop the skills/knowledge to handle the proposed changes,
and to involve them in designing the changes to be implemented.</p>
<p>In this section of the unit, you will gain an understanding of some
of the reasons why people may resist change which you may encounter in
your organization and how to overcome them.</p>
<p>Change is difficult. The more prepared you are to deal with
resistance, the better your chances for success in implementing the
changes required. Watch this video outlining seven key strategies for
overcoming resistance:</p>

<p>Instilling digital accessibility culture throughout an organization
is likely going to involve change, change that may meet with some
resistance. Change can be uncomfortable, and for processes and practices
that are ingrained in an organization over many years, it can be very
difficult to upset this “status quo.”</p>
<p>Depending on the scope of changes that must occur, preparing for
change may be critical to successfully implementing a digital
accessibility plan. It is helpful to have a framework from which to
manage the changes that will occur as digital accessibility is being
implemented throughout an organization.</p>
<p>But which model or framework should you use to help implement a
successful accessibility plan? Change management books will introduce
you to many models that may fit with your company culture and work
processes. To give you a couple of samples of proven change models, we
will use Kotter’s eight-step model in this section and Lewin’s
three-step change model in the next. Both have many loyal followers and
can help you think about how to start moving towards your new digital
accessibility plan. Whichever model works best for you, it is important
to remember that all of the steps must be followed in order for the
model to be effective.</p>
<h2>Kotter’s Eight-Step Model for Leading Change</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kotter" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. John P. Kotter</a> at the Harvard Business
School, devised the “Eight-Step Process for Leading Change.” It consists
of eight stages:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create Urgency</li>
<li>Form a Powerful Coalition</li>
<li>Create a Vision for Change</li>
<li>Communicate the Vision</li>
<li>Remove Obstacles</li>
<li>Create Short-Term Wins</li>
<li>Build on the Change</li>
<li>Anchor the Changes in Corporate Culture</li>

<div class="colorBox caseStudy">
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />Using
Kotter’s process, you imagine the pieces of your growing plan fitting
into his framework as a way to optimize the strategies and ensure that
your hard work pays off for the company.</p>
<p><strong>1. Create Urgency</strong></p>
<p>The obvious element of urgency in your company’s case is the
complaint and the suggestion by the customer that legal action may be
taken if the company does not show active movement toward resolving the
accessibility issues with the online store.</p>
<p>In addition, you may also argue that the market of people with
disabilities is a large one, and the company is currently missing out on
a good portion of this market, even sending potential customers to the
competition. There is an opportunity to capture a growing market of
older people with disabilities, many of whom are baby boomers who have
reached a stage in their lives where they are losing their sight or
hearing, and may not be as mobile as they used to be.</p>
<p>Most of all you need buy-in from senior people in the company. The
business arguments discussed in <a
href="#chapter-006-understanding-the-big-picture.xhtml">Unit 2</a>,
carefully crafted to highlight the benefits to the company, can go a
long way to convincing those who will ultimately determine whether a
shift in the business culture has a chance of success or not. In the
case of the Sharp Clothing Company, the threat of a lawsuit is a strong
motivator for senior management, though ideally other business arguments
should help lead to change before it reaches the point of legal
action.</p>
<p><strong>2. Form a Powerful Coalition</strong></p>
<p>The accessibility committee you have established fills this step of
the process, gathering leaders and knowledgeable staff, including those
who may need accessibility accommodations, from across the company. This
group of people will help define acceptable practices for the company by
its’ actions.</p>
<p><strong>3. Create a Vision for Change<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Understanding that many people will resist change, they want/need to
understand where the company is heading. Articulating a clear vision for
the company as to how the company wants to be seen and recognized with
respect to accessibility is key here. The accessibility committee’s
plan — including steps to build awareness, develop training, communicate
guidelines, monitor accessibility quality assurance, adjust procurement
processes, review hiring practice, and consolidate these in a digital
accessibility policy for the company — meets the objectives of this
step.</p>
<p><strong>4. Communicate the Vision</strong></p>
<p>Through the newsletter campaign, strategically placed posters,
training opportunities, a series of guidelines tailored to particular
roles, and the involvement of people from across the company, you will
communicate the company’s move towards creating an inclusive business.
This does require a highly coordinated and planned communication
strategy that must be consistently applied by the change team.</p>
<p><strong>5. Remove Obstacles</strong></p>
<p>You decide to make the accessibility committee meetings open, so
anyone who wants to attend may do so. You also decide to setup a virtual
“suggestion box,” positioned prominently on the company’s employee web
portal. There employees are encouraged to suggest improvements or
identify where accessibility issues occur. Since most employees like to
have a say in how things get done, take time to give them the
opportunity to try ideas that are in alignment with the vision and
strategies.</p>
<p><strong>6. Create Short-Term Wins</strong></p>
<p>The accessibility committee has come up with the idea of highlighting
accessibility accomplishments in the quarterly newsletter and on the
company’s main websites. Once per year, all the accessibility related
projects or suggestions would be gathered for the whole company to vote
upon, with the winner receiving a weekend for two at a local hotel and
spa. The reason short term wins are important is that they not only make
the participants feel good about accomplishing something, but it also
then gives them the momentum to move onto the next step or phase. By
having one large undefined project, employees may give up if they can’t
see the finish line ahead of them.</p>
<p><strong>7. Build on the Change</strong></p>
<p>Through the wins that have been gathered, the submitters or
implementers of more significant ones are given an opportunity to show
off their accomplishments. Presentations are recorded and posted to the
employee portal for all to see. Links to the videos are included in the
quarterly newsletter. Acknowledging the accomplishments and those
responsible for them acts as an important feedback mechanism and form of
appreciation from the change team.</p>
<p><strong>8. Anchor the Changes in Corporate Culture</strong></p>
<p>With much of the accessibility plan in place, your plan is to
formalize all of these elements into a company Digital Accessibility
Policy. Culture defines what is acceptable behaviour or not, and the
goal here is to make sure that your policy becomes part of your company
culture and what your company values.</p>

<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>Kurt Lewin developed a change model involving three
steps: <em>unfreezing</em>, <em>changing</em>, and <em>refreezing</em>.
The model represents a very simple and practical model for understanding
the change process. For Lewin, the process of change entails creating
the perception that a change is needed, then moving toward the new,
desired level of behaviour and, finally, solidifying that new behaviour
as the norm. The model is still widely used and serves as the basis for
many modern change models.</p>

<h2>Unfreezing</h2>
<p>In the initial phase of investigating digital accessibility, you have
been building awareness through the creation of the accessibility
committee, and you have been investigating what aspect of the company’s
processes and human resources need to be adjusted. Hanging posters in
the lunch room, elevators, and bathrooms, and the accessibility section
in the monthly newsletter is raising awareness across the company, ahead
of the retraining that is being planned.</p>
<p>You have also been practicing strategies for convincing staff at
various levels that accessibility is a good thing for everyone,
particularly those in senior positions, so that they understand the
business, social, and economic aspects of accessibility. You have
prepared yourself for resistance to the changes coming as part of the
company’s move toward becoming an inclusive organization.</p>
<h2>Changing</h2>
<p>Based on your knowledge of the Sharp Clothing Company’s workforce,
you have a series of short workshops planned that will help staff in
various positions learn about their responsibilities to produce
accessible products and deliver accessible customer service and
introduce them to the tools to help them accomplish these.</p>
<p>To help standardize the processes, the accessibility committee has
developed the guidelines for web developers, web content developers, and
document authors and producers, so it is clear what steps must be taken
in order to ensure they are producing products and services that will be
accessible to everyone. The training being planned uses these guidelines
as a framework for instruction, with staff receiving hands-on experience
with the tools and processes associated with their jobs , and they have
a reference they can continue to use and refer to until they have
mastered the tasks and strategies they were taught.</p>
<h2>Refreezing</h2>
<p>To ensure that attention to accessibility remains high, the company
newsletter will continue to highlight particular accessibility
accomplishments by staff, and present various accessibility tips and
interesting bits of knowledge to keep awareness high.</p>
<p>The yearly contest for the best accessibility implementation will
also help keep awareness high, publicizing ongoing efforts, and giving
people throughout the company the opportunity to vote on who should
receive the “Spa Weekend for Two.”</p>
<p>The plan is to hire on a screen reader user to help with
accessibility testing, to be a member of the accessibility committee, to
work day-to-day with the staff at head office, and to help keep
awareness high.</p>
<p>Having an employee who is blind will also help other staff members
become accustomed to people with disabilities, and become more aware of
barriers that may prevent some people from participating fully.</p>

<p><strong>Try This:</strong> Knowing that most people will resist
change for a variety of reasons, let’s watch a brief clip from a popular
TV show <em>Big Bang Theory</em> which demonstrates how some people
react to change.</p>

<p>Questions to think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you ever encountered a situation similar to this? If so, how
did you handle it?</li>
<li>Do you often find yourself as the waiter, trying to offer
suggestions to move things along? Were your ideas well received or
implemented?</li>
<li>What if you had to manage someone like Sheldon?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Identifying Forces For and Against Change</h2>
<p>Reflecting back to the “Dumpling Paradox” video clip, here are some
of their reasons for wanting to order dinner:</p>
<ul>
<li>They were hungry.</li>
<li>They were familiar with this restaurant.</li>
<li>They had past experience knowing what to order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, there were equally compelling arguments presented for not
ordering their regular items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Needing to now order for three persons rather than four.</li>
<li>Their regular menu choices would now lead to too much food to split
three ways.</li>
<li>Too much food overall for them to enjoy.</li>
</ul>
<p>What we have just done is to conduct a <strong>Force
Field</strong> analysis, a key process of the Kurt Lewin Change Model.
It helps you identify the compelling reasons for change and those
“forces” which will oppose change. This is a common first step many
change leaders use to assess a situation before introducing something
new. You can learn more about the process from <a

<p>Change can be uncomfortable, and, in hopes of avoiding this
discomfort, people will often present arguments against it. In this
activity, you will consider what arguments your colleagues at Sharp
Clothing might make in an attempt to stop or hinder your efforts to
introduce accessibility compliance.</p>
<p>Write three possible arguments a resistant employee may give in
opposition to implementing digital accessibility, and write a convincing
counterargument for each that would help reduce resistance. In each,
<strong>indicate who the target employee is and/or their role within the
organization</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Hints:</strong> You might search the Web for statistics or
other evidence that demonstrates the benefits of an accessible
organization.</p>
<p>Here are some example arguments against change. You may use these or
come up with others.</p>
<ul>
<li>This has been the way we have always done it.</li>
<li>We have no people with disabilities as clients.</li>
<li>It would cost too much to make our website accessible.</li>
<li>A blind person would not be able to access our website.</li>
<li>We don’t have the time or resources to implement your accessibility
plan.</li>
<li>We can just use the auto-captioning on YouTube for our promo
videos.</li>
<li>The laws do not apply to us; we only have 25 employees.</li>

this unit, you learned that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility auditing is an important step. Choosing a reputable
service involves careful consideration focusing on key reputability
factors.</li>
<li>Two approaches to accessible websites are retrofitting and starting
over. The correct approach for your situation will need to consider
several factors including outsourcing the work to external vendors.</li>
<li>Building a company-wide strategy about accessibility includes
building awareness, hiring people with disabilities, focused
presentations, and training.</li>
<li>Web development accessibility guidelines focus on user interaction
with a website, whereas <em>web content accessibility</em> guidelines
focus more on standards compliance. Both are important.</li>
<li>Several approaches should be used to monitor adherence to
accessibility guidelines including unbiased quality assurance reviews
and the use of automated tools.</li>
<li>Implementing accessibility will include managing change. Kotter’s
Eight-Step Model for Leading Change and Lewin’s Three-Step Model are two
common models that can help plan and facilitate the implementation.</li>
<li>Resistance by staff may be the most challenging element in
implementing change. Overcoming the five main reasons people resist
change needs to be part of your change management strategy.</li>

pieces of the Digital Accessibility Policy are coming together. You
understand that procurement also needs to be included as part of the
policy. Before proceeding, you decide to take a look at what others have
done in creating procedures for developing such a policy. You also want
to look at policies others have published. You discover a wide range of
policies, from simple statements outlining an organization’s commitment
to web accessibility, to complex documents that describe in great detail
each aspect of an organization’s digital accessibility requirements.</p>
<p>Some policies focus specifically on the Web, ensuring web content is
accessible to everyone. Others are more general, covering a wide range
of accessibility matters including customer service standards as well as
accessibility of the built environment.</p>
<p>You decide that your focus will remain on developing a policy that
encompasses digital accessibility, which includes web content,
documents, multimedia, and information technology (IT).</p>
</div>
<h2>Creating a Web Accessibility Policy</h2>
<p>WebAIM, at the Center for Persons with Disabilities at Utah State
University, undertook a project to develop an <a
href="http://webaim.org/articles/implementation"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Eight-Step Implementation
Model</a> for creating an organization’s web accessibility policy,
recognizing that implementing and maintaining a policy is a cultural or
systemic issue within that organization. It needs to be ingrained at all
levels to be successful and continue as business practice, with all
employees committed to an inclusive presence on the Web.</p>
<p>WebAIM describes the steps as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gather Baseline Information:</strong> This step is
essentially an audit of the organization’s website(s) current
accessibility status.</li>
<li><strong>Gain Top-Level Support:</strong> In order for an
accessibility policy to work, it needs buy-in from the top levels of the
organization.</li>
<li><strong>Organize a Web Accessibility Committee:</strong> Assemble
stakeholders from various groups in the organization, including
respected individuals from these groups, web development staff, and
where possible, people with disabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Define a Standard:</strong> Create an organizational web
accessibility standard, which could be based on WCAG 2.0 with
adjustments to match organizational needs.</li>
<li><strong>Create an Implementation Plan:</strong> Set timelines and
priorities, delegate responsibilities, and monitor progress.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Training and Technical Support:</strong> Identify
those who publish to the Web, assess their skills, plan training for
different groups, create lists of resources, tools, code samples, and
manuals that provide guidance on producing accessible web content.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor Conformance:</strong> Schedule annual/semi-annual
website reviews, define “monitoring” in someone’s job description, and
ensure that person is well versed in HTML authoring and web
accessibility.</li>
<li><strong>Remain Flexible:</strong> Plan for change, such as changes
in staff, standards, and technologies.</li>
</ol>

<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>While the focus of this unit is on procuring accessible information
technology (IT), accessible procurement in general should be part of a
larger policy that addresses accessibility at the organizational level.
A digital accessibility policy can also fall within a larger
accessibility policy which addresses other aspects such as access to
physical spaces and access to customer service.</p>
<p>Digital accessibility as a policy on its own will be introduced here
to set the context for our discussion of procurement in this unit and
the discussion of hiring practices in the next unit.</p>

</div>
<h2>Procurement in Accessibility Policy</h2>
<p>Procuring accessible IT will affect numerous elements of an
accessibility policy.</p>
<p>In the early stages of developing an accessibility policy, assessing
the baseline accessibility level will include taking stock of
third-party software used by the organization. These might include a
content management system (CMS), a learning management system (LMS),
point-of-sale systems, human resource management systems, and a variety
of other types of systems for administering day-to-day operations. Each
of these at some point would have gone through a procurement
process.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how procurement fits into an organization’s
overall digital accessibility policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to implement accessible procurement requirements, agreement
is needed from the organization’s top level.</li>
<li>When providing training and support, staff need to be taught how to
use accessibility features within the systems procured.</li>
<li>Ongoing monitoring is needed to ensure that upgrades to systems
don’t compromise accessibility. Often, when software as a service (<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">SaaS</a>) is being used,
system updates behind the scenes go unnoticed by typical users of the
system.</li>

<p>Many organizations will have in-house developers who create and
maintain web content and who can be trained to implement web
accessibility in their development practices. Most organizations
however, will <strong>purchase or license third-party software</strong>
or Web applications for particular purposes rather than having their
in-house developers create them. It is generally more economical to
license than it is to create complex systems like a content management
system (CMS) or a customer relationship management system (CRMS).</p>
<p>The accessibility of these third party tools should always be
assessed before committing to a particular system. This often starts by
<strong>asking vendors to describe the accessibility features</strong>
of their product in a request for proposals (RFP). This request might
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A checklist of desirable accessibility features that the vendor
completes</li>
<li>A request for a <strong>Voluntary Product Accessibility Template
(VPAT)</strong> if the company is in the U.S.</li>
<li>A request for a third party evaluation of the product being
procured</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some tips to follow once you receive accessibility
information from vendors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do some research and take the time to carefully assess the
vendor’s claims for accuracy:</strong> Because vendors are often in
competition to win your business, it is possible that they may
exaggerate claims, word claims to work around known issues in their
products, and, in the worst cases, make false claims about the
accessibility of their products. It can be helpful to look at the
vendor’s own website, test it with an automated checker, and look for
accessibility information there. This can tell you a lot about the
vendor’s accessibility knowledge. Failing to assess a vendor’s claims
may have significant legal consequences, if accessibility claims are
made against your organization and it can be shown that due diligence
was not employed when acquiring a product.</li>
<li><strong>Think beyond “yes or no”:</strong> It is not uncommon to
shortlist a product for purchase or licensing that is not fully
accessibility compliant, but that does have a good variety of
accessibility features. It can be counterproductive to make absolute
compliance a requirement. You may find for some complex systems that
there are no fully compliant offerings. A system may not be compliant,
but it may be the most accessible of a class of systems. Aim to procure
the system that provides the best mix of required features and
accessibility.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once your organization has decided on procuring a system, it is
important to <strong>build accessibility requirements into the
contract</strong>, so that if issues are later found that present
significant barriers, vendors must take responsibility and provide
solutions.</p>
<p>Some vendors will be receptive to accessibility requests,
particularly those in regions where accessibility laws affect their
ability to sell their products. It is not uncommon for vendors to have
little knowledge of accessibility, having never had such a request (but
who, when educated, may be very happy to accommodate those requests). To
set yourself up for success, simply plan to <strong>work with vendors
that understand the importance of accessibility</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-title">Creating an Accessibility Statement</h2>
</div>
<div class="ugc chapter-ugc">
<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<div class="colorBox caseStudy">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/sharp-logo-sm.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-168" width="76" height="76" />While
looking at accessibility policies developed by other organizations, you
come across several websites that include an “accessibility statement.”
You decide such a statement would be a good addition to your company
website. You spend some time reviewing statements others have posted to
their sites, then you gather a list of elements to include in the
statement you will create for your company.
</div>
<p>An accessibility statement can be used on a website and in various
documentation to let visitors and stakeholders know about the company’s
commitment to accessibility. Though an accessibility statement will help
inform others of an organization’s efforts and commitment, it is not a
requirement for compliance.</p>
<p>Outlined below are several elements you may consider including in an
accessibility statement. Once a statement has been prepared, it should
be linked prominently on a website, preferably near the top of the site,
where it will be easier to find for those who are navigating with
assistive technology.</p>
<h2>Statement of Commitment</h2>
<p>A standard statement of commitment for both the website and the
policy document can be created to guide an organization’s accessibility
efforts. The following is an example of what a statement of commitment
might look like:</p>
<div class="colorBox toolkit">
At XYZ Company, we are committed to ensuring our goods and services are
accessible to everyone and to removing barriers that may prevent some
people from accessing these goods and services.
</div>
<h2>Statement of Compliance</h2>
<p>If your website has been reviewed, either by an external auditor or
one internal, you might choose to include a statement that describes the
level of compliance the website meets. A statement of compliance must
include <strong>the date</strong> the site was judged to be compliant.
Because websites tend to change over time, compliance can only be
claimed for the date on which an audit was completed. A copy of an audit
report might also be linked from the statement, but is not required. A
second element that must be included in the compliance statement is
<strong>the specification</strong> or standard the site is claiming
compliance with. In most cases, this will be WCAG 2.0. The final
required element is the <strong>level of compliance</strong>, either
Level A, Level AA, or Level AAA (if WCAG is the specification being
used).</p>
<p>A simple statement of compliance might look like the following:</p>
<div class="colorBox toolkit">
On January 20, 2017, this website conformed with the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 at Level AA.
</div>
<p>A compliance statement may also include additional information about
the scope of the claim. For example, the claim may only refer to a
particular area of a website, in which case that portion should be
described in the claim, such as “the publicly accessible areas of the
site.” Or, a statement may only apply to parts of the website the
organization has control over, and not apply to third-party web
applications or services that may be used. A statement, then, might
include omissions, such as “not including the shopping cart
application.”</p>
<h2>Known Accessibility Issues</h2>
<p>It is not uncommon for an accessibility statement to acknowledge
potential barriers that an organization may be aware of, that are
perhaps a work in progress, or may refer to third-party tools or
technology that may not be available in an accessible form. Though this
statement should not be an excuse for using less-than-accessible tools
or applications on a website, it can help alleviate complaints when an
organization demonstrates their awareness and their plans to remedy
barriers over time, or to make public their use of technology that may
not have an available accessible alternative. One such example may be
videoconferencing systems. Though these are often required tools for
communication, there is no current videoconferencing system that would
comply with accessibility requirements.</p>
<p>An example of a known-issues statement might look like the
following:</p>
<div class="colorBox toolkit">
<p>We are aware of a number of potential barriers in the Shopping Cart
application that may prevent some users from purchasing products from
our website. We are working with the vendor to address these issues, and
we are looking at potential alternatives that may be implemented in the
future. If you are experiencing difficulties using the shopping cart to
make purchases, please contact our online support team at (111)
555-2134, who will be able to assist you with your purchase.</p>
</div>
<p>You may also include general contact information in the statement to
allow site visitors to report any accessibility problems they may
encounter.</p>
<h2>Website Accessibility Features</h2>
<p>Another element that might be included in an accessibility statement
is a description of the accessibility features that have been
implemented on a website. This can be helpful for users who need
accessibility features, so they do not need to discover these features
on their own, reducing the effort in learning how to use website
features when using assistive technology.</p>
<p>Some of these features may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keystrokes for direct keyboard access to features</li>
<li>Use of captions and/or transcripts with multimedia</li>
<li>Use or WAI-ARIA to create interactive elements</li>
<li>Use of navigation elements such as landmarks, bypass links, and
headings</li>
<li>Instructions for using complex features, like a photo gallery or
shopping cart application</li>
<li>Descriptions of a site layout</li>
</ul>

<div class="ugc chapter-ugc">
<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>There are a variety of circumstances where accessibility requirements
may need to be explicitly stated, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requests for proposals (RFP)</li>
<li>Purchase contracts</li>
<li>Purchasing procedures</li>
<li>Design specifications</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be other documents in an organization that also require
accessibility statements or requirements, such as process documents or
literature about the organization or its products. An organization’s
accessibility committee members may be asked to gather relevant
documents from their respective areas within the organization in order
to produce a full list of relevant document-accessibility statements.
Here, we will look at RFPs, and the request for accessibility
information they should contain.</p>
<div>
<h2>Request for Proposals (RFP)</h2>
<h3>General Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p>The <a
href="http://www.ncdae.org/resources/articles/procurement.php#samples"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Center on Disability
and Access to Education</a> (NCDAE) provides a number of examples for
wording that could be included in RFPs, for organizations in the U.S.
(see Sample 1 below). We have provided an AODA-adapted version (see
Sample 2 below). While statements such as these make relatively clear
what the requirements are to a person knowledgeable in
accessibility-related issues, they may not be explicit enough to produce
a good description of the product’s accessibility features. Such wording
also uses absolute language such as “Applicants must state their level
of compliance….” Given that many products may not fully comply, language
such as this can be used as a starting point, but it should be
supplemented with more specific requirements.</p>
<div class="colorBox">
<p><strong>Sample 1:</strong> Contained in a Request for Proposal
(Section 508)NOTICE – All electronic and information technology (EIT)
procured through this RFP must meet the applicable accessibility
standards of 36 CFR 1194. 36 CFR 1194 implements Section 508 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and is viewable at the following
URL: http://www.section508.gov The following Section 508 technical
standards are applicable to this RFP, as a minimum: “Software
Applications and Operating Systems (1194.21)”, “Web-based Intranet and
Internet Information and Applications (1194.22)”, “Video or Multimedia
Products (1194.24) C.4” Applicants must state their level of compliance
to applicable sections to be considered for purchase under this RFP.</p>
</div>
<div class="colorBox">
<p><strong>Sample 2:</strong> Contained in a Request for Proposal
(AODA)NOTICE – All information and communication technology (ICT)
procured through this RFP must meet the accessibility standards of the
Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulations (IASR) Reg. 191/11, s. 14
and O. Reg. 191/11, s. 15. Regulation 191/11, s. 14 implements the
Information and Communications Standards of the Accessibility for
Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA), with regard to accessible
websites and web content, and Regulation 191/11, s. 15 with regard to
Educational and training resources and materials, viewable at the
following URL: http://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/110191#BK15. The
associated technical standards for these regulations are specified in
the W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0, viewable at the
following URL: http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/. Applicants must state their
level of compliance to applicable sections to be considered for purchase
under this RFP.</p>
</div>
<h3>Specific Accessibility Requirements</h3>
<p>Consider developing a specific list of accessibility requirements for
vendors, using the WCAG 2.0 10 Key Guidelines introduced in Unit 2 as a
starting point, as well as any other requirements your organization may
deem necessary.</p>
<p>With this strategy in mind, we have created a sample checklist for
vendors. The checklist is structured so that vendors can easily indicate
their level of compliance with various requirements, and also provide
explanations for the indicated state of compliance. These explanations
are particularly important for items identified as “partially
compliant.”</p>

<strong>Toolkit:</strong> Download the <a
href="http://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/dabp/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2018/04/Sample-Vendor-Accessibility-Compliance-Checklist.pdf">Sample
Vendor Accessibility Compliance Checklist [PDF]</a> and add it to your
Toolkit. Depending on the type of product being procured, not all of the
10 Key Guidelines may be relevant. Adjust the list accordingly to
specify only those features relevant to the product type being procured.

Accessibility</h2>

<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>Assume that a vendor’s proposal is accepted for review and
competition and they are asked to provide a demonstration. It is at this
point when you can move into more particular, perhaps technical,
questions about specific accessibility features of their product.</p>
<h2>Assessing a Vendor’s Website</h2>
<p>It is often easy to get a sense of a vendor’s knowledge and
commitment to accessibility by simply looking through their website.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sample a few pages and run them through an <a
href="https://achecker.ca/checker/index.php">automated accessibility
checker</a> and <a href="https://validator.w3.org">HTML validator</a>.
How well do they do? The results will be a good indication of the
quality and accessibility of work the company does.</li>
<li>Does the vendor’s website have a prominent <strong>accessibility
statement</strong>? Though not a requirement, if they do have one, it’s
a good indication the company cares about accessibility.</li>
<li>Does that statement, if there is one, have a compliance claim and
<strong>are accessibility features on the site listed</strong>? If the
accessibility features are listed, it likely means they are thinking
about people with disabilities who are visiting their site, which is one
step above thinking about accessibility in general.</li>
<li>If there is a <strong>demo of the software</strong> you intend to
procure, sample a few screens for checker and validator testing. How
well do they do? You may be able to decide in this manner whether the
software you are intending to procure from this company has the
potential or not to meet the accessibility requirements of your
organization.</li>
<li>If an RFP is being issued, you may want to mention to vendors that
their website may be reviewed for accessibility. Or, you may want to
review websites prior to an RFP, to aid with shortlisting vendors to
approach.</li>

<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>During a product demonstration, specific and technical questions
should be asked. It is a good idea to have the responses from the RFP
accessibility requirements in hand so they can be clarified.</p>
<p>In addition to clarifications in the proposal’s accessibility
responses, here are some additional questions that can be asked to
assess a vendor’s level of accessibility understanding and their
willingness to address accessibility issues in their software to meet
your organization’s requirements.</p>
<div class="colorBox toolkit">
<strong>Toolkit:</strong> See <a
href="http://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/dabp/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2018/04/Accessibility-Questions-for-Product-Demonstrations-2-2.docx">Accessibility
Questions for Product Demonstrations</a> for a collection of questions
that can be asked while interviewing vendors.
</div>
<div>
<p>Here is the list of 10 possible questions and expected answers:</p>
<p><strong>1. Which accessibility standards does your product comply
with? At which Level (if WCAG)?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the jurisdiction of the vendor, a local accessibility
standard should be mentioned (e.g., Section 508 in the U.S.; AODA in
Ontario), or mention WCAG. Added points if the vendor is from a
different jurisdiction, and mentions the requirements of your
jurisdiction, if different from their own.</p>
<p>At a minimum, where WCAG is the vendor’s guideline of choice, Level A
should be mentioned, or talk about what remains to be addressed to meet
Level A. If Level AA is mentioned, added points could be given. If Level
AAA is mentioned, that is a warning sign, since very few if any complex
systems will meet Level AAA requirements. Ask what AAA features have
been implemented in the system.</p>
<p><strong>2. Is your product accessible without a mouse? Please
demonstrate.</strong></p>
<p>The answer should always be “Yes.” The vendor should be able to
demonstrate by using the Tab key to navigate through the user interface
(UI). All functional elements, like menus, links, buttons, and forms,
etc., should all be able to receive focus, and users should be able to
navigate through menus and open elements using only the keyboard. Watch
out for elements that can receive focus, but do not operate with a
keypress.</p>
<p><strong>3. Has your product been tested with assistive
technologies? If so, with which ones? </strong></p>
<p>Should answer “Yes.”</p>
<p>Should mention a screen reader at a minimum. Should be able to
identify which screen readers, such as ChromeVox, JAWS, NDVA, etc. Added
points if they also mention Voiceover and/or Talkback for mobile
devices.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>4. Who did the testing?</strong></p>
<div>
<p>The developers of the software should be mentioned. Screen reader
testing should be part of the development process. Or, a particular
accessibility person within the organization may be the tester. Added
points if people with disabilities were used in testing, or a third
party accessibility expert. Is the third party tester reputable, if one
was used?</p>
<p><strong>5. What was the testing methodology? What were the
results?</strong></p>
<p>Should mention a combination of automated and manual testing
strategies, and screen reader testing. Added points if testing with
people with disabilities is also part of their testing process.</p>
<p>Ideally mention the level of conformance reached, as well as
acknowledging any issues that may remain, and what they plan to do to
address those issues. Answering “fully accessible” is a warning sign.
Very few systems will be fully accessible to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>6. How is accessibility built into your company’s quality
assurance (QA) process?</strong></p>
<p>Should talk about the development process at a minimum, and where
accessibility design and testing tasks fit into the process. Added
points if the vendor goes into detail about the Web accessibility policy
implemented at the company.</p>
<p><strong>7. If you roll out upgrades after we purchase the product,
how can you assure us the upgrades will not break
accessibility?</strong></p>
<p>Should refer back to the QA process, local upgrade testing before
pushing updates to production environments. Added points if third-party
accessibility expert is involved.</p>
<p><strong>8. Does your product make use of WAI-ARIA? If it does, how
so?</strong></p>
<p>Where a product has a fairly complex, interactive UI, the answer
should be “Yes.” This indicates the vendor understands the complex
accessibility issues associated with custom-built web interactivity.</p>
<p>May mention using ARIA landmarks. Added points if the specific ARIA
attributes are mentioned for particular types of interactions, for
example, using menu-related ARIA for complex menu, tab panel–related
ARIA for tab panel presentations, and so on. Perhaps mention libraries
used to implement ARIA, like jQuery or MooTools, or perhaps a
custom-made ARIA library created by the vendor.</p>
<p><strong>9. Does your product adapt responsively to different screen
sizes? Please demonstrate.</strong></p>
<p>Should answer “Yes.” Should be able to grab the corner of a browser
window and drag it inward to reduce the window size, and the content
should adapt cleanly as the window size increases and decreases. Should
also be able to demonstrate the product on a mobile device like a
smartphone or tablet, and have the UI adapt to the device’s screen
size.</p>
<p><strong>10. Does your product magnify cleanly using just a browser’s
zoom feature? Please demonstrate.</strong></p>
<p>Should answer “Yes.” Should be able to use the browser’s z<span
style="font-size: 1em">oom function to increase the size of the content
to at least 200% without the content flowing off the side of the screen
or overlapping with adjacent content. Added points for zoom</span><span
style="text-align: initial;text-indent: 1em;font-size: 1em"> sizes
greater than 200%. Good zoom adaptation indicates relative measures (em,
%) have been used to size elements rather than absolute measures (px,
pt), which is also a requirement for good responsive designs.</span></p>

A Voluntary Product Accessibility Template, or VPAT as it is commonly
known, is a checklist that companies who supply the U.S. government can
fill out to document the accessibility of their products. Because a VPAT
is completed by the vendor, they have a tendency to present products in
a better light than what may actually be the case. As a result, any time
you are presented with a VPAT, it is important that a person
knowledgeable in web accessibility critically reviews the document.

<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>Even expertly created audits or assessments can benefit from a second
opinion. Not all auditors approach accessibility requirements the same
way. Some may have a more strict approach, following guidelines and
techniques more stringently. Others may have a more practical approach,
taking into consideration a range of variables such as budget, human
resources, and adaptive technology support for particular techniques,
etc. Those with a practical approach come up with solutions that best
fit the circumstance, perhaps foregoing some of the strict compliance
rules in favour of feasibility.</p>
<h2>Web Accessibility Auditing Services</h2>
<p>There are a growing number of companies that provide professional web
accessibility auditing services. Not all of these companies are
reputable and may not have an expert understanding of web accessibility.
Some of the same strategies one might use to evaluate the accessibility
knowledge of a vendor can also be used to evaluate the knowledge of a
potential auditor.</p>
<p>If you would like a third-party accessibility auditing service to
evaluate a product your organization is intending to procure, here are a
few things you should look for:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Are the auditors web developers?</strong> Many issues that
present barriers are the result of using HTML, WAI-ARIA, or JavaScript
incorrectly. A web developer (or a person with a strong understanding of
these technologies) can accurately identify the origins of more complex
issues and offer effective solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Does the service provide tools?</strong> The more reputable
services develop their own tools such as automated checkers, contrast
evaluators, and browser plugins, etc. that the average user can use to
test accessibility for themselves. A good collection of tools is a good
indicator that the service knows what it is doing. Tools may also
indicate that developers are on staff.</li>
<li><strong>How long has the service been in business?</strong> If you
can’t find any indication of how long the service has been in business,
be wary. If a service has been around for a while (over five years),
it’s a good indication.</li>
<li><strong>Is there a sample audit you can examine?</strong> You can
tell a lot about the skills of auditors by the reports they produce. Ask
for one if you can’t find one on the Web. If you are unable to get a
sample, be wary.</li>
<li><strong>Is the audit methodology posted publicly?</strong> Auditing
services that know what they are doing will post their methods for
everyone to see.</li>
<li><strong>Are there a variety of services to choose from?</strong> The
more reputable services will include a variety of audit options,
training for different audiences, website accessibility monitoring, and
other services that approach web accessibility from many angles.</li>
<li><strong>Is the service’s website accessible?</strong> Reputable
services will lead by example. Their websites will be spotless from an
accessibility perspective and the HTML of the site should validate.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Third-Party Web Accessibility Auditing</h2>
<p>It may be beneficial for both the vendor and the procuring
organization to have a third-party accessibility auditing service
brought in to provide an unbiased review of the software being acquired.
This requirement may be part of a contractual agreement that requires
confirmation of compliance with a given standard from an expert working
at arm’s length from the two parties. It provides a level of protection
for both parties, providing an objective account of a software’s state
of accessibility that both parties can refer to if disagreement should
arise.</p>

<h2 class="chapter-title">Contract for Accessibility</h2>
</div>
<div class="ugc chapter-ugc">
<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>Assuming you have received proposals from vendors, tested their
understanding of web accessibility, and are ready to move into a
contractual arrangement to license or purchase the software or web
application from one of them, it is important to lay out web
accessibility requirements in the issued contract.</p>
<p>The following are two approaches to defining accessibility
requirements: the first is a more <strong>general approach</strong>,
relying on a specific standard to which vendors can refer, and the
second is a more <strong>detailed approach</strong>, which relies on a
standard but also supplies specific requirements that must be met.</p>
<h2>Section 508 Wording</h2>
<div>
<p>The National Center on Disability and Access to Education (NCDAE)
provides some standard text for contracts that makes accessibility a
requirement of the agreement. This text will be relevant for those
procuring under the Section 508 regulations:</p>
<div class="colorBox">
<strong>Sample 1: Purchasing contracts of specific
products</strong><br />
Vendors must ensure that the course management system contained in the
proposal fully conforms with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, as amended in 2017. (For information on Section 508, see <a
href="https://www.section508.gov" rel="noopener noreferrer"
target="_blank">www.section508.gov</a>.) This includes both the student
and instructor views and also includes all interaction tools (e.g.,
chats, discussion forums), and add-ons (e.g., grade functions). Vendors
must declare if any portion of the version under consideration does not
fully conform to Section 508, and the ways in which the proposed product
is out of compliance.
</div>
<p><a
href="http://www.ncdae.org/resources/articles/procurement.php#samples"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span class="small">Source:
The National Center on Disability and Access to Education</span></a></p>
<p>While this approach may be sufficient in some cases, where it has
been confirmed that the vendor understands the requirements of Section
508, there will be cases when vendors don’t know if their product
conforms or not. To reduce that likelihood, details of the Section 508
requirements could be specified, something like the requirements
outlined in the “WCAG 2.0 Wording” section below.</p>
<h2>WCAG 2.0 Wording</h2>
<p>Like the wording for RFPs introduced earlier in this unit, it is
important for contracts to provide specific details in order to avoid
potential confusion for vendors who may not be fully aware of WCAG 2.0
requirements. The following is an adapted version of the Section 508
wording above, with suggested wording that specifies an agreed upon
course of action should accessibility issues be discovered after the
contract is implemented, along with the procuring organization’s
specific accessibility requirements. Though WCAG 2.0 is specified, this
language would be <strong>appropriate for those drafting AODA-related
web accessibility requirements.</strong></p>
<div class="colorBox">
<p><strong>Sample 2: Purchasing contracts of specific
products</strong>Vendors must ensure that the course management system
contained in the proposal fully conforms with the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0), Level AA, as published by the Web
Accessibility Initiative (WAI) of the W3C, summarized in the list below
(see <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag"
rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WCAG 2.0</a> for more
information). This includes both the student and instructor views and
also includes <u>all</u> interaction tools (e.g., chats, discussion
forums), and add-ons (e.g., grade functions). Vendors must declare if
any portion of the version under consideration does not fully conform to
WCAG 2.0 Level AA, and describe the ways in which the proposed product
is out of compliance.Vendors agree that their product will continue to
conform with these requirements, and in the event potential violations
are discovered, will arrange to have such issues resolved unless
otherwise agreed upon exceptions are stated in writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="colorBox">
<p>G1.1.1 (Level A)</p>
<p>All meaningful images in the User Interface (UI) include a text
alternative, in the form of alt text, that accurately describes the
meaning or function associated with the image.</p>
<p>G1.2.2 (Level A)</p>
<p>Where video is provided, either in the product itself, or in the
associated documentation, meaningful spoken dialog in the video includes
closed captions produced by a person rather than an automated
service.</p>
<p>G 1.3.1 (Level A)</p>
<p>Content is structured using proper HTML section headings (e.g., h1,
h2) and proper lists (i.e., ol, ul, li) rather than formatting that just
creates the appearance of a heading or list.</p>
<p>G 1.3.2 (Level A)</p>
<p>When navigating through elements of the UI and content using only the
Tab key, the cursor takes a logical path, from left to right and from
top to bottom.</p>
<p>G 1.4.1 (Level A)</p>
<p>When colour is used in a meaningful way, some method other than
colour is used to represent that same meaning.</p>
<p>G 1.4.3 (Level AA)</p>
<p>When text is presented over a coloured background, a minimum contrast
between the two of 4.5:1 for standard sized text, and 3:1 for larger
text, is provided.</p>
<p>G 2.1.1 (Level A)</p>
<p>All elements in the UI or content that function with a mouse click,
also function using only a keyboard.</p>
<p>G 2.4.1 (Level A)</p>
<p>Means are provided that allow assistive technology users, or keyboard
only users, to skip past repetitive elements such as menus and
navigation bars, using either bypass links, or WAI-ARIA landmarks.</p>
<p>G 2.4.4 (Level A)</p>
<p>All link text is meaningful either on its own, or within the context
of other adjacent links, accurately describing the destination or
function of the link.</p>
<p>G 3.3.1 (Level A)</p>
<p>Error messages are presented in a way that can be consumed by
assistive technology without requiring the user to search through the
content to find them, either presented consistently in one place on the
page or using an ARIA alert role.</p>
<p>G 3.3.2 (Level A)</p>
<p>Forms are formatted in a way that explicitly associates labels with
input fields, and sufficient instructions are provided to describe the
expected input in each field.</p>
<p>G 2.4.7 (Level AA)</p>
<p>When navigating through the UI using the tab key only, the focus
position is easily followed visually through elements on the screen.</p>
<p>G 4.1.1 (Level A)</p>
<p>(<strong>Exception</strong>: Meets this requirement to the extent
that markup violations do not introduce barriers that affect access for
assistive technologies.)</p>
<p>The markup of the UI complies with HTML5 specifications.</p>

<p>Now that you have a contractual agreement in place with a particular
vendor, you will want to maintain a working relationship with them
through which any accessibility issues that may be introduced into the
product, either through software updates or through issues discovered
after the contract is in place, can be resolved with minimal
aggravation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with the introduction of accessibility laws in many
jurisdictions, vendors and suppliers are becoming more aware of
accessibility issues and recognize that improving the accessibility of
their products is good for business. As such, vendors are often
receptive to accessibility improvements to their products. Your
organization can potentially provide free user testing through feedback
from your own employees or clients.</p>
<h2>Talking About Web Accessibility with Vendors</h2>
<p>How you approach your discussion of accessibility with vendors will
vary depending on the level of awareness the vendor already has. You
should already have an idea of the vendor’s understanding through the
assessments you have already done, reviewing the company’s website, and
if you are at the proposal stage, through responses to the requirements
laid out in the RFP.</p>
<p>You will generally want to start the accessibility discussion right
at the beginning of the procurement process. If there is work to be done
to improve accessibility, the best approach is to address it from the
start, rather than having to go back and retrofit after other details of
a potential contract have been worked through.</p>
<p>There are several <em>approaches</em> to the accessibility
<strong>discussion with vendors</strong>, which range from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Putting the onus on your company, the procuring organization, and
its responsibility to provide accessible products and service
(<strong>We can’t buy from you if you are not accessible</strong>)</li>
<li>Stating the business case, selling the idea that accessibility is
good for the vendor through increased sales and improved efficiency
(<strong>Your revenues will increase, and/or your costs will
decrease</strong>)</li>
<li>Stating the legal case, reducing the likelihood of legal action for
discriminating against people with disabilities (<strong>You are less
likely to be sued</strong>)</li>
<li>Making the social-conscience case or positioning the vendor as a
company that should demonstrate corporate responsibility. (<strong>It’s
the right thing to do</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The above may all sound familiar to you if you think back to
<strong>the business cases</strong> introduced early. There are a number
of other discussions you can employ to build a vendor’s accessibility
awareness:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessibility is practice, not a touch-up.</strong>
Addressing accessibility from the start requires little extra effort
once you know what you’re doing. Retrofitting can be difficult,
expensive, or even impossible.</li>
<li><strong>Standards are clear, and adopted all over the
world.</strong> Companies are adopting standards such as WCAG as a
business advantage. Many buyers have accessibility at the top of their
procurement requirements, and will often skip over suppliers that are
not addressing it.</li>
<li><strong>Show your accessibility.</strong> For those in the U.S., if
you do not have a VPAT, it will likely affect your bottom line.
Purchasers may bypass your company if they can’t find one. In other
areas of the world, providing an “accessibility statement” demonstrates
to purchaser’s that accessibility is a priority, and a well-thought-out
statement is more likely to cause purchasers to look at your company
more closely.</li>
<li><strong>We can help you become accessible.</strong> If your
organization knows what it needs in terms of accessibility, share that
knowledge with potential partner vendors and educate them as part of the
process of improving the accessibility of their products so they match
the needs of your organization.</li>

<p>This final unut will expand on the discussion of policy introduced in
<a
href="http://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/dabp/chapter/chapter-5-procurement-and-accessibility-policy">Unit
5</a>. One of the key elements in implementing web accessibility policy
is hiring staff that possess accessibility knowledge and ensuring they
know how accessibility fits into their roles.</p>
<p>Hiring staff explicitly to implement and manage accessibility efforts
is perhaps the most important indicator that an organization is
committed to developing and maintaining products and services that are
inclusive. There are two particular roles that we will examine here:
the <strong>Web Developer</strong> and the <strong>Web/IT Accessibility
Specialist</strong>. These two roles are generally responsible for the
bulk of compliance efforts undertaken in an organization.</p>
<p>Despite our focus on these two roles in particular, it is important
to remember that accessibility can and should be a part of a company’s
regular business practices, with staff at all levels contributing to the
maintenance of an organization’s accessibility status.</p>

clear to you that web developers need to have a good understanding of
accessibility, as they will be responsible for much of the company’s
digital accessibility. But, you also want to understand what knowledge
and skills other staff should have, so you can ask the appropriate
accessibility questions during job interviews with potential candidates.
</div>
<h2>Roles and Accessibility Responsibilities</h2>
<p>For most positions an organization may be hiring for, digital
accessibility knowledge or skills need not be a requirement, though
having that knowledge or skills should add points to a candidate’s
overall score. For most positions, a little training will provide the
needed details of accessibility requirements for particular roles.</p>
<p>Of the various roles that could be found in an organization, it is
the web developers who will need to be most familiar with accessibility
requirements and the strategies to meet those requirements. Knowledge
and skills for web developers will be covered separately later in this
unit.</p>
<p>The following lists in general terms the skills and knowledge each

reviewing the staff list when looking into training for various roles,
you discover the company employs only one person who has identified as
having a disability. Given approximately 15% of the population has a
disability, you think the company is missing an opportunity to benefit
from diversifying its workforce by leveraging this relatively untapped
talent pool. You also realize that hiring additional staff with a
visible disability will help spread awareness of the need for digital
accessibility throughout the company. You make the following
recommendation to the accessibility committee: The company should make
an effort to hire an accessibility quality-assurance person to test
products for accessibility, provide input on the company’s accessibility
practices, and help expose staff to people with disabilities to raise
awareness of the need for digital accessibility. You suggest hiring a
qualified person, who is blind and uses a screen reader to access the
web and other digital information, into a new office support role.</p>

<h2>Addressing Myths About Hiring People with Disabilities</h2>
<p>Although there are many well-educated, skilled people with
disabilities in Canada and in other countries around the world, they
continue to be unemployed, or underemployed at a rate more than twice
that of the general adult population. In fact according to Human
Resources and Skills Development Canada, more than 50% of people with
disabilities have high school diplomas, and over one third of these have
completed a post-secondary program.</p>
<p>In Ontario, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is
about 8% higher than the general population, as reported by the Ontario
Chamber of Commerce (OCC). According to the OCC, this is in part due to
systemic and cultural discrimination based on misperceptions of people
with disabilities. People with disabilities are often perceived as less
productive, more likely to take time off, too costly to accommodate, and
more likely to be a burden on employees who do not have disabilities. In
fact the opposite is true for all these points. Because people with
disabilities have more difficulty finding work, they are likely to value
employment more than typical fully abled workers.</p>
<p>The Ontario Chamber of Commerce has put together a list of eight
myths about hiring people with disabilities, and the OCC challenges
those myths with facts. Take a few moments to read through  “8 Myths
About Hiring People with Disabilities.”</p>

<h2>Accessible Hiring Practices</h2>
<p>In Ontario, the employment standards of the AODA describes
requirements for accessible employment practices, from recruitment
procedures, to employee accommodations, to performance management, and
more. As of January 1, 2017, all organizations in Ontario, including
small ones, must meet the AODA employment standards’s requirements.
These requirements are summarized below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notify employees and the public about the availability of job
accommodations for applicants with disabilities.</li>
<li>Ensure that the methods being used to advertise employment vacancies
are inclusive, with alternative formats available where
appropriate.</li>
<li>Notify prospective applicants that interview accommodations are
available upon request.</li>
<li>If an applicant requests accommodation, consult with the applicant
on suitable ways to provide those accommodations.</li>
<li>Upon making a job offer, and upon start of employment, notify
candidates of policies for accommodating employees with
disabilities.</li>
<li>Upon request, provide information in accessible formats to employees
needed to perform their job, as well as information generally available
to employees.</li>
<li>Provide personalized emergency-response information that takes into
account employees’s disabilities, and to a designated assistant if one
is required. Review emergency-response information if an employee moves
or changes jobs.</li>
<li>Have a process in place to document individual accommodation plans
(other than small organizations).</li>
<li>Upon return to work due to disability, develop an accommodation plan
for employees returning after an absence.</li>
<li>During performance reviews, take into account employee disabilities,
accessibility needs, and individual accommodation plans.</li>
<li>When career development is provided, take into account employee
disabilities, accessibility needs, and individual accommodation
plans.</li>
<li>When redeployment is provided, take into account employee
disabilities, accessibility needs, and individual accommodation
plans.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Employee Accommodation</h2>
<p>For employees with disabilities, employed in a role that involves
consuming or producing digital information, accommodations typically
include supplying assistive technologies that provide access to a
computer. If employees with disabilities do not already have a preferred
means of accommodation, they will often receive a workplace
accommodation assessment, typically conducted by an occupational
therapist (OC). The OC will recommend adjustments to workspaces to
accommodate a disability, as well as assistive software or hardware to
make possible or aid with tasks associated with particular roles that
involve using a computer.</p>
<p>The following is a list of potential accommodations that may be
required by people with disabilities. In most cases accommodation will
cost less than $1000, sometimes much less.</p>
<h3>People who are blind</h3>
<p>People who are blind will typically require a screen reader to access
a computer, which reads aloud the information on a computer screen. If
they are deafblind, or for blind users who read Braille, they may also
require a refreshable Braille display working along with a screen reader
to turn text on a computer screen into raised dots on a finger pad that
refreshes while navigating through the text.</p>
<h3>People with low vision</h3>
<p>People with low vision may or may not require a screen reader. Some
will require magnification software, while others will rely on
magnification built into the operating system or web browsers they may
be using.</p>
<h3>People who are deaf or hard of hearing</h3>
<p>For those with loss of hearing, they may not require assistive
technology beyond hearing aids. They may, however, require audio content
in alternative formats, typically written, and they may require
accommodations for meetings, either a scribe to take notes or use
instant messaging, or perhaps voice recognition software to transcribe
spoken words to a computer screen. Real-time captioning services may be
an option, connecting by phone or internet to a service that types what
is heard to be displayed on a computer screen.</p>
<p>Some people who are Deaf will be able to read lips. For this to be
effective, others need to be trained to be aware when they speak, that
their lips are in view for the person who is lip reading.</p>
<p>TTY (text telephone or teletypewriter) may also be required if a
person who is Deaf will be communicating by telephone. Video-relay
services, similar in nature to real-time captions, have a remote
interpreter listen and interpret to sign language, displayed on a
computer screen.</p>
<p>In some cases, particularly where ASL is the person’s first language,
a sign-language interpreter may be required. This can be an expensive
option, however. Augmentative communication devices might be used as an
alternative to sign-language interpreting, used to translate English
into ASL.</p>
<h3>People with cognitive disabilities</h3>
<p>Cognitive disabilities can be quite varied. Assistive technologies
are less likely to be required. Rather job accommodations may be needed,
aligning work duties with the capacity to comprehend and complete those
duties effectively. People with cognitive disabilities may be well
suited to take on entry level duties that are often not challenging
enough for others.</p>
<p>Other’s with cognitive disabilities such as autism, Asperger’s
Syndrome, and other pervasive developmental delays (PDDs), can be quite
intelligent in some respects, while having difficulties with social
interaction. They may be able to take on highly complex, specialized
tasks, but may need privacy or routine to function effectively.</p>
<h3>People with learning disabilities</h3>
<p>People with learning disabilities are typically as intelligent as
others, some more than average. They typically have difficulties in a
specific area, such as reading, or mathematics, or interpreting visual
input. In some cases, no accommodations are needed. For others, they may
required text-to-speech technology to read text aloud.</p>
<h3>People with fine-motor disabilities</h3>
<p>For those who have limited use of their hands, perhaps due to a
spinal-cord injury, or perhaps an inability to hold their hand steady
enough to handle a keyboard or mouse, a variety of assistive
technologies may be employed.</p>
<p>Speech recognition may be required by some, allowing them to speak
commands to a computer, or dictate text to a document. For those who
cannot handle a mouse or keyboard, technologies such as eye tracking, or
a head mouse, might be required to allow them to control a mouse
pointer, and press a large button switch that take the place of a mouse
click.</p>
<p>Some may require a keyboard with large keys, that are easier to
target with a shaky hand. Others may be accommodated with low-tech
solutions such as a keyboard cover with holes over each key that prevent
adjacent keys from being pressed.</p>
<h3>People using a wheelchair</h3>
<p>People using a wheelchair to accommodate loss of movement in their
legs typically do not need any assistive technology when interacting
with a computer. For those who have loss of movement in the arms and
legs, technologies like those described for fine-motor disabilities may
be required.</p>

<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>In terms of web accessibility, it is the web developer who must be
knowledgeable in implementing accessibility in web content. As much as
others may understand how and where barriers can affect access, it is
the developer who makes accessibility happen. A web developer usually
has a university-level computer science degree and/or special training
in developing for the Web.</p>
<p>Currently, there are few formal technical programs that provide
anything more than cursory coverage of web accessibility. As such, web
developers who are qualified to implement accessibility are often
self-taught. Finding a web developer with expert accessibility skills
can be a challenge, and it may mean settling for a person who simply
knows the basics about web accessibility. If you plan to hire a web/IT
accessibility specialist, hiring web developers with knowledge of
accessibility is less of an issue, since the specialist can oversee the
work of the developers and guide or train them (see the next page for
further details).</p>
<h2>Web Developers’ Accessibility Skills</h2>
<p>In addition to the skills that might be part of a standard job
description for a web developer, an Accessible Web Developer should also
have these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skilled use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
<li>Good understanding of WCAG 2.0, or local accessibility
guidelines</li>
<li>Knowledge of WAI-ARIA (preferably skilled use of)</li>
<li>Ability to effectively use JAWS or another screen reader</li>
<li>Familiarity with mobile screen readers</li>
<li>Familiarity with automated web-accessibility checking tools</li>
<li>Familiarity with browser-based accessibility-testing tools (plugins,
etc.)</li>
<li>Knowledge of accessibility issues in technologies such as Flash and
Java</li>
<li>Knowledge of cross-browser accessibility considerations</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can find a web developer with expert understanding and all the
skills needed to implement accessibility, hire that person. But, chances
are you will find people with some, but not all of these
characteristics. Hire the ones with the broadest backgrounds who are
resourceful enough to find answers to accessibility problems based on
familiarity with web accessibility as a whole.</p>

<p>When hiring staff, you can question them about their general
accessibility knowledge during the interview process. Though typically
not a requirement for most jobs, accessibility knowledge and skills
should be an asset when considering candidates. For most roles, except
perhaps web developer or procurement roles, role-related accessibility
knowledge and skills can be learned with a little training. Web
developers and purchasers will require a much broader understanding than
most other roles.</p>
<p>Below are examples of the types of questions that might be asked,
grouped by the knowledge area or skill type, with suggested answers.

<h2>Disability Sensitivity</h2>
<p>(Also see Customer Service section below)</p>
<p><strong>When a blind person using a white cane, enters your store,
how should you approach that person, and/or offer assistance?<br />
</strong>If the person appears to be be having difficulty, ask first
“Can I help you?” If the person answers yes, ask “How can I help you
best?” and follow their lead. Never assume a blind person, or any other
person with a disability, needs help. Some people will not want to be
helped, preferring independence.</p>
<p><strong>When a blind person enters your store with a service dog, how
should you address the dog entering your store or restaurant?<br />
</strong>The dog is working, and should be ignored. Do not pet the dog,
or address the dog directly unless the person suggests you may. The dog
must be allowed in the store or restaurant, though may be denied access
to food-preparation areas.</p>
<p><strong>You catch yourself saying “we’ll see each other later” to a
blind person, or you catch yourself saying “we have to run” to a person
in a wheelchair. How should you respond to these sayings?<br />
</strong>You do not need to respond. Phrases like these are a natural
part of daily life, and people with disabilities will not be offended by
them. They may, however, be offended by apologizing for the phrase.</p>
<h2>Organizational Requirements (Basic)</h2>
<p><strong>What accessibility regulations affect businesses in Ontario
(or some other location)?<br />
</strong>In Ontario, candidates should mention AODA. Bonus if IASR is
mentioned or the standards that make up this regulation.</p>
<p>In the U.S., mention section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</p>
<p>Refer to International Digital Accessibility Regulations in <a
href="#chapter-014-international-digital-accessibility-regulations.xhtml">Unit
2</a>, for regulations in other parts of the world.</p>
<p><strong>When are organizations in Ontario (or elsewhere) with 50+
employees required make their websites accessible?<br />
</strong>In Ontario, they should mention January 1, 2014, bonus if they
mention Level A, added bonus if they mention Level AA by 2021.</p>
<h2>Organizational Requirements (Detailed)</h2>
<p><strong>Which standard of the IASR (AODA) governs digital
accessibility requirements?<br />
</strong>The Information and Communication Standard.</p>
<p><strong>What standard are the web accessibility requirements of The
Information and Communication Standard, and other regulations around the
world, typically governed by?<br />
</strong>The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</p>
<p><strong>For organizations over 50 employees, what are the reporting
requirements under AODA?<br />
</strong>Section 4 of the regulation requires each obligated
organization to establish and implement a multi-year plan describing how
it will achieve its accessibility requirements under the regulation, and
post that plan to their website (if they have one). Plans must be
reviewed and updated every five years.</p>
<h2>Customer Service</h2>
<p><strong>When a person who is deaf is communicating with you through a
sign interpreter, how should you reply?<br />
</strong>Reply directly to the person, not to the interpreter. Reply
like you would reply to any person, looking directly at the person with
your mouth clearly in view. Enunciate words clearly and, if requested,
slow speech slightly to allow those who can lip read to more easily
visually interpret.</p>
<p><strong>If approached by a person with a prosthesis on their right
arm, how should you shake hands with that person?<br />
</strong>Shaking the left hand would be appropriate, or wait for the
person to extend a hand. If a person is unable to shake hands, touch
them lightly on the shoulder or arm to greet them.</p>
<p><strong>An adult person with a cognitive impairment (e.g., Down
syndrome) asks you for help. How should you respond?<br />
</strong>Respond to that person as you would any other adult customer.
You may want to slow your speech slightly and speak clearly. Do not
speak to the person as if they were a child. Do not speak through a
family member who might be with the person.</p>
<p><strong>A person in a wheelchair has approached you asking about a
particular product that requires an extended description. What might you
do to provide a respectful answer?<br />
</strong>Talk to the person like any other adult. If there is an
opportunity to sit, pull up a chair and address the person eye to
eye.</p>
<p><strong>A person with a speech impairment is asking you in a
stuttered voice, about the prices for a number of items, but is having
difficulty getting the words out. How should you respond?<br />
</strong>Be patient, and allow the person to finish speaking their
question. Do not attempt to finish their sentences for them. Do not
pretend to understand if you don’t. It is okay to say “I’m not sure I
understand.” If they try again and you are still unable to understand,
ask if the person would like to write the question, if the person is
able.</p>
<h2>Basic Web Accessibility</h2>
<p><strong>How would you make an image in a web page accessible to
someone who is blind?<br />
</strong>Add alt text to the image HTML to describe the meaningful
elements of the image and, if necessary, provide a more detailed
description in a caption or in the surrounding text.</p>
<p><strong>When writing an article for the Web, how would you go about
structuring the document to make it usable by someone using a screen
reader?<br />
</strong>Use proper HTML headings to organize sections and subsections,
instead of using large bold text. Use proper list HTML to organize items
arranged in a list, rather than using asterisks or separating items with
a new line.</p>
<h2>Document Accessibility</h2>
<p><strong>When preparing a Microsoft Word document, what can be done to
make the document accessible to people who are blind?<br />
</strong>Provide text descriptions for images. Arrange content using
proper headings. Use table headers when presenting data in tables.</p>
<p><strong>How would you make a PDF document accessible to a blind
person, reading it with a screen reader?<br />
</strong>If exported from Microsoft Word, make the Word document
accessible first. Open the exported PDF in a current version of Adobe
Acrobat Pro, and use its accessibility features to adjust the document.
Use the reading order feature in Acrobat Pro to adjust the order in
which the parts of each page are read, if necessary.</p>
<h2>Role-Based Knowledge</h2>
<p><strong>What accessibility knowledge is needed by staff who are
producing documents for public distribution?<br />
</strong>Be able to use the accessibility test tools in Word or in
Acrobat Pro, for example, to test and make adjustments to documents.
Must be aware of accessibility features in document authoring tools,
such as how to add alt text for images or create table headers.</p>
<p><strong>When hiring counter/sales staff, what knowledge of
accessibility/disability is needed?<br />
</strong>They must be sensitive to people with disabilities. Speak to
people with disabilities like you would speak to anyone else. Ask before
attempting to help. Sit, if possible, when having a conversation with a
person in a wheelchair. Do not interact with service animals. Speak
directly to the person with a disability, not through their support
person. Must be familiar with local customer service accessibility
laws.</p>
<p><strong>What accessibility knowledge or skills is needed by a person
being hired for a web development position?<br />
</strong>Web developers must be familiar with WCAG (specifically,
principles, levels, success criteria, and techniques). Should be able to
name a screen reader or two for accessibility testing (e.g., JAWS, NVDA,
Window Eyes, ChromeVox, and others). Must be familiar with accessibility
testing tools (and name a few, and what they are used for). Should be
familiar with WAI-ARIA, used when developing interactive elements in
websites or web applications. Understanding issues associated with mouse
and keyboard access. Must be familiar with the types of barriers people
with different types of disabilities encounter.</p>
<p><strong>When hiring a manager, what accessibility knowledge do they
need?<br />
</strong>They must be familiar with the local accessibility laws and be
able to describe the legislation and its requirements. They should
understand the types of accessibility knowledge that should be possessed
by the people reporting to them. They should be familiar with
accessibility tools and resources their staff can access.</p>
<p><strong>When hiring a marketing and communications person, what do
they need to know about accessibility?<br />
</strong>They should have a basic understanding of web and document
accessibility, such as providing alternatives for visuals, structuring
documents, using tools to test for accessibility. Must understand issues
associated with using colour in an accessible way (e.g., contrast,
alternatives for colour with meaning).</p>
<p><strong>When hiring a human-resource person, what do they need to
know about accessibility?<br />
</strong>Human-resource people should be aware of role-based
accessibility knowledge required for an organization’s various
roles.</p>
<h2>Accessible Employment Practices</h2>
<p><strong>What can be done to ensure that people with disabilities have
an equal opportunity to apply for jobs as their able peers?<br />
</strong>Employers should inform applicants that accommodations are
available on request in relation to materials and processes used.</p>
<p>If accommodations are requested, the employer must consult with the
applicant on suitable accommodations that account for the applicant’s
disability.</p>
<p>If hired, the hiring notification sent to the applicant will take
into consideration the applicant’s disability and include the
organization’s policy for accommodating employees with disabilities.</p>
<h2>Multimedia</h2>
<p><strong>What potential accommodations can be included with video to
ensure it is accessible to people with disabilities?<br />
</strong>To accommodate people who are deaf, captions can be
included.</p>
<p>To accommodate people who are blind, audio description, or extended
audio description can be added to video that describe actions or the
context, that might otherwise not be understood by listening to the
audio track of a video.</p>
<p><strong>What potential accommodations can be included with audio to
ensure it is accessible to people with disabilities?<br />
</strong>To accommodate people who are deaf, a transcript can be
included with audio.</p>
<h2>Universal Design</h2>
<p><strong>In what ways does universal design address web accessibility
for people with disabilities, while at the same time improving usability
for everyone?<br />
</strong>This can potentially be a long list. These are some
examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create link text that is meaningful, avoiding links like “click
here.” Able and disabled people can scan links of a page more easily
without having to follow links to see where they lead.</li>
<li>Prevent errors from occurring using effective prompting, feedback
messaging, and data validation. Ensures everyone is prevented from
submitting incorrect data.</li>
<li>When presenting visual content, also include text describing the
meaningful element of the visual. Provide a text description for those
who cannot see and describe the visual for those who might not
understand the meaningful elements of the visual.</li>
<li>Use relative measures to size elements in web content so it easily
adapts to magnification, and to a variety of device screen sizes.</li>
<li>Include redundant modalities, such as including a visual cue, like a
flash, when an audio cue, like a beep, is presented, for those who
cannot hear, or those who have audio turned down.</li>
</ul>

examples of universal design for a accessibility</a>
</div>
<h2>Procurement</h2>
<p><strong>When purchasing software to be used on a website, when is it
appropriate to use software that may not be accessibility
compliant?<br />
</strong>When no accessible alternative exists.</p>
<p>When the cost is excessive and would create undue hardship for the
organization.</p>
<p>Otherwise, when comparable products are available to choose from, the
more accessible option should be procured.</p>
<p><strong>What questions should be asked in a Request for Proposals
(RFPs), when purchasing software to be used on the Web?<br />
</strong>This can potentially be a long list. These are some
examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can the software be used effectively without the need to use a
mouse?</li>
<li>Can the software be magnified to at least 200% (and 400%) using
browser settings, without information being lost off the side of the
screen?</li>
<li>Does contrast between text and background throughout the user
interface meet WCAG 2 requirements?</li>
<li>What testing was done to ensure the user interface of your
application will be usable by people using assistive technology?</li>
<li>What processes do you have in place to address accessibility issues,
should they be discovered after we have licensed your software?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In addition to asking for accessibility in RFPs, what other
things must be considered when purchasing software?<br />
</strong>This can potentially be a long list. These are some
examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaluate vendor responses critically. Some may provide answers
without experience or knowledge of specific requirements.</li>
<li>Complete your own testing of the software to confirm vendor claims.
Or, ask for an unbiased third party accessibility review.</li>
<li>Ensure that contractual arrangements address ongoing maintenance of
accessibility, for instance, during upgrades or software updates, or
when previous undetected accessibility issues are discovered.</li>

an accessibility professional and putting together a job description for
their position is likely to be an activity an organization will need to
undertake in its efforts to develop a culture of accessibility. When you
are developing your own accessibility job description, it can be helpful
to see what other organizations are looking for in an accessibility
professional.</p>
<p>Spend a few moments with your favourite search engine and try to
locate examples of job postings for accessibility professionals. Select
one or two positions and write up a short summary of them. Include
information like the location, company name, salary, years of experience
needed, etc.</p>
<p>Here are a few search terms you can use to get started. Use your
imagination to come up with other potential search terms that would turn
up similar positions. Try adding a city name to your search terms to
find positions close to you.</p>

<h2>Unit 1 Summary</h2>
<p>This unit is aimed at getting you familiar with the materials and how
to make the most of this learning experience.</p>
<h2>Unit 2 Summary</h2>
<p>In this unit, you learned the following points about understanding
accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a business addresses digital accessibility, it actually saves
money and doing so is not a non-recoverable cost to the business.</li>
<li>There is a strong potential for a significant increase in customers
for businesses that address digital accessibility.</li>
<li>Digital accessibility should not be an afterthought but rather it
needs to be part of the business strategy and the daily operations of
the business.</li>
<li>Addressing accessibility is a quality attribute of business and
improves its profile.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unit 3 Summary</h2>
<p>In this unit, you learned these aspects about establishing a digital
accessibility committee:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disability sensitivity training, a good understanding of
accessibility and standards such as WCAG, and accessibility barriers are
all key knowledge areas required in different company roles.</li>
<li>Accessibility committee members should be chosen strategically and
should represent a good cross-section of the business.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unit 4 Summary</h2>
<p>In this unit, you learned the following about creating a digital
accessibility culture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility auditing is an important step. Choosing a reputable
service involves careful consideration focusing on key reputability
factors.</li>
<li>Two approaches to accessible websites are retrofitting and starting
over. The correct approach for your situation will need to consider
several factors including outsourcing the work to external vendors.</li>
<li>Building a company-wide strategy about accessibility includes
building awareness, hiring people with disabilities, focused
presentations, and training.</li>
<li><em>Web development accessibility</em> guidelines focus on user
interaction with a website whereas <em>web content accessibility</em>
guidelines focus more on standards compliance. Both are important.</li>
<li>Several approaches should be used to monitor adherence to
accessibility guidelines including unbiased quality assurance reviews
and the use of automated tools.</li>
<li>Implementing accessibility will include managing change. Kotter’s
Eight-Step Model for Leading Change and Lewin’s Three-Step Model are two
common models that can help when planning and facilitating the
implementation.</li>
<li>Resistance by staff may be the most challenging element in
implementing change and overcoming the five main reasons people resist
change needs to be part of your change management strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unit 5 Summary</h2>
<p>In this unit, you learned the following about procurement and
accessibility policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be successful, an effective web accessibility policy should be
rooted within the business culture following the WebAIM eight-step
process.</li>
<li>A web accessibility policy should include procurement practices for
both IT and non-IT related goods and services.</li>
<li>Vendors should be able to verify and validate the accessibility
compliance of their products and services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unit 6 Summary</h2>
<p>In this unit, you learned the following points about hiring
accessibility staff:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies are missing out on a significant talent pool of highly
educated and skilled workers when they exclude people with disabilities
in their hiring practices.</li>
<li>Few formal technical training programs focus on developing
accessible web content thus creating self-taught specialists who teach
themselves independently. These specialists will have some common
knowledge as well as informal personal skill sets related to accessible
content.</li>

<h1>Sharp Clothing Company Digital Accessibility Policy</h1>
<p>Effective Date: July 7, 2017</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Why is a digital accessibility policy necessary?</p>
<p>The Sharp Clothing Company (the company), being based in Ontario,
Canada, is required under the <em>Accessibility for Ontarians with
Disabilities Act</em> (AODA 2005), to ensure its digital information is
accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
<h2>Commitment</h2>
<p>The Company is committed to improving and maintaining access to its
digital information. First, as a social responsibility, to ensure no one
is excluded from working at, or being a customer of, the company.
Second, in its efforts to expand its market coverage, the company will
ensure its accessibility standards meet those for an international
audience.</p>
<h2>Accessibility Committee</h2>
<p>The Accessibility Committee (AC) will be made up of senior
representatives and knowledgeable staff from each of the company’s
departments. The committee will meet quarterly and when necessary to
address significant accessibility-related issues.</p>
<p>The AC will be led by the accessibility coordinator (i.e., the
Accessibility Champion).</p>
<h3>Scope and Goals</h3>
<p>The AC will be responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising accessibility awareness</li>
<li>Encouraging feedback to share problems and solutions</li>
<li>Implementing quality-assurance procedures</li>
<li>Handling legal matters related to accessibility</li>
<li>Providing web and digital accessibility support</li>
<li>Developing internal accessibility standards</li>
<li>Representing the organization in public affairs related to
accessibility</li>
</ul>
<h3>Authority and Enforcement</h3>
<p>The AC will have the authority to make adjustments to current
processes throughout the company to ensure that accessibility
requirements are being met.</p>
<p>The AC will also have the authority to delay release of products to
the public, if accessibility does not meet company accessibility
standards.</p>
<p>The AC will have the authority to recommend dismissal of staff who
are unwilling to follow or repeatedly disregard the company’s
accessibility standards or policies.</p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>The accessibility coordinator will be the main point of contact for
company staff who have questions or concerns related to digital
accessibility.</p>
<p>The accessibility coordinator will be the main point of contact for
the public with digital accessibility–related enquiries.</p>
<p>The AC will maintain a digital accessibility knowledge base within
the company’s main website, which will be available for all staff.</p>
<p>In the Contact Us form on the company website, “accessibility” will
be included as a reason for the contact among the other given options.
When selected, enquiries will be sent directly to the accessibility
coordinator. The accessibility coordinator will direct the enquiry to
the appropriate person (if required) as soon as it is feasible to do so,
or will respond as soon as possible, taking no longer than 24 hours to
reply.</p>
<h2>Guidelines and Standards</h2>
<p>The AC will be responsible for developing and maintaining a set of
company digital accessibility guidelines. These guidelines will
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Website and Web Application Accessibility Guidelines</li>
<li>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</li>
<li>Document Accessibility Guidelines</li>
<li>Multimedia Accessibility Guidelines</li>
</ul>
<h3>Website Development</h3>
<p>The company websites, or any website or application created after
this policy is issued, shall meet WCAG Level AA requirements outlined in
the company’s Website and Web Application Accessibility Guidelines,
except where it is unrealistic to do so or where undue hardship has been
established.</p>
<p>Undue hardship will be determined by the AC in cases where the cost
is excessive, where technology or an equivalent does not exist in an
accessible form, where health or safety are at risk, and where external
funding is unavailable to assist with excessive costs.</p>
<h3>Website Content</h3>
<p>All content added to the website after this policy is issued shall
meet WCAG Level AA requirements outlined in the company’s Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines.</p>
<h3>Documents and Communications</h3>
<p>All documents and communications authored after this policy is issued
will meet the requirements of the company’s Document Accessibility
Guidelines.</p>
<h3>Multimedia</h3>
<p>All multimedia produced by the company after this policy is issued
will have captions for video and transcripts for audio, as outlined in
the company’s Multimedia Accessibility Guidelines.</p>
<h3>Third-Party Digital Content</h3>
<p>Where third-party documents, web content, or web applications are
used after all effort has been made to obtain these in an accessible
form, the company will not be responsible for their lack of
accessibility, and the company will acknowledge this fact in a way that
is accessible and easily discoverable by customers or employees.</p>
<h2>Hiring Equity and Employment Accommodation</h2>
<p>The company will make an effort to hire qualified people with
disabilities, and where candidate qualifications are comparable, favour
the person with a disability.</p>
<p>The company will question candidates about digital accessibility
related to the position for which the candidate is applying; and where
candidates are comparable, the company will favour those with more
accessibility knowledge.</p>
<p>The company will provide appropriate assistive technology or other
accommodation for any employee making such a request and can demonstrate
an associated disability.</p>
<p>The company will establish and maintain a full-time Accessibility
Specialist position and, within one year of this policy being
established, hire a person with digital accessibility expertise for the
role of accessibility coordinator or to act as a consultant, taking on
the role of Accessibility Engineer within the company’s IT group.</p>
<h2>Training and Awareness</h2>
<p>The AC will develop and maintain a series of educational units on
various aspects of digital accessibility, consisting of documents,
videos, web-based training, and in-class workshops, that will be offered
periodically to ensure staff are adequately trained on accessibility
issues associated with their position. These units will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessible Document Authoring</li>
<li>How People with Disabilities Use the Web</li>
<li>Basic Web Accessibility</li>
<li>Advanced Web Accessibility with WAI-ARIA</li>
<li>Web Accessibility Auditing</li>
<li>Multimedia Captioning</li>
</ul>
<p>The AC will also be responsible for creating and maintaining an
accessibility statement to be linked prominently on the main website.
The statement will describe the company’s commitment to accessibility
and outlines accessibility features available on the website to assist
users navigating the site with assistive technology.</p>
<h2>Digital Accessibility Resources</h2>
<p>The AC will establish and maintain the company’s accessibility
knowledge base, which will contain a variety of resources including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The company accessibility guidelines</li>
<li>Documentation on web and document accessibility methods</li>
<li>Instructional videos on digital accessibility</li>
<li>Annual accessibility reports</li>
<li>Templates for Requests for Proposals (RFP) and contract
accessibility wording</li>
<li>Promotional items to highlight company accessibility efforts</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procurement</h2>
<p>All Requests for Proposals (RFP) involving digital content or
products will include wording that requests details regarding a
product’s accessibility. Accessibility will be prioritized when judging
proposals, so that lack of accessibility is likely to disqualify or
significantly disadvantage a vendor.</p>
<p>Contracts with vendors will include language that commits the vendor
to supplying products at an agreed-upon level of accessibility. Vendors
will be obligated to address accessibility issues not previously
acknowledged and/or dismissed.</p>
<p>Purchasing will acquire products and service that are the most
accessible, except in cases where there is not a satisfactory or
comparable product with a given set of features or functionality that
provides accessibility.</p>
<p>The AC will prepare templates for RFP and contract language and
maintain them through the company’s accessibility knowledge base.</p>
<h2>Accessibility Auditing and Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>Accessibility quality assurance will be added to and maintained
throughout the company’s processes. Before digital content is
distributed publicly, it must be reviewed by someone other than the
author who is familiar with the accessibility elements that the type of
content being reviewed entails. This will include all documents, content
posted to the websites, and promotional materials distributed to the
public.</p>
<p>In the case of website development, the author’s code will be
reviewed by another knowledgeable IT staff member; and before the
development is made available to the public, it will be reviewed by the
accessibility coordinator. Where the accessibility coordinator
identifies issues, those issues must be corrected on the recommendation
of the accessibility coordinator.</p>
<h2>Monitoring and Periodic Reviews</h2>
<p>The accessibility coordinator will be responsible for conducting
periodic spot checks on digital content and for conducting annual
accessibility audits on the company’s websites.</p>
<p>Any issues identified during checks and audits will be directed to
those responsible for the content in question, who will be required to
address the issues as instructed by the accessibility coordinator.</p>
<p>In cases where checks fail consistently, the accessibility
coordinator will arrange additional training for the employee(s)
responsible for the failures.</p>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>Following the annual audit of the company’s websites, the
accessibility coordinator, with the assistance of the AC, will produce a
formal report on the accessibility status of the company’s websites. The
status report will be presented at the next quarterly senior management
meeting and archived in the accessibility knowledge base.</p>
<h2>Policy Review</h2>
<p>This policy will be reviewed annually by the AC and adjustments made
where necessary. If modified, the policy will be approved by the
company’s senior director within 30 days of the update.</p>

information technology. He has been involved in e-learning just as long,
with more than 20 online courses to his name. He is the originator of
the ATutor and AContent open source e-learning systems started in the
late 1990s, both designed to model accessibility in online learning. He
teaches a variety of workshops, both technical and non-technical,
evangelizing inclusive design as a best practice for building IT systems
that are usable by everyone.</p>
