Document History 
Version Date Change 1.0 2013-08-07 Initial release 1.0 2013-10-10 Editorial and typographical corrections. 1.01 2014-02-11 Changed two "Machine" checks to "Human", updated the description on page 2, formatting changes to improve maintenance, added headings and a Table of Contents to improve navigability. 1.02 2014-04-30 Minor editorial and formatting corrections, moved 08-003 to 01-007. Background 
PDF is the electronic document format found worldwide in every corner of almost every organization that uses computers. The value of PDF may be stated in terms of the capacity to deliver a stable and trustworthy representation of a document. 
 
Accordingly, PDF implementers have a special responsibility to ensure reliability and consistency in PDF processing by following clear, specific and detailed industry and normative standards in the development of PDF creation, modification and viewing software. 
About PDF/UA 
Ensuring content is accessible to users with disabilities presents broad and complex challenges in any technology. ISO 14289-1 (PDF/UA-1) specifies technical requirements for PDF files to ensure a highquality and consistent reading experience when used by a variety of PDF/UA-conforming processors. 
Introduction to the Matterhorn Protocol 
Templates and document production processes can automate many aspects of accessibility but the range of necessary checkpoints is extensive and human judgment is required in many areas.  
 
Organizations committed to providing accessible electronic documents require a cost-effective means of ensuring their document's accessibility features are adequate. 
 
Intended for software developers and document testers, the Matterhorn Protocol is designed to foster PDF/UA adoption by specifying a common set of tests to facilitate the exchange of detailed information on PDF/UA conformance. 
 
NOTE: The concepts of "partial conformance" and "severity of non-conformance" are intentionally not addressed in this document. 
 	 
Matterhorn Protocol Checkpoints 
The Matterhorn Protocol is a set of 31 checkpoints comprised of 136 failure conditions encompassing file format requirements specified in PDF/UA-1. 87 failure conditions can be determined by software alone, 47 failure conditions usually require human judgment. 2 failure conditions have no specific tests (23-001 and 27-001). Some failure conditions pertain to the document, some to the page and most to individual objects such as tags, tables or annotations. 
Key to the Headers in the Failure Conditions Tables 
Index A numerical identifier for individual failure conditions within a given Checkpoint. Failure Condition Non-conforming condition present in the PDF file.  
NOTE: Pathological software behavior (such as "flickering" by using a script to cause animation effects via a series of actions) is not addressed. Section A reference to the relevant section in PDF/UA on a paragraph level. "UA1" refers to the PDF/UA-1 standard. The point-separated numbers after the colon refer to a clause in PDF/UA-1. The digits following the hyphen identify a specific paragraph within the clause. Type 	 The nature of the tested item. Possible values are Doc for aspects of the document as a whole, Page for pages inside the document, Object for individual data objects, JS for JavaScript embedded in the document and All where all aspects of the document are affected. How While not determinative the value of How generally indicates the realistic best-practice approach at the present time. Some checkpoints may always be decided by Machine, some usually or probably require Human interaction. See Certain failure conditions are covered in full by other failure conditions. Such cases are indicated by an index reference in this column. Additional Reading

PDF/UA-1 Failure Conditions 
Checkpoint 01: Real content tagged 
Index Failure Condition Section Type How See 01-001 Artifact is tagged as real content. UA1:7.1-1 Object Human - 01-002 Real content is marked as artifact. UA1:7.1-1 Object Human - 01-003 Content marked as Artifact is present inside tagged content. UA1:7.1-1 Object Machine - 01-004 Tagged content is present inside content marked as Artifact. UA1:7.1-1 Object Machine - 01-005 Content is neither marked as Artifact nor tagged as real content. UA1:7.1-2 Object Machine - 01-006 The structure type and attributes of a structure element are not semantically appropriate for the structure element. All of the following structure types must be taken into account: 
 
Document, Part, Art, Sect, Div, BlockQuote, Caption, 
TOC, TOCI, Index, NonStruct, Private, P, H, H1, H2, H3, 
H4, H5, H6, L, LI, Lbl, LBody, Table, TR, TH, TD, THead, 
TBody, TFoot, Span, Quote, Note, Reference, BibEntry, Code, Link, Annot, Ruby, Warichu, RB, RT, RP, WT, WP, Figure, Formula, Form. 
 
NOTE 1: Structure type is not semantically appropriate if the nature of the content inside the structure element does not match the structure type of the structure element.  
 
NOTE 2: For any non-standard structure types, the standard structure type to which the type is rolemapped shall be used for validation. 
 
NOTE 3: Tables are regular when the number of logical cells is equal in each row after accounting for rowspan and colspan attributes. 
 
While PDF/UA-1 does not prohibit irregular tables, irregular tables are almost always a strong indicator of improper table structure. It may be a good idea to raise a warning when such tables are encountered, but it is not required by the Matterhorn Protocol. 
 
NOTE 4: The value of table cell attributes is a function of the cell's semantic role in the table's structure. Therefore, a TH cell may not include a Scope attribute with an inappropriate value. UA1:7.1-2 Object Human - 01-007 Suspect entry has a value of true. UA1:7.1-11 Doc Machine -  
Checkpoint 02: Role Mapping 
Index Failure Condition Section Type How See 02-001 One or more non-standard tag's mapping does not terminate with a standard type. 
 
NOTE: Although PDF/UA defines the nomenclature for heading levels above H6 (Hn), these are not standard structure types (as defined in ISO 32000-1) and therefore Hn tags must (PDF/UA-1 7.1, paragraph 1) be rolemapped to a standard structure type. According to PDF/UA-1, PDF/UA-conforming processors are expected to ignore such mappings and respect the heading level. UA1:7.1-3 Doc Machine - 02-002 The mapping of one or more non-standard types is semantically inappropriate. UA1:7.1-3 Doc Human - 02-003 A circular mapping exists. UA1:7.1-3 Doc Machine - 02-004 One or more standard types are remapped. UA1:7.1-4 Doc Machine - Checkpoint 03: Flickering 
Index Failure Condition Section Type How See 03-001 One or more Actions lead to flickering. UA1:7.1-5 Page Human - 03-002 One or more multimedia objects contain flickering content. UA1:7.1-5 Object Human - 03-003 One or more JavaScript actions lead to flickering. UA1:7.1-5 JS Human - Checkpoint 04: Color and Contrast 
Index Failure Condition Section Type How See 04-001 Information is conveyed by contrast, color, format or layout, or some combination thereof but the content is not tagged to reflect all meaning conveyed by the use of contrast, color, format or layout, or some combination thereof. UA1:7.1-6 Object Human - Checkpoint 05: Sound 
Index Failure Condition Section Type How See 05-001 Media annotation present, but audio content not available in another form. 
 
NOTE 1: An example of another form is a transcript. UA1:7.1-7 Object Human - 05-002 Audio annotation present, but content not available in another form. 
 
NOTE 2: An example of another form is a transcript. UA1:7.1-7 Object Human - 05-003 JavaScript uses beep function but does not provide another means of notification. UA1:7.1-7 JS Human - Checkpoint 06: Metadata 
Index Failure Condition Section Type How See 06-001 Document does not contain XMP metadata stream UA1:7.1-8 Doc Machine - 06-002 The metadata stream in the Catalog dictionary does not include the PDF/UA identifier. UA1:5 Doc Machine - 06-003 Metadata stream does not contain dc:title UA1:7.1-8 Doc Machine - 06-004 dc:title does not clearly identify the document UA1:7.1-8 Doc Human - Checkpoint 07: Dictionary 
Index Failure Condition Section Type How See 07-001 ViewerPreferences dictionary of the Catalog dictionary does not contain DisplayDocTitle key. UA1:7.1-9 Doc Machine - 07-002 ViewerPreferences dictionary of the Catalog dictionary contains DisplayDocTitle key with a value of false. UA1:7.1-9 Doc Machine - Checkpoint 08: OCR Validation
