What are captions?
Captions are text descriptions of dialogue and background music or sound which provides the same level of information as one would get from hearing the audio. Text should be synchronized and equivalent with audio. 
Two types of Captions:
1. Closed: The viewer can toggle the captions on or off when needed.
2. Open: Viewer cannot toggle captions on or off.
• Use text that is easy to read (good font size and color contrast), consistent, clear, and errorless.
• Caption quality is crucial 
• Every pre-recorded video should have captions. 
• There is no standard size for captions- they vary based on the size of your video player window. However, if you must squint to read your captions, the font size is too small.

Captions vs. Subtitles 
Captions and subtitles are similar, but they are distinct from each other.
* Captions: text descriptions of dialogue and background sound or music thus providing equivalent information as one would get from hearing the audio
* Subtitles: straightforward translations of video's dialogue
For example, a bilingual English/Spanish website, we would have clearly labeled captions (for English text) and subtitles (for Spanish text).
Transcripts
What are transcripts?
        Text versions of media content that includes dialogue, descriptions of actions or important information on-screen There are two types of transcripts:
1. Static: transcripts presented in plain text
2. Interactive: transcripts with highlight words as they're spoken in the video. This allows viewers follow along, and search across the spoken audio of a video and play from any point in the video by clicking within the transcript.
In addition, transcripts help students to get the information they want quickly, learn the spelling of technical terms spoken, and take notes for comprehension.
Audio Descriptions (1 of 2)

• Audio descriptions are additional audio tracks that describe by a voice-over narrator and give context for essential visual information (e.g. actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and other visual content). 
• This helps describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone.

Audio descriptions are commonly used for pre-recorded material such as video tutorials, video resources, and instructional videos. 
• Access for individuals who are blind and low vision
• Literacy
• Auditory learners
• English language learners
• Autism spectrum
• No access to visual contentAudio Descriptions (2 of 2)
• The goal is to make the visual information in media accessible to people who are blind and have limited vision, but others may benefit from the explicit explanations as well.
• If videos are created with accessibility in mind, audio descriptions are probably aren't necessary, as long as important visual elements of the video are described in the audio track itself (e.g. man speaking at a podium for static presentation).
• For example, you do not need audio description for talking heads only, or for text on slides as long as the slide text is woven into what you say.


Accessible Video Best Practices (1 of 2)
When creating your own videos, you can ensure they are accessible with these simple steps:
• Use clear and simple language.
• Provide sufficient contrast between the text and background. Use Colour Contrast 
Analyser tool to ensure accessible contrast.
• Ensure text is comprehensible and has good font size.
• All audio information has a corresponding visual information and vice versa.
• Allow enough time for people to take in all of the important visual information. • Present text in blocks (e.g. complete sentence).
• Be mindful of how color is used.
• Don't add flashing elements, unnecessary motion or noises. It can be distracting and cause trigger seizures.
• If featuring a speaker, make their face visible and have them speak slowly and clearly.

Automated Captions for Accuracy
Creators/owners should review auto-generated captions for accuracy. Accuracy highly dependent on audio quality.
• Vocabulary	• Limited punctuation
• Terminology	• Limited speaker identification
• Acronyms	• Incorrect words choice do not match the spoken audio (e.g. 
Can vs. Can't, Know vs. No, Here vs. Hear)
• Names	• Add sound effects and music if applicable (e.g. [water 
• Locations	dripping], [upbeat music], [audience cheering], [balloon pops], 
etc.) Descriptive captions help to ensure the viewers have full 
• Unusual words	experience of the sound and enjoy the media.
