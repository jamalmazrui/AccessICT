<p>Without access to ICTs, which include assistive technologies or
specially-developed ICTs,</p>
<p>people with disabilities are disenfranchised and are denied equal
access to education, culture,</p>
<p>and everyday services. This ends up restricting their job
opportunities and their possibility for</p>
<p>independent living. As a blind person myself, using ICTs is what
enabled me to finish my school</p>
<p>and university education and complete my academic training, master’s
degree and internships.</p>
<p>Access to ICTs has been vital for me to achieve full participation in
all aspects of life and society,</p>
<p>and will continue to be so for the rest of my life. I frequently use
the Internet and digital librar-</p>
<p>ies, and can access information about basic things for independent
daily living, such as public</p>
<p>health information. ICTs have enabled me to access books for pleasure
and for education, and I</p>
<p>benefit from audio-description to enjoy culture through cinema,
museums and documentaries.</p>
<p>ICTs help me use my bank account through ATMs, find my way around
cities on my own guided</p>
<p>by maps and GPS, accessing crucial information such as public
transport routes and timetables.</p>
<p>Through ICTs I benefit from e-government services and regularly make
electronic payments.</p>
<p>ICTs also make it possible for me to communicate on an equal basis
with others.</p>
<p>If you cannot access education, you cannot get access to the labour
market and you cannot</p>
<p>achieve independent living. Although my academic background provided
me with the knowl-</p>
<p>edge and skills necessary for exciting career possibilities that
would not have been possible</p>
<p>without proper access to ICTs either through universal design or
through assistive technology.</p>
<p>Therefore, ICTs are the key that opens the door to full participation
for people with disabilities.</p>

<p>In addition to already-existing interactive and accessible services
provided by new technologies such as standards-based IPTV, a new
development in broadcasting will make access services available via
Integrated Broadcast-Broadband (IBB) systems. As with IPTV, IBB content
delivery via broadband telecommunication networks allows the
representation of access service exactly according to the needs of the
persons with disabilities without causing any disturbance to those that
do not need these services. In this case, the access services can be
displayed (video, images, sound, text, graphics and data) either on the
main screen (or the main loudspeakers) or on a second screen (normally a
type of tablet PC). By means of the second screen, persons with
disabilities are individually served even when watching TV together with
their friends or their family.</p>

<p>Communication is essential to all forms of social interaction and
participation and tech-</p>
<p>nology helps people to communicate in many effective ways. Indeed,
widespread ICT</p>
<p>usage and increasing integration of ICTs into in every aspect of life
plays an important role</p>
<p>in building societies that are more inclusive for persons with
disabilities. ICTs can help</p>
<p>ensure that persons with disabilities have a greater access to
knowledge and independent</p>
<p>living. However, there are a few principles that should be taken into
consideration while of</p>
<p>introducing ICTs.</p>
<p>First, ICTs needs to be accessible to all persons and not just to
persons with disabilities. All</p>
<p>persons ought to be able to access ICTs that help to facilitate
communication in different</p>
<p>cultural, educational, and professional situations.</p>
<p>Another principle is that particular forms or approaches to ICT
should reflect the goal of</p>
<p>fostering greater participation and inclusion. Mobile technologies,
for example, enable</p>
<p>access for everyone, including persons with disabilities, to access
services at the time of</p>
<p>need, thus unleashing huge potential for independent living within
inclusive societies.</p>
<p>Additionally, where possible, technologies ought to be designed to be
as inclusive as possi-</p>
<p>ble to all persons, as opposed to further development of certain
technologies that would</p>
<p>only be used specifically by persons with disabilities. This is
important to help facilitate</p>
<p>greater inclusion and universal accessibility to mainstream
communication technologies.</p>
<p>Naturally there will be some circumstances where specialized
technologies are necessary,</p>
<p>but these will become increasingly rare as technology becomes more
universally available.</p>
<h1 id="section-18">25</h1>
<p>A further important principle refers to the level of independence and
control persons with disabilities have in their use of ICTs. Indeed, all
persons, including those with disabilities have personal preferences for
particular technologies and they ought to be able to choose the ICT that
best serves them. It is important to take into consideration that the
primary purpose of any ICT is that it be controlled to fulfil the
functions required by its user.</p>
<p>Finally, it is critical to consider behaviour of the community that
surrounds persons with disabilities. Communication that harnesses ICT
may require more time than conventional speech processes. For this
reason, members of the community should be aware of the importance of
waiting for ICT-aided communication; those involved in teaching
processes can model this for the larger community. ICT training courses
should play a part in stand-ard teacher training programs so that
educators become aware of the different uses and users of
technologies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, these general principles may guide decisions about the
types of technolo-gies that should be used. With that said, important
questions remain in terms of content accessibility. There is a clear
need for standards to be developed that ensure that ICT is used to make
content more accessible in different forms for persons with varying
abilities and disabilities.</p>

<p>Librarians as information providers ought to serve as a centre of
expertise where persons</p>
<p>with disabilities may seek advice on accessing e-content suited to
their specific</p>
<p>set of abilities.</p>
<p>The provision of this public service would require library
professionals to develop</p>
<p>awareness of the following points and principles during their
training on disability-</p>
<p>related issues:</p>
<p>Firstly, they should have a broad knowledge of different digital
formats, and their varying</p>
<p>accessibility for persons with diverse learning needs. For example,
the appearance of text</p>
<p>on screen does not necessarily mean that it is accessible. Library
professionals ought to be</p>
<p>able to access alternative formats of content suited to users’
specific needs.</p>
<p>Library professionals should also be familiar with emerging e-reading
systems and of</p>
<p>what the market is or will be able to provide in terms of e-reading.
E-readers vary in their</p>
<p>settings and user technology, and librarians should be able to advise
on their specificities</p>
<p>for readers who prefer not to use printed books. In addition,
librarians should have knowl-</p>
<p>edge on specialized libraries (for instance “library of the blind”)
and other providers that</p>
<p>exist to meet the varied demands of persons with disabilities.</p>
<h1 id="section-22">29</h1>
<p>Finally, they ought to have a general understanding of the ways
different disabilities affect reading abilities so as to help persons
with disabilities efficiently. Librarians should receive disability
sensitisation and awareness-raising on the rights of persons with
disabilities as part of their own learning curriculum and continuing
education.</p>
<p>Libraries and library associations with knowledge and experience in
facilitating persons with disabilities’ access to information can serve
as helpful sources of information on how libraries and ICT developers
can meet the relevant needs of persons with disabilities. With that
said, the privacy of clients with disabilities’ user data needs to must
be maintained on an equal basis with that of other clients.</p>
<p>With this role as a service provider to persons with disabilities,
libraries can also play an important role as data-providers for
industry. For example, if sanctioned by a national law register, they
may benefit ICT companies by supplying information regarding their
customers’ registered disabilities. In addition to persons with
disabilities and their repre-sentative organizations (who would be the
best source as to persons with disabilities’ specific needs), librarians
can also be a supplemental source of input to ICT developers, as they
can provide ICT developers valuable information (with user personal data
removed) from the perspective of the point of service, use or delivery
of some accessible ICTs.</p>

<p>“ICT should be seen to enable social inclusion of persons with</p>
<p>disabilities by fostering independent living.</p>
<p>A key aspect of this is, where possible, differences between the</p>
<p>technologies used at home and those used at work should be</p>

<p>time and present challenges for persons with disabilities as it

<p>Figure 11 : ict accessibility: taking respOnsibility anD cOOperating

<p>ICT accessibility is still perceived as a small market by some
private sector actors and not taken into consideration in many
governments and civil society organizations. In these cases,
accessibility departments are under-resourced and given limited
opportunity to improve accessibility of market products and services.
Further, the ICT accessibility field generally suffers from a situation
of lack of stakeholder coordination, where “the right hand does not know
what the left hand is doing”. This situation has three main causes:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Lack of awareness and training.</strong> The degree of
disconnect in awareness can be seen by</p>
<p>the limited accessibility of the products and services available in
the market, compared to relative need. Furthermore, accessibility
experts, marketing product managers and engineers who do not receive
accessibility-related training, do not have a comprehensive perspective
of needs of the different groups of persons with disabilities. In some
cases there is also the misconception that spending money on making
products accessible is not worth the investment as it restrains
innovation for products largely targeting the non-disabled market.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Lack of cooperation.</strong> Although convergence
requires the industry to work together, too</p>
<p>many accessibility actors continue to work in isolation. Software
developers and hard-ware vendors tend to not blend their expertise with
each other and use exclusive proprie-tary solutions developed in-house.
Similarly, international standards are still developed without taking
into account existing solutions or standards. Both situations are
gradu-ally being addressed through introduction of coordination
mechanisms, such as the ITU Joint-Coordinating Activity on Accessibility
and Human Factors, and examples of how cooperation is the most effective
way to take advantage of the synergies in initiatives being undertaking
by organizations.</p>
<p>3) <strong>Lack of harmonization.</strong> Accessibility does not
easily travel across borders. What</p>
<p>is applied in one country will not be suitable to be applied or
implemented in another country due to different regulations and needs.
This situation can be addressed through policy and regulation
harmonization of policies and regulation, precisely to encourage the
private sector to address the previously mentioned challenges.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the following existing approaches can be introduced

article 9 of the UNCRPD:</p>
<p>Awareness Awareness raising activities help the public and the
private raising sector understand that immediate application of the
principle</p>
<p>of universal design in product and service development will prove
cost-efficient by avoiding expensive retrofitting when future regulation
force company compliance.</p>
<p>Strengthening direct involvement of persons with disabilities in
product development would improve the understanding the needs are the
effectiveness of accessibility tests.</p>
<p>Cooperation For ensuring accessibility, conformity and
interoperabil-</p>
<p>ity, the industry could take responsibility, cooperate glob-ally and
harmonize accessibility practices through standards development.</p>
<p>International standards need to consistently include accessi-bility
features and be implemented and licensed fairly to all industry
regardless of intellectual property restrictions.</p>
<p>Standards bodies have to increase the participation of persons with
disabilities in standards meetings.</p>
<p>Harmonisation At the national level, the harmonisation of regulation
can</p>

sharing of intellectual proprietary of respective propri-etary standards

<p>“It is recognised that the right of accessibility may be in conflict
with authorial and other rights and may conflict with the commercial
duty to maximise shareholder value; and it may also be a case that in
some jurisdictions corporate social responsibility is subsidiary to
maximising shareholder value. It is therefore vital that such issues be
resolved through the rational application of economic criteria to
determine the appropri-ate level of economic investment in accessibility

afforded equal rights to influence the development of ITU-T
Recommendations. From its beginnings as a body standardizing

provided the world’s best facilities to the global standardization
community and remains the world’s only truly global ICT standards

<p>XXIV. An expert stated that a prerequisite to these training
activities was a mapping</p>
<p>(software, hardware and course) that would assess the relevance of
existing and currently used ATs as well as the required training
programs. It was also suggested that UN system could gather these tools
in a cloud computing platform. This will help telecenters and other
organizations support the training of persons with disa-bilities in an
inclusive developmental approach.</p>
<p>XXV. Advancing in the implementation of Resolution 175 (Guadalajara,
2010), and in light</p>
<p>of Article 12 of the International Telecommunications Regulations,
adopted at the 2012 World Conference on International
Telecommunications, ITU has undertaken to enable the full participation
of persons with disabilities in the activities of the Union, and to
promote the empowerment of persons with disabilities through the use of
ICTs worldwide.</p>
