DISABILITY EQUALITY INDEX - 2019


[]

About the Disability Equality Index®  

The Disability Equality Index (DEI) is the   

most comprehensive benchmarking tool for disability inclusion.  

In today’s world-class economy, all talent drives innovation, productivity, and growth. Designing workplaces that are truly inclusive and tapping into the skills and gifts of every individual, including people with disabilities, is a business imperative.

In order to achieve these goals, senior leaders across business sectors continue to advocate for organizational structures, policies and best practices that are recommended by experts and advocates in the field. This is precisely how the Disability

Equality Index was created, and why it is trusted by so many of the nation’s top corporations.

[]

In its fifth year, the Disability Equality Index continues to see an increase in year-overyear participation, with the number of top-scoring companies more than tripling to 156 in 2019 as compared to 43 in 2015, signaling a steady growth in disability inclusion across all industries.

I firmly believe that hiring people with disabilities  should be commonplace in  every workplace. As a deaf  

[]woman, I see first-hand how it makes for an inclusive culture and fosters innovation. The Disability Equality Index has been instrumental in guiding Microsoft’s disability inclusion journey and helped shape our Inclusive Hiring Program.

Jenny Lay-Flurrie

Chief Accessibility Officer, Microsoft and  Board Chair, Disability:IN             

Companies that champion disability inclusion significantly outperform their peers across key financial indices including revenue, net income, profit margins and shareholder returns*.

AAPD is truly impressed by this year’s

DEI participation and we’re proud to collaborate with the business community to prioritize industry-wide disability inclusion practices.

Since piloting the DEI in 2014, there has been a significant spike in participation and a growing need from corporations to utilize the DEI to advance disability inclusion across their businesses. Over the years, companies have asked, “What’s next?” and “Are there additional policies and practices that we should be putting in place to further the inclusion and participation of people with disabilities across the business enterprise?”

In response to these questions, the DEI Advisory Committee announced some weighted changes in May 2018 to the DEI that went into effect in calendar year 2019. 

Top-scoring DEI companies receive the recognition Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion^(™) and build brand recognition among potential and current employees, investors, and customers – including those with disabilities and their allies.
