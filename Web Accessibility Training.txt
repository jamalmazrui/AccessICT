Headings
• The most common method for finding information on a page
- 67% of WebAIM survey respondents
• Headings should describe a section of content. - Should never be empty
• Usually one <h1> per page.
• In isolation, document headings serve as a table of contents.
• Do not skip heading levels (e.g., <h2> to <h4>).
- Can skip backward (e.g., <h4> to <h2>).
