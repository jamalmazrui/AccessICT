More than 1.85 million people in Ontario and 4.4 million people in Canada have a disability. This number is on the rise as our population ages. Accessibility is no longer an option — it’s a necessity. 
 

AccessAbility 2: A Practical Handbook on Accessible Graphic Design provides practical information, insights and advice for creating more accessible design work. 
 

The current edition was released in May 2019 with a second printing in September 2021, and a third in June 2024. The first edition was released in 2010, and a more detailed edition for the web in 2015.

Produced by the RGD in Partnership with the Government of Ontario.
