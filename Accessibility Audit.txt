Human contact details;
Human contact mechanism;
Self-help option;
A fully automated contact mechanism.Semantics1.3.1: Info and RelationshipsAInformation, structure, and relationships conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text, e.g. headings, landmarks, lists, tables, footnotes etc.Semantics2.4.6: Headings and LabelsAAHeadings and labels describe topic or purpose.Semantics3.1.2: Language of PartsAAThe human language of each passage or phrase in the content can be programmatically determined except for proper names, technical terms, words of indeterminate language, and words or phrases that have become part of the vernacular of the immediately surrounding text. <p lang="es">Hola</p>Semantics3.2.4: Consistent IdentificationAAComponents that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are identified consistently.Semantics4.1.1: ParsingAIn content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.Semantics4.1.2: Name, Role, ValueAFor all user interface components (including but not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including assistive technologies.Semantics4.1.3: Status MessagesAAIn content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus. <div role="status">Hello</div>Sensory1.3.3: Sensory CharacteristicsAInstructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.Sensory1.4.1: Use of ColorAColor is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.Sensory2.3.1: Three Flashes or Below ThresholdAWeb pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds.
