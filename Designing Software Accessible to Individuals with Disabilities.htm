<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.8pt;margin-bottom:11.3pt;
margin-left:81.5pt'>By Sheryl Burgstahler, Ph.D.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.8pt;margin-bottom:14.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>People with disabilities continue to face challenges in
accessing the full range of opportunities available to people without
disabilities. Specifically, barriers to standard computer software limit
opportunities in education and employment for some people with disabilities.
For example, part of a multimedia tutorial that uses voice narration without
captioning or transcription is inaccessible to students who are deaf.
Similarly, an educational tutorial program that requires the use of a mouse is
inaccessible to a student who cannot operate this device. And, a software
program that requires an unnecessarily high reading level may be inaccessible
to some people who have learning disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.35pt;margin-bottom:
14.15pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Some individuals use specialized software and
hardware, called assistive technology, to operate software products. For
example, a person who is blind might use a screen reader program with a speech
synthesizer to access the content and functionality of a program. This system
enhancement provides access to text presented on the screen and to keyboard
commands, but does not allow the person who is blind to view graphics or to
access features that require the use of a mouse. To ensure access to all
potential users, it is important that software producers avoid creating access
barriers to people with disabilities and develop products that are compatible
with assistive technology. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.8pt;margin-bottom:14.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Designing products that can be used by people with a wide
range of abilities and disabilities is called “universal design.” In contrast,
many software producers focus on the characteristics of the “average” user. For
example, in a survey of twenty-five award winning companies who produce
pre-college instructional software, only two of the nineteen that responded
indicated they were aware of accessibility issues. Sixty-five percent of the
remaining seventeen companies were not aware of accessibility as an issue, 100%
were not currently addressing accessibility in their product development, and
88% had no plans to address accessibility in the future (Golden, 2001).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:13.0pt;margin-bottom:
1.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Clearly, much work needs to be done before software
that is accessible to people with disabilities is widely available. This
publication summarizes key legal issues, accessibility guidelines, and
resources for making software accessible to individuals with disabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.8pt;margin-bottom:14.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Congress has responded to the need to increase access to
products and services for people with disabilities by passing legislation in a
range of areas, including education, employment, transportation, assistive
technology, and electronic and information technology. Some guarantee the civil
rights of individuals with disabilities; others establish procurement
requirements for specific agencies; still others impose accessibility
requirements on producers of products and providers of services. Some legislation
is at the federal level and some is at the state level. Described below are
several relevant federal laws in the United States. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.8pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt'><b>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</b>
requires that programs and services that receive federal funding make those
options available to individuals with disabilities and provide reasonable
accommodations. In 1986, <b>Section 508</b> was added as an amendment to the <b>Rehabilitation
Act of 1973</b>. Section 508 requires that information technology, they ensure
that the electronic and information technology developed, procured, maintained,
or used by the federal government be designed to be accessible to people with
disabilities.</p>

<b>The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)</b> and its 2008
amendments is civil rights legislation that builds on and extends the reach of
Section 504. It requires that public programs and services be accessible to
people with disabilities and that they provide accessible, “effective
communication,” regardless of what medium is typically used for that
communication. For example, if a software program is used in a course at a
postsecondary institution, then the essential content that it delivers should
be made accessible to qualified students who have disabilities. The ADA also
covers issues related to nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in
employment decisions and requires that employers provide reasonable
accommodations, that may involve access to software and other electronic and
information technology. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.8pt;margin-bottom:14.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>When software is designed to be accessible to individuals
with a broad range of disabilities, it is more usable by others. For example,
providing captions to a multimedia presentation can provide access to the
content for a user who is deaf, that is using the product in a noise-free
environment, who wants to search for specific content, or for whom English is a
second language. And, making educational software available to a student who
has a learning disability that affects reading ability, can make it accessible
to younger users as well. Applying accessibility standards in the design of
software products helps level the playing field in education and employment.</p>
