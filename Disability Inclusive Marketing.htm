<h2>You are only truly customer obsessed when your customers can <b>see themselves </b>and access in the content you create.</h2>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Why?</h1>
<h2>Recent studies have shown that <b>73%</b> of people without disabilities said it was important that companies are <b>inclusive</b> of people with disabilities in their communications, advertising, and marketing. </h2>
<h2>That percentage rose to <b>83%</b> for both caregivers and <b>people with disabilities</b>*<b>. </b></h2>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; ">Why?</h1>
<h2>You’re not doing <b>good</b> marketing if you’re missing a large portion of your audience.</h2>
