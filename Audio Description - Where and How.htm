margin-left:-.25pt'>This paper, which discusses how people in the USA who are
blind or have visual impairment can find <b>audio description opportunities for
live theater, television, movies, DVDs, and streaming videos</b>, was written

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><b>Audio description</b> is a narration service for
individuals who are blind or have visual impairment.  A specially trained
individual known as an <b>audio describer</b> provides an ongoing dialogue of
visual events that are taking place on the <b>stage, screen, television, or at
other events</b>.  Audio description is <b>commentary and narration</b> that
guides the listener through the presentation with concise, objective
descriptions of scenes, settings, costumes, body language, and &quot;sight
gags,&quot; all slipped in between portions of dialogue or song. In movie
theaters and at live performances, for example, a patron using this service
wears an earpiece, so they can hear the remote describer explain the visual
events taking place, while at the same time hearing onstage or onscreen dialog,
thus providing a more robust experience while enjoying the show.  For
television and videos, the audio description is provided by listening to an
alternate audio track. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The <b>audio describer</b> is the person who writes a
script for a program such as a television series or a movie, or he or she may
be the person who “ad libs” the audio description for a live theatre
performance (though some &quot;live&quot; audio describers will do extensive
preparation and script their descriptions).  In the first case, professional
organizations are employed to have someone review the film or television show
and carefully script the description that will later be read by a professional
voice-over artist (audio narrator) and recorded for the studio that has
produced the work.  For live theater, the description could be provided by a
professional but is often provided by an amateur audio describer who has been
specially trained to do audio description on a part-time basis.  That person
previews the show several times to get familiar with it, and then delivers the
description between the spoken lines in the show for the user to appreciate the
visual aspects of the performance.  Often a second describer prepares a script
which is read ahead of the show to familiarize the patron with the stage
layout, scene changes, costumes, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>We will now address <b>how </b>you can find out about which
<b>live theatre</b> shows might be audio described, which <b>movies</b> have
description and <b>where</b> to watch them, which <b>DVDs or Blu-ray discs</b>
have audio description, which <b>online streaming services</b> offer audio
description, and how you find out about <b>television shows</b> with
description and access the description itself.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Please note:  there is <i>never</i> any charge to the
consumer to take advantage of audio description.  Organizations usually need to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Let's start now by discussing <b>live theatre</b>.  In
several dozen mostly larger cities around the United States, private
individuals or organizations offer their audio description services to local
theatre groups.  These theatre groups generally pay the describer or
organization to provide a service in which an audio describer previews a live
show several times, and then comes on a specific show date to transmit the
audio description via a microphone whose signal is received by patrons wearing
earpieces.  In the Raleigh North Carolina area, for example, that service is
provided by an organization named <b>Arts Access Incorporated</b>.  Like
similar organizations around the country, Arts Access trains audio describers
and makes the audio description service available to local theatres and also
provides the transmitter and earpieces that are necessary for patrons to hear
the audio description.  Local theaters may or may not choose to offer audio
description, and they may or may not choose to advertise which shows will have
description available in advance.   However, Arts Access, the organization
providing the service, makes this information available on their website,<a
href="https://artsaccessinc.org/"><span style='color:black;text-decoration:
none'> </span></a><a href="https://artsaccessinc.org/"><span style='color:blue'>ArtsAccessInc.org</span></a><a
href="https://artsaccessinc.org/"><span style='color:black;text-decoration:

feature audio description locally.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>So <i>how do you know</i> if there is an organization
offering audio description service in your area, or if there are any theatres
which offer audio description?  The best way is to go to a national website
called <a href="https://acb.org/adp"><b><span style='color:blue'>The Audio
Description Project</span></b></a><a href="https://acb.org/adp"><span
style='color:black;text-decoration:none'>,</span></a> which is an initiative of
the <b>ACB, the American Council of the Blind</b>. There you will find many
things of interest to people who are looking for audio description; but
specifically for this purpose, you may wish to look under the<b> Performing
Arts</b> tab to find <i>your</i> state and see if <i>your</i> city has any
theatres which offer audio description.  You can also look at the <b>AD
Services</b> tab to find out if there's an organization in your city which is
providing audio description services, and you can check with them to see what
might be available locally.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>

<h1 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.15pt;margin-bottom:0in;margin-left:
.6pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt'>TELEVISION </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Let's turn now to <b>television</b>.  In 2002 the Federal
Communications Commission ruled that major broadcast television networks and
the largest cable television networks must provide a certain number of hours of
audio described television shows each quarter in the USA.  The FCC's authority
to do this was challenged in court by various organizations, and the FCC's
mandate was struck down.  It took 8 long years for Congress to reinstate the
FCC's authority to mandate description, and nearly 2 more years to implement
it.  Currently, nine broadcast and cable networks are required to provide a
minimum of 87.5 hours of audio description for television shows per quarter. 
Curiously, audio description for television is sometimes called <b>video
description</b>, but we will use the term audio description.  (In 2020, the FCC
agreed with the ACB that the term should be changed to Audio Description.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Many <b>popular TV series</b> have audio description.  For
example:  all three NCIS series, all three Chicago series, Modern Family, The
Simpsons, some Masterpiece Theatre programs, and children’s programs on several
networks, including Saturday mornings on four networks.  Currently over 200 TV
series are audio described. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>While at the present time the law only requires description
to be provided in the top 60 broadcast markets in the United States, from a
practical point of view this service is available much more broadly.  This is
because the cable networks are required to provide the description based on the
number of customers, and they generally meet those requirements, while
satellite systems like DirecTV serve the entire United States and are also
required to provide description.  And since broadcast networks are providing
the service for some markets, they might as well pass the description out to
all local affiliates, regardless of market size.  The bottom line is:  most
people should be able to receive audio description on at least some of the
television shows in their area.  (In 2020, the FCC proposed increasing the
number of markets by 10/year.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>So this leaves two challenges:  one, finding out <b>what
shows</b> have audio description, and two, <b>how</b> to receive the
description.  Let's address the latter point first.  Audio description is
integrated into a <i>copy</i> of the regular sound track of a TV show.  The
result is an <b>alternate sound track</b>.  It is passed to the listener as an
audio signal on something conceptually called the <b>Second Audio Program</b>
channel, which is abbreviated <b>S-A-P</b> and is sometimes pronounced
&quot;sap.&quot;  It is most often referred to as the <b>S-A-P Feature</b>.  <i>Technically</i>,
now that everything is digital, the signal is no longer delivered by the S-A-P
channel, but that’s what it is still called. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'><b>To activate the SAP Feature</b>, you need to go into the
menu system of your television set or your cable box and locate the <b>Audio
menu</b>.  Under Audio, you will find an option to turn on SAP.  Sometimes the <b>remote
control</b> will have a button labeled <b>Audio</b> or <b>MTS</b> or even <b>SAP</b>,
and by pressing this button you can rotate through the two or three audio
options generally provided.  But if you must go to a menu and select the audio
functions, you may find the option you are looking for listed under <b>Languages</b>. 
There you may find that your two options are most likely English and Spanish
(or Español), depending on how the manufacturer wishes to present this.  The
option Spanish or Español is there because Spanish language is sometimes made
available via the SAP channel.  So the SAP or Secondary Audio Program audio
channel can be either Spanish-language or audio description -- or nothing.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>If you have visual impairment, you may need some sighted
assistance to figure out how you activate the SAP feature on your TV or network
cable box.  Again, it may be as simple as pressing one button to switch between
regular audio and SAP, or it may be as complicated as a half dozen or more key
presses using up and down arrows, etc., to get to the audio menu and select
either SAP or Spanish-language to turn on audio description.  Universal
controllers can often be programmed to do this using one button. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>If you turn on the SAP channel for a show which has
description, you should hear the regular soundtrack, but overlaid with a
describer's voice filling in some of the visual details of what's going on to
help you more fully enjoy the show.  If you don't hear the describer's voice,
it could mean that the show does not have description for this particular
episode or your local station or cable provider is not passing through the
description.  Once you first successfully access audio description, you will be
more comfortable in making this evaluation, because you'll know how to access
it and will have heard it at least once. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Alas, some strange things can happen.  For instance, you
may be listening to audio description, and then a commercial comes on.  The
commercial will just play normally because there is no description supplied. 
Then all of a sudden you may hear nothing.  The reason for this is that the
network has allowed the local station to insert their own advertisement at this
point, and the local station may choose not to pass regular audio on the SAP
channel when there is no description; therefore, you get no sound at all when
the local station has nothing to put on the second audio program channel.  For
this reason, it is best when a described show ends to reset the audio to the
normal mode so that anybody else using the TV will not be wondering why there
is no sound coming out at all!  (Some cable boxes, such as DirecTV’s Genie,
automatically reset when the station is changed, or a recorded program ends.) 
Another problem can occur due to a conflicting need for the use of the SAP
channel.  The FCC now mandates that emergency message scrolls at the bottom of
the screen (like weather warnings) be voiced IF the SAP channel is in use, and
this overrides the description track.  Accordingly, you may lose the entire
soundtrack for a minute or possibly much longer while the message is repeatedly
voiced.  At this point, after hearing the message, you <i>may</i> wish to
deactivate the SAP channel temporarily, so you can hear regular audio. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>We should also mention that most recent <b>video recorders</b>
(known as DVRs or TiVo boxes) will automatically record the SAP channel for
you, so you can activate it during playback.  Earlier models didn't do this,
and you had to have SAP activated during the recording process.  If yours works
that way and is provided by your cable or satellite service provider, ask for a
new unit. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Here’s something very important:  If you are using a
satellite or cable box, <b><i>don't make any changes on your television</i></b>: 
the control of the second audio program comes exclusively through the cable box
itself.  If you happen to be using what's called a Broadcast Digital Converter
Box to translate over-the-air digital signals for your old analog television,
then you will need to activate a separate feature on <i>that</i> box to
activate the SAP feature; however not all converter boxes that are available
have this capability. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Finally, we should note that in December 2016 the FCC
required that all new video equipment must offer <b>audio menus</b>.  Using
your remote, you should be able to activate speech to review information about
the current program, read the program guide, or adjust other features.  Older
cable or satellite equipment has typically been updated to include this
feature.  If your rented cable box does not support audio menus, the company <i>must</i>
provide you with a new one without additional charge, even if it would cost sighted
subscribers more. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>So, in summary, to listen to audio described TV shows, find
a show which has audio description and activate the SAP feature, the Second
Audio Program, on your television (if it is connected to an antenna) or the
cable box, even when playing back a previously recorded show. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Now let's look at <b>how you find out what shows have
description</b>.  There are several methods.  First, we list the <i>names</i>
of all described programs on our website <b>by Network</b>.  You can also
search the online listings of the various television broadcast and cable
networks.  Sometimes they have separate pages labeled audio description or
video description which list only shows with description, and we try to point
you to them.  Sometimes the regular schedule has little symbols beside certain
shows indicating that show features description.  But the best way may be to go
to a specialized listing service.  There may be more of these coming over time,
but our own Sebastian Andrade-Miles provides an updated file every week that
you can access through the Internet.  His listing includes all the stations for
which he can find this data.  (PBS is a notable exception.)  The American
Foundation for the Blind, the AFB, also provides an online service which lists
shows available specifically in your area by your local provider, or you can
use the National Federation of the Blind’s Newsline service. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Now let's turn to <b>first-run movies</b>.  Most major
studios now have audio description tracks professionally recorded for their
movies.  It used to be that if the cinema installed the necessary equipment to
offer audio description, it would only be for <i>one</i> of the screens in
multiplex theaters.  Now, with the advent of digital projection and a DOJ
(Department of Justice) ruling, essentially all the projectors have the
capability to pass along the audio description for the movie, and you should be
able to listen to description on any screen.  To access the description, ask
for an <b>audio description headset</b> when you purchase your ticket at the
box office. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>This is still an <b>evolving technology</b>, so there may
be some difficulties here and there getting reliable service.  Check with your
local theater to see whether they offer audio description.  If not, pressure
them to do so!  Many theater chains, such as Regal, also offer separate online
listings showing which movies have audio description tracks.  The website <b>captionfish.com</b>
also offers a list of local described movies; you can use their filter to
select <b>Descriptive Video</b> only.  You should also note that the conversion
to digital projection equipment (which allows the reception of description on
all screens) is an ongoing process, and older movie theaters may or may not
have invested in this new technology yet.  Legally, they had until June 2018 to
comply with the DOJ mandate.  It's a pretty safe bet that new theaters are
installing digital equipment now and the equipment to receive description,
thanks to ADA-related lawsuits that have been filed and won across the
country.  <b>AMC</b>, <b>Cinemark</b>, and <b>Regal</b> are leaders in
providing this service. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The one caution we would make here is that when you are
handed your headset, you need to make sure that they didn't misunderstand you
and are giving you an Assisted Listening Device (ALD) headset for people who
are hearing-impaired!   <i>You don't want an ALD headset</i>:  you want the <b>audio
description headset</b>.  Often the same headset (typically with two earpieces)
is used for AD and ALD with just a setting change on the receiver, but
sometimes physically different headsets are used (typically one earpiece for AD
and two earpieces for ALD).  In the latter case, once you get the right
headset, you should be able to remember for the next time when you're handed
one of the headsets whether it feels exactly the same as the one you used
before.  If not, be sure to get that straightened out <i>before</i> you go into
the theater.  In general, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>ALD headsets will amplify all sound coming from the
projected movie, while the audio description headset will only offer the
alternate soundtrack for the main feature.  So if previews start and you hear
the soundtrack in your headset, it is probably the wrong type of headset. </p>

description available, it should say so on the rear cover in the <b>Languages</b>
section, where one of the options should read <b>English Audio Description,
Descriptive Video,</b> or<b> DVS</b>.  DVS stands for Descriptive Video
Service, a registered trademark of WGBH Media Access Group, a major producer of
description for TV and movies.  The term DVS has become a bit like Kleenex or
Xerox, where one brand's trademark has become common terminology for the same
product produced by other vendors; so you may see or hear that term applied
generically.  By the way, older Warner Brothers’ DVDs are an exception to the
rule:  they indicate description is available in the lower right corner of the
rear cover.  And at the present time, on Amazon only Sony video products have a
Product Detail line showing they have “Audio Description: English”. </p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>When playing the video and you are presented with the menu
screen following the previews (which are generally not audio described), use
the main menu to go to <b>Set Up</b> or <b>Languages</b>.  In the Languages
menu, select Audio Description, and then Play.  Obviously you may need sighted
assistance to accomplish this.  The audio description will start immediately
following the standard FCC and anti-piracy messages, which usually play silently
for up to 30 seconds.  Like some of the television remote controls, you may find
an audio button on the remote control for your DVD or Blu-ray player.  By
pressing that button, the system may cycle through the various language choices
available, so you may just be able to press that once the video starts.  There
are also a few movies, typically those produced by Pixar Studios, which offer
you the chance to select audio description as soon as the disc begins playing. 
If that option is available, you will hear a chime right after the disc is
inserted.  Pressing the number 5 key, possibly followed by Enter, should
activate description. </p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>As of the start of 2018, most but not all major movie
studios are offering audio description language tracks on many of their
videos.  The “Good Guy” list currently includes the original three, Sony,
Universal, and the Disney companies, plus Fox, Paramount, Warner Brothers, and
a limited number from Lionsgate. </p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>So how do you find out <b>which videos have audio
description tracks</b>?  Again, the Audio Description Project offers this
information, and we are the <i>only</i> complete supplier of this information. 
If you go to the audio description project website, <a
href="http://www.acb.org/adp"><b><span style='color:blue'>www.acb.org/adp</span></b></a><a
href="http://www.acb.org/adp"><span style='color:black;text-decoration:none'> </span></a>,
and click on the <b>DVDs All</b> tab, you will find a master list of <i>all</i>
the videos which have been released with audio description tracks since 1997. 
Some of the older ones may or may not be described on rental versions, but
essentially all are today.  New DVDs and Blu-ray discs with audio description
tracks are announced each week on the main page of the Audio Description
Project website, and you can subscribe there to updates, or you can get weekly
updates from the project's <b>Facebook</b> page or <b>Twitter</b> feed.  Look
for “Audio Description Project” on Facebook or Twitter. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>By the way, another possible source for described videos is
your <b>State Library for the Blind</b>.  Sometimes they record their own
description tracks, but more often these days they will have the commercial
versions with description available for loan to qualified subscribers.   </p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>Our final topic is <b>video streaming services</b>.  There
is a lot of competition today for mostly feebased delivery of video on your
internet-connected TV or portable media devices like iPads.  Some of those
services offer audio description for their programming, while others are under
pressure to do so.  As of May 2020, the following services offer a significant
number of audio described movies and other programming:  Amazon’s <b>Prime
Video</b> (over 1800 titles); <b>Apple TV+</b> (started November 2019, 25
titles); <b>Disney+</b> (over 500 titles); <b>Hulu</b> (started early 2019, 80+
titles); <b>Netflix</b> (over 1200 titles), Apple’s <b>iTunes</b> (over 1200
titles), plus the free <b>Watch ABC App</b> for ABC network programming and the
fee-based <b>CBS All Access</b> which just recently began offering described
programs.  Even an adult video site offers description for a subset of its
videos!  In May 2020, <b>Spectrum Access</b> became available, replacing
Actiview, with over 300 AD tracks for movies that you can download for free and
use along with video from a DVD or streaming service for private listening.  In
Spring 2020, <b>HBO Max</b> and <b>NBC Peacock</b> will come online, and we
hope they will both include audio description, but we don’t know.  We offer <b>alphabetized
listings of described titles from all the streaming services mentioned</b>, and
we have a separate page devoted to general information about Streaming
Services.  Check our Streaming page for updates. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>And please note that perhaps our most important offering is
our <b>Master AD List</b>, which includes every audio described video currently
available at the cinema (as first-run movies), on DVD and Blu-ray disc (since
1997), on the nine mandated TV networks, or on the streaming services – a
number exceeding 4000 video offerings with description. </p>

margin-bottom:.0001pt'>CONCLUSION </h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'>  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>So there you have it.  Audio description is available at no
extra charge at selected live theatre performances, in most movie theaters, on
television, on select purchased or rental DVDs and Blu-ray discs, and on many
mainline streaming video services.  <i>You</i> need to take the initiative to
find out what is available locally or online, then take advantage of it! </p>
