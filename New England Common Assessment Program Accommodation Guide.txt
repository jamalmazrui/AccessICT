Foreword 
 
This NECAP Accommodations Guide is an update of the previous version published back in August 2010.  This document is intended to supplement test administration information contained in the NECAP Principal Test Coordinator Manual and grade-specific Test Administrator Manual produced for each administration of the NECAP Science tests.  This document is a joint product of the NECAP states and is the result of input and the efforts of personnel from each of the NECAP states, the Center for Assessment (NCIEA), and Measured Progress. 
 
 
The primary purpose for updating this Guide is to remove references to accommodations that are not applicable to the NECAP Science assessments.  The secondary purpose is to update state contact information.  
 
 

Section 1: Purpose of the Accommodations Guide 
 
This guide is supplementary to the Principal/Test Coordinator Manual and the Test Administrator Manuals.  It is to be used in conjunction with these manuals.  The Manuals include overall administration information for all students.  The Manuals explain such things as extending the testing time and reading the test aloud to students. 
 
It is important to remember that this guide also contains information that is relevant for all students.  On the NECAP Science test, standard test accommodations are allowable for all students.  In order to make sure that all students are given access to test accommodations that they may need during state testing, it is vital for test administrators to become familiar with allowable accommodations and the appropriate ways to administer them. 
 
The NECAP Accommodations Guide has been created to... 
 
• ensure a standardized accommodation administration process is followed. 
• help schools make appropriate accommodation choices for students and understand what, if any, consequences are attached to their decisions. 
• help schools provide students with the best opportunity to show what they know within the state testing environment. 
• help building administrators and test coordinators train school personnel involved in the administration of accommodations. 
 
REMINDER 
Testing accommodations should be made for individual students; they are not designed for use with entire classrooms.  They should not give students unfair advantages.  Rather they are meant to remove barriers that may exist due to a student's learning style or disability.  Students should have had experience using an accommodation during routine instruction and/or test-taking, as appropriate, in the classroom prior to its use on a NECAP Science test. 
 

Section 2: Introduction to NECAP Accommodations 
 
All students are eligible to utilize appropriate assessment accommodations listed in the Table of Standard Test Accommodations when participating in the NECAP tests.  Any accommodation(s) utilized for the assessment of individual students must be: 
 
• the result of a decision made by the IEP, Section 504, or other school team that includes, whenever possible, the student's parent(s) or guardian(s).  Under most circumstances accommodation decisions should be made prior to testing.  There always will be emergencies and unforeseen cases that require an accommodation decision to be made during the test administration window.  These cases should be rare and should not preclude the accommodation decision being made by an appropriate school team. 
• based on the individual student's needs. 
• consistent with those accommodations used during the student's regular classroom instruction, including testtaking and, if applicable, consistent with the student's IEP or 504 Plan. 
• documented at the appropriate local level. 
 
Test accommodations are changes in setting, timing (including scheduling), presentation format, or response format that do not alter in any significant way what the test measures or the comparability of results.  When used properly, appropriate test accommodations remove barriers to participation in the assessment and provide students with diverse learning needs an equitable opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and skills. 
 
Most students who need accommodations can be supported successfully by using one or more of the standard accommodations listed in the timing (T), setting (S), presentation (P), and response (R) categories on the NECAP Table of Standard Test Accommodations.   
 
The accommodations included in the Table of Standard Test Accommodations are based on research, best practice, and educators' experiences administering the NECAP tests over several years.  However, the Table of Standard Test Accommodations is not an exhaustive list of allowable accommodations.  Individual students may have particular needs that require the use of an accommodation not included in the Table of Standard Test Accommodations.  In such cases, school personnel may contact the Department/Agency of Education to request verification of the comparability of a proposed accommodation using the procedures described under Other Accommodations on pages 20-21. 

Section 3: Making Accommodation Decisions 
 
Decisions about the use of accommodations should not be made by an individual.  Decisions should be made by the school team responsible for planning the student's academic program and should include parent participation.  It is recommended that every school identify a process to determine how accommodation decisions are made for students who do not have IEPs or 504 plans.  Many schools already have Student Support or Child Study Teams in place for the purpose of addressing the individual needs of students in general education. 
 
The role of the team is to discuss the accommodations that a student may need for NECAP testing, decide which accommodations will be used by the student, and document the process. 
 
These teams would typically involve the following individuals: 
 
For students in general education: 
• Educators involved in supporting the student 
• Parent(s) and/or guardian(s)  Student (as appropriate) 
 
For students with 504 Plans, the student's existing 504 Team, including: 
• Educators involved in supporting the student 
• Parent(s) and/or guardian(s)  Student (as appropriate) 
 
For students with disabilities, the student's existing IEP Team, including:  
• Special and general educators involved in supporting the student 
• Parent(s) and/or guardian(s) 
• Student (as appropriate) 
 
For students who are English language learners (ELL): 
• Teachers of English language learners or bilingual students and general educators involved in supporting the student 
• Interpreter (as appropriate) 
• Parent(s) and/or guardian(s) 
• Student (as appropriate) 
 
Assessment Supports that are not Accommodations 
 
When making decisions about accommodation use for an individual student, the team should be aware of the many assessment supports allowable for all students during NECAP testing that are not considered accommodations.  Although these supports are not considered accommodations and their use does not need to be recorded on the Student 
Answer Booklet, thoughtful planning and preparation for the student's test-taking experience should include consideration of these available supports including how and when they can be used appropriately.  General test supports include the basic minimum conditions that should be provided to create an appropriate testing environment.  Some limited individualization is permitted within these general supports.  .   
 
The following are examples of assessment supports that are not accommodations: 
 
Before Testing, the Test Administrator: 
• Reviews and shares "Test Taking Tips for Teachers to Share with Students" 
• Provides students with a "NECAP Practice Test" experience that is appropriate to their tested grade level (if school personnel believe this will help the students to become familiar with the test format and test taking procedures), or to give students a chance to practice good test taking strategies as suggested in the 'Tips' documents. 
• Encourages and reminds students to get a good night's rest and a healthful breakfast prior to test administration to help them focus and give their best effort. 
• Is familiar with (and to) the students who are being tested   
• Schedules group test sessions during the normal school day with distractions minimized 
 
During Testing, the Test Administrator: 
• Provides a quiet, appropriate group testing space equipped with testing materials students will need. Note:  A list of standard NECAP test materials (including required reference sheets and tools) is provided in the grade appropriate Test Administrator Manual.  
• As needed provides appropriate furniture and placement, including as appropriate, preferential seating for certain students, or assigns all student seating.  Study carrels may be assigned to minimize testing distractions, if needed. 
• As needed provides motor and balance supports,  Special individualized pencil grips, positioning or balance equipment, wheelchairs, walkers, or occupational or physical therapy supports that permit motor movement enabling a student to interact with the test are allowed and are not treated as a test accommodation - provided that they do not provide any academic function for the student.   
o 	Note:  In general, assistive communication technology devices ARE treated as accommodation supports.  For more information, refer to the NECAP Table of Standard Test Accommodations or contact the Department/Agency of Education.   
• Allows individually prescribed corrective lenses, glasses, or hearing aids without accommodation.  For other special purpose auditory or visual supports & aids, see NECAP Table of Standard Test Accommodations. 
1. Provides the scripted general test directions (from the test administrator's manual) to all students,  o 	During the Introduction to the Session, Test Administrators may: 
A. repeat scripted directions for students as needed, and may check for understanding of scripted test directions before proceeding, 
B. clarify only the scripted directions (general procedures) that are read to the entire class, and  
 
 
During Testing, Test Administrators may:  
• Answer questions about the very few test navigation directions found inside the test booklet (such as: 'Mark your answer to number 15 on page 4'; 'Go on to the next page'; or 'Stop'.) 
• Provide active, 'walk-around' proctoring during testing, to ensure that students remain productively on task and focused 
• May, upon student request, pronounce single words  o 	students may ask the test administrator to pronounce single words they do not recognize.  Test administrators may also pronounce single written words in English   
o 	Note: Test administrators should not read entire sentences as a general support.  This level of support should be treated as an accommodation.  Support that involves reading entire sentences to the student must be determined and planned by the educational team before testing, consistent with routine practice, and documented appropriately as either an accommodation or a modification, depending upon tested content area.  
 
 
 
During Testing, a Student may - 
2. Circle, underline, or mark text in the Student Test Booklet that he or she finds to be important to him or her during the test.  This is a test taking strategy and not an accommodation if the student is doing this independently (highlighters may not be used at grades 3 and 4 because they may bleed through, pencils may be used at these grades) 
3. Use post-it notes to flag test session stop signs they must not go beyond or may use a plain (non-ruler) straight edge (e.g., scrap paper) to assist with visual tracking while they read.   
o 	Note:  It is very important that any post-it notes or similar inserted material be removed before the booklet is returned for scoring. 
• Select and use NECAP permitted calculation supports as consistent with local school policy.  For more information on the use of calculation aides or tools permitted during testing, see:  NECAP Calculator Policy available on your state's NECAP website. 
 
After Testing, a Test Administrator may - 
• Permit or provide appropriate reading or other quiet activity material for those students who finish early while others are still working.  This must be planned before testing. 
 	 
 General Note: Many supports that exceed the limits of the procedures described above are considered to be formal accommodations and are included in the NECAP Table of Standard Accommodations.  However, if a procedure provides so much support that it prevents the student from demonstrating the construct being tested, then it changes the very academic content the test is attempting to measure, and for this reason it will be treated as a modification.  It is very important to understand the difference between accommodations and modifications.  Please read this manual completely and, if you need more information, contact your state education assessment office. 
 
Additional information on allowable assessment supports and general test information is available in the following documents posted on the Department/Agency of Education Website: 
 
• Tips for Teachers to Share with Students 
• NECAP Practice Tests, Posted by content area and grade level 
• NECAP Calculator Policy 
• NECAP Released Items and Teacher Support Materials 
 
The Appropriate Use of an Accommodation: Finding the Balance 
 
There is an important distinction between instructional accommodations and testing accommodations.  Supports provided at the beginning of the instructional process are designed to help students' first experience, learn, and practice a new skill. The long term purpose of instructional accommodations or other early supports is to ultimately help the student learn to become as fluent and as independent as possible in performing that skill.  For this reason, instructional accommodations should incorporate a scaffolded fading process that provides much more support early in the learning process as skill acquisition is just beginning.   Later in the instructional process the need for early levels of support should be challenged or tested to see how much control can be assumed by the student.  The intensive supports used very early in instruction may at times greatly simplify or may even modify the skill the student is learning helping to guide, shape, and successively approximate the student's behavior to ensure that he or she experiences some early success while moving closer to real skill performance.   When planning instructional supports, the path to student independence must always be kept in mind.   Plan with the end in mind, always move toward independence. 
 
As effective instruction continues, early intensive supports (or modifications) are faded, allowing the student to demonstrate the academic skill with increasing independence. As higher levels of skill independence are achieved, supports are faded back further still until the least intrusive accommodation or, perhaps even full independence is achieved.   The least intrusive accommodation is the level of support that will allow the student to demonstrate the skill in the most independent manner possible for that student.    
 
For example, if a student has a certain type of visual processing difficulty, he or she may need (for some years) to use a straight edge to guide visual tracking while reading, but eventually learns to perform the actual reading task with full independence to the extent of his or her capability.  At the point of testing, this student no longer has a person holding the tracking tool or reading the test to him or her.  This has become the independent responsibility of the student; yet remaining student needs for support are still being met.  Independent use of the visual tracking tool has become the least intrusive accommodation for the student at this point. 
 
 
 
Testing accommodations should be those accommodations that are the least intrusive accommodations possible to meet the needs of the student while allowing the maximum level of independence possible for that student.   They represent the current balance point the instructional fading process has achieved.  Testing accommodations, therefore, represent the highest point of independent skill acquisition that has been achieved with that student to date through the instructional process.  Testing accommodations do not necessarily represent the instructional end point, but they do represent a point in time that lies beyond the earliest phases of skill acquisition.   Some skill independence should be seen if instruction has been effective.  Teams must remember to carefully consider long term independence and thoughtfully design the process of fading supports when choosing and planning instructional methods.    
 
The key is finding the right balance of supports for a given student and actively, consistently, and constructively supporting the growth of student independence.  

Section 4: Standard Test Accommodations 
 
This section of the Accommodations Guide contains a copy of the NECAP Table of Standard Test Accommodations and a discussion of each of the six categories of accommodations in the table:  Timing (T), Setting (S), Presentation (P), Response (R), Other Accommodations (O), and Modifications (M).  For each category, there is a list of the standard accommodations, an overview of the category, explanations of the use of selected accommodations as needed, and examples and procedures to be followed as needed. 
 
The Table of Standard Test Accommodations is a list of accommodations that are available to all students on an individual basis, regardless of disability status.  Following procedures previously outlined in Section 3 (Making Accommodation Decisions), school teams will refer to the Tables of Standard Test Accommodations when making decisions for NECAP testing. 
 
All accommodations must be recorded by the test administrator on the Student Answer Booklet.  Please be sure to bubble in only those accommodations that the student actually used for the NECAP test for each content area in which they were used.  
 
It is important to note that if the team believes a student needs an accommodation that is not listed, the school 
must contact appropriate personnel at the Department/Agency of Education to discuss the proposed accommodation (see contact information on page ii).  The approval process and any consequences that result from the use of that accommodation will be discussed. 

NECAP Table of Standard Accommodations 
Revised March 2016 
 
Any accommodation(s) used for the assessment of an individual student will be the result of a team decision made at the local level. All decisions regarding the use of accommodations must be made on an individual student basis - not for a large group, entire class, or grade level. Accommodations are available to all students on the basis of individual need regardless of disability status and should be consistent with the student's normal routine during instruction and assessment. This table is not intended to be used as a stand-alone document and should always be used in conjunction with the NECAP Accommodations Guide. 
 
T. Timing Code Tests were administered Details on Delivery of Accommodations T1 with time to complete a session extended beyond the scheduled administration time within the same day. NECAP tests are not designed to be timed or speeded tests. The scheduled administration time already includes additional time and the vast majority of students complete the test session within that time period. Extended time within a single sitting may be needed by students who are unable to meet time constraints. A test session may be extended until the student can no longer sustain the activity.  T2 so that only a portion of the test session was administered on a particular day. In rare and severe cases, the extended time accommodation (T1) may not be adequate for a student not able to complete a test session within a single day. A test session may be administered to a student as two or more "mini-sessions" if procedures are followed to maintain test security and ensure that the student only has access to the items administered on that day (see the NECAP Accommodations Guide for details). T3 with short, supervised breaks. Multiple or frequent breaks may be required by a student whose attention span, distractibility, or physical condition, requires shorter working periods. T4 at the time of day or day of week that takes into account the student's medical needs or learning style. Individual scheduling may be used for a student whose school performance is noticeably affected by the time of day or day of the school week on which it is done. This accommodation may not be used specifically to change the order of administration of test sessions. This accommodation must not result in the administration of a test session to an individual student prior to the regularly scheduled administration time for that session for all students.  
S. Setting Code Tests were administered Details on Delivery of Accommodations S1 in a separate location within the school by trained school personnel. A student or students may be tested individually or in small groups in an alternative site within the school to reduce distractions for themselves or others, or to increase physical access to special equipment.  S2 in an out-of-school setting by trained school personnel. Out-of-school testing may be used for a student who is hospitalized or tutored because they are unable to attend school. The test must be administered by trained school personnel familiar with test administration procedures and guidelines. Relatives/guardians of the student may not be used as the test administrator.  
P. Presentation Code Tests were administered Details on Delivery of Accommodations P1 individually. Individual or small group testing may be used to minimize distractions for a student or students whose test is administered out of the classroom or so that others will not be distracted by other accommodations being used (e.g., dictation) P2 in a small group. P3 with test and directions read aloud in English or signed to the student.  A reader may be used for a student whose inability to read would hinder performance on the Science test. Words must be read as written. No translations (with the exception of signed language) or explanations are allowed. Trained personnel may use sign language to administer the test. P4 with only test directions read aloud or signed to the student. A reader may be used for a student whose inability to read or locate directions would hinder performance on the test. Note that most directions on the NECAP test occur at the beginning of the test session and are already read aloud by the test administrator. Guidelines for what are and are not "test directions" must be followed. With the exception of sign language and the case of students enrolled in a program where the test administrator routinely presents information in a foreign language, directions may not be translated. P5 with administrator verification of student understanding following the reading of test directions. After test directions have been read, the test administrator may ask the student to explain what he/she has been asked to do. If directions have been misunderstood by the student, the test directions may be paraphrased or demonstrated. Test items MUST NOT be paraphrased or explained. P6 using alternative or assistive technology that is part of the student's communication system. The test may be presented through his/her regular communication system to a student who uses alternative or assistive technology on a daily basis.  P7 by trained school personnel known to the student other than the student's classroom teacher. A student may be more comfortable with a test administrator who works with the student on a regular basis, but is not the student's regular teacher for the general curriculum or other staff assigned as test administrator. All test administrators must be trained school personnel familiar with test administration and accommodations procedures and guidelines. P8 using a large-print version of assessment. Both large-print and Braille versions of the assessment require special preparation and processing and must be pre-ordered. Directions for ordering these materials are included in communications sent to school principals prior to the test. P9 using Braille version of assessment. P10 using a word-to-word translation dictionary for ELL students.  A student with limited English proficiency may have a word-toword dictionary available for individual use as needed. A wordto-word dictionary is one that does not include any definitions. Information on acceptable dictionaries is provided on the department/agencies' websites. P11 using visual or auditory supports. The test may be presented using visual aids such as visual magnification devices, reduction of visual print by blocking or other techniques, or acetate shields; or auditory devices such as special acoustics, amplification, noise buffers, whisper phones, or calming music.  
 
R. Response Code Tests were administered Details on Delivery of Accommodations R1 with a student dictating responses to school personnel.  A student may dictate answers to constructed-response or shortanswer questions to locally trained personnel or record oral answers in an individual setting so that other students will not benefit by hearing answers or be otherwise disturbed. Policies regarding recorded answers must be followed prior to returning test materials. R2 with a student dictating responses using alternative or assistive technology/devices that are part of the student's communication system.  Technology is used to permit a student to respond to the test. When using a computer, word processing device, or other assistive technology, spell and grammar checks must be turned off. Policies regarding recorded answers must be followed prior to returning test materials. R3 with a student using approved tools or devices to minimize distractions. Noise buffers, place markers, carrels, etc. may be used to minimize distractions for the student. This accommodation does NOT include assistive devices such as templates, graphic organizers, or other devices intended specifically to help students organize thinking or develop a strategy for a specific question. R4 with a student writing responses using separate paper, a word processer, computer, brailler, or similar device. A student may use technological or other tools (e.g., large-spaced paper) to write responses to constructed-response, short-answer, and extended response items. A key distinction between this accommodation and R2 is that the student using this accommodation is responding in writing rather than dictating. When using a computer, word processing device, or other assistive technology, spell and grammar checks must be turned off, as well as access to the Web. This accommodation is intended for unique individual needs, not an entire class. Policies regarding recorded answers must be followed prior to returning test materials.  R5 with a student indicating responses to multiple-choice items to school personnel. A student unable to write or otherwise unable to fill-in answers to multiple-choice questions may indicate a response to trained school personnel. The school personnel records the student's response in the student answer booklet. R6 with a student responding with the use of visual aids. Visual aids include any optical or non-optical devices used to enhance visual capability. Examples include magnifiers, special lighting, markers, filters, large-spaced paper, color overlays, etc. An abacus may also be used for student with severe visual impairment or blindness on the Science test. Note that the use of this accommodation still requires student responses to be recorded in a student answer booklet. R7 with a student with limited English proficiency responding with use of a word-to-word dictionary.  A student with limited English proficiency may have a word-toword dictionary available for individual use as needed when responding. A word-to-word dictionary is one that does not include any definitions. Information on acceptable dictionaries is provided on each Department/Agency's website.  
 
O. Other 
These accommodations require DOE approval. Code Tests were administered Details on Delivery of Accommodations O1 using other accommodation(s) not on 
this list, requested by the accommodations team.  An IEP team or other appropriate accommodation team may request that a student be provided an accommodation not included on this standard list of accommodations. Like all other accommodations, these should be consistent with the student's normal routine during instruction and/or assessment. Requests should be made to the AOE/DOE when accommodation plans are being made for a student prior to testing. AOE/DOE approval must be received for the requested accommodation to be coded as an O1 accommodation. Non-approved accommodations used during test administration will be coded as an M3 modification.  
M. Modifications 
All modifications result in impacted items being scored as incorrect. Code Tests were administered Details on Delivery of Accommodations M1 using a graphing calculator on Session 3 of the Science test Inappropriate use of a calculator or other tools will result in impacted items being scored as incorrect. M3 using an accommodation on this list not approved for a particular test or an accommodation not included on this 
list without prior approval of the 
AOE/DOE. Inappropriate use of an accommodation included on this list or use of another accommodation without prior approval of the AOE/DOE will result in impacted items being scored as incorrect.  
Note: English Language Learners may qualify for any of the accommodations listed as appropriate and determined by a team. Refer to the NECAP Accommodations Guide for additional information. 
 
 
 
Timing (T) 
 
T1. With time to complete a session extended beyond the scheduled administration time within the same day. T2. So that only a portion of the test session was administered on a particular day T3. With short, supervised breaks 
T4. At the time of day that takes into account the student's medical needs or learning style. 
 
 
Considerations for Timing accommodations 
 
Overall: 
• Students must be supervised at all times during an active testing session, including breaks. 
• Timing accommodations may not be used specifically to change the required order of administration of NECAP tests or test sessions. 
 
 
T1 With time to complete a session extended beyond the scheduled administration time within the same day. 
 
• All students are given additional time on the NECAP tests.  The guidelines in the Principal/Test Coordinator and Test Administrator Manuals indicate the amount of time that must be scheduled for each test session.  The scheduled time has been calculated to provide students significant additional time to complete the test session beyond the time that the vast majority of students will require to complete the test session.  Completing the test within the scheduled time for the test session should not be marked as an accommodation. 
• The extended time accommodation should be used for students who routinely take more than double the allotted time to complete class projects and tests.  For other students, the decision to use this accommodation should include consideration of the amount of additional time built into the scheduled time for the test session as well as the student's normal timing requirements. The decision to use this accommodation may also require the use of an alternative setting accommodation. 
• Refer to the Principal/Test Coordinator Manual for a complete discussion of the amount of additional time that has been built into the required time to be scheduled for a particular test and test session.  The percentage of additional time built into the schedule varies for the Inquiry Task portion of the Science Test (session 3). 
 
 
T2 So that only a portion of the test session was administered on a particular day 
 
• The use of this accommodation should be very rare and limited to severe cases in which even with the use of other accommodations such as extended time (T1) and short, supervised breaks (T3), a student would be unable to complete a test session within a single day.  Use of this accommodation requires the test administrator to ensure that the student only has access to the set of test items that will be completed on a particular day in order to maintain test security.  It is likely that use of this accommodation will also require an individual administration (P1) in which a test administrator can closely monitor the student.  Prior to use of this accommodation schools should contact the Department/Agency of Education to discuss appropriate strategies for its use on a particular test or test session. 
• This accommodation is NOT intended for students who begin a test session and are unable to complete it because they become ill or must be removed from the testing environment for some other reason.   
 
 
T3 With short, supervised breaks 
 
• Be sure students who need frequent breaks (T3) are supervised during these breaks.  They should not be allowed opportunities to interact with other students.  Recess and lunch may not be used as breaks during a single testing session.  Sessions must be completed within the length of the day. 
Setting (S) 
 
S1. In a separate location within the school by trained school personnel S2. In an out-of-school setting by trained school personnel 
 
 
Considerations for Setting accommodations 
 
Overall: 
• Make sure the alternative setting is conducive to test-taking, and that the setting is quiet, has minimal distractions, and is reserved for a sufficient block of time. 
• The decision to administer the test in an alternative setting is often linked to the need to properly administer other accommodations.  Therefore, the setting accommodations are often bundled with other accommodations.  Make sure the setting matches the intent of the other accommodation.  For example, 
- an individual student who needs to have sections of the test read aloud (P3) should be in a location that will not disturb other students.   
- it may not be possible to test a student who needs short, supervised breaks (T3) as an accommodation during testing in a small group. 
• All tests must be administered by trained school personnel. 
 
S2 In an out-of-school setting by trained school personnel 
 
• The use of a non-school setting is intended for unique situations, such as a student who is incarcerated or a student with a long-term illness receiving instruction at home.  This accommodation is not intended for students who are home-schooled. 
 
 
REMINDER 
Test security must be maintained in all alternative settings.  The administrator must secure all test materials during transfer to and from the alternative setting.  If the student is being tested in a separate location within the school, do not send the student to the alternative setting or back to the classroom on his/her own with testing materials.

Considerations for Presentation accommodations 
 
Overall: 
• Many presentation accommodations need to be bundled with an alternative setting (S1) accommodation.  Make sure to take this into consideration when planning needed accommodations for a student, and when determining the number of individual (P1) and small group (P2) accommodations that may be needed. 
 
P2 In a small group 
 
• The size of a small group of students will vary depending on the other accommodations that are bundled with it.  
• Students who need the test and directions read aloud (P3) should probably be limited to a group size of no more than five. Students will need to work the problems out at their own individual pace.  The test administrator will need to read a test item when the student is ready to work on that item. 
• Students who have been identified in advance as needing an extended time accommodation (T1) may be able to have the test administered in a group larger than five students because students are working at their own pace. 
 
P3 With test and directions read aloud in English or signed to the student.  
 
• Note that portions of the Science Inquiry Task (session 3) are designed to be read aloud to all students.  
Reading aloud these portions of the test should not be marked as an accommodation. 
• This accommodation should be administered in a manner that provides the amount of support required by the student and in a manner most similar to routine classroom instruction and test-taking for the student.  For example, 
- The test administrator may read the entire test in allowed content areas and sessions to the student, - 	The student may ask for only portions of the test to be read aloud by the test administrator, as needed. 
 
P4 With only test directions read aloud or signed to the student. 
 
• Scripted test directions contained in the Test Administrator Manuals are read aloud by test administrators to all students being tested.  These scripted directions may be repeated for any student as a standard procedure.  Reading theses scripted test directions should not be marked as an accommodation. 
• On NECAP Science tests, test directions inside test booklets are very limited and are generally printed in bold in a page header, a page footer, or above a test item number.  These directions may be repeated as often as needed.  Examples of these directions include  - 	the session header or footer "Science - Session 1" 
- "Answer questions 1 through 13 on page 12 in your Student Answer Booklet" 
- navigation directions such as "Go on." or "Do not go on. Stop." 
- general notes such as "No test materials on this page." 
• Test directions DO NOT include test items or response options, which may not be read aloud under accommodation P4. 
• With the exception of sign language and the case of students enrolled in a program where the test administrator routinely presents information in a foreign language, test directions may not be translated. 
 
 
P5 With administrator verification of student understanding following the reading of test directions 
 
• Test administrators are expected to ask all students in a class whether they understand scripted test directions that are read by test administrator.  That practice should not be marked as an accommodation and is not the intent of accommodation P5. 
• This accommodation should be used with students who routinely have trouble interpreting and following directions during normal classroom instruction and test-taking situations. 
 
P8 Using a large-print version of assessment 
 
• Prior to each test administration the Department/Agency of Education provides schools with information needed to order large-print tests for the upcoming administration. 
• Make sure to consider whether the student uses large-print materials routinely for classroom instruction and test-taking.  The NECAP tests should not be the first time the student is introduced to large-print materials. 
• If the use of large-print materials results in the student responding outside of the Student Answer Booklet (for example R4), policies regarding recorded answers must be followed prior to returning test materials. 
 
P9 Using Braille version of assessment 
 
• Prior to each test administration the Department/Agency of Education provides schools with information needed to order Braille tests for the upcoming administration. 
• Make sure to consider whether the student is using Braille routinely for classroom instruction and test-taking.  The NECAP tests are translated into both contracted and uncontracted Braille.  Uncontracted Braille is usually used by younger or beginning Braille readers.  The school personnel ordering Braille test(s) will need to know what type of Braille the student is accustomed to using. 
• Use of Braille tests is likely to be bundled with a response accommodation such as R4.  Policies regarding recorded answers must be followed prior to returning test materials. 
 
P10 Using a word-to-word translation dictionary for ELL students  
 
• This accommodation is most appropriate for intermediate-stage English language learners.  Research has shown that this accommodation is not helpful for beginning-stage learners. 
• Make sure to consider whether the student uses a word-to-word translation dictionary routinely during classroom instruction and test-taking. 
• A word-to-word translation dictionary does not include any definitions. Additional information on appropriate word-to-word translation dictionaries can be found in Section 6: Accommodation Resources. 
• It is likely that this accommodation will be bundled with the corresponding response accommodation R7. 
 
P11 Using visual or auditory supports 
 
• This accommodation includes a variety of visual and auditory supports designed to minimize distractions and help students focus during the test administration. 
• Materials that block other print on the page of the Test Booklet or Student Answer Booklet must not permanently alter the booklet. The use of Post-it Notes or plain paper, for example, is acceptable. 
 
 
Response (R) 
 
 
R1. With a student dictating responses to school personnel  
R2. With a student dictating responses using alternative or assistive technology/devices that are part of the student's communication system  
R3. With a student using approved tools or devices to minimize distractions 
R4. With a student writing responses using separate paper, a word processer, computer, Brailler, or similar device 
R5. With a student indicating responses to multiple-choice items to school personnel 
R6. With a student responding with the use of visual aids 
R7. With a student with limited English proficiency responding with use of a word-to-word dictionary  
 
Considerations for Response accommodations  
 
Overall: 
• Note that response accommodations R1, R2, and R4 may result in the student responding outside of the Student Answer Booklet.  Policies regarding recorded answers must be followed prior to returning test materials.  Separate sheets of paper stapled, taped, or glued into the Student Answer Booklet are not acceptable. 
• Students responding outside of the Student Answer Booklet should be shown the provided answer space in the Student Answer Booklet prior to responding, in order for them to gauge how much to write. 
 
R1 With a student dictating responses to school personnel. 
 
• When using this accommodation, the student is dictating his/her responses to the constructed response questions directly to trained school personnel or recording oral responses.  In most cases, school personnel will be able to scribe student responses directly into the Student Answer Booklet at the same time as the student is responding. 
• Responses must be scribed exactly as dictated. 
• In the event that responses are not scribed in the Student Answer Booklet at the same time as they are produced, policies regarding recorded answers must be followed prior to returning test materials. 
• This response accommodation should require an individual administration (P1) and may also require the use of an alternative setting (S1) and possible the use of extended time (T1). 
 
R5 With a student indicating responses to multiple-choice items to school personnel 
 
• When using this accommodation, the student is indicating by pointing to or naming/reading aloud his/her answers to multiple-choice questions, and at the same time school personnel is marking those answers in the Student Answer Booklet. 
• This response accommodation should require an individual administration (P1) and may also require the use of an alternative setting (S1) and possible the use of extended time (T1). 
 
R6 With a student responding with the use of visual aids 
 
• An abacus can be used by a student with severe visual impairment or blindness in any of the Science sessions. 
 
R7 With a student with limited English proficiency responding with use of a word-to-word dictionary  
 
• This accommodation is most appropriate for intermediate-stage English language learners.  Research has shown that this accommodation is not helpful for beginning-stage learners. 
• Make sure to consider whether the student uses a word-to-word translation dictionary routinely during classroom instruction and test-taking. 
• A word-to-word translation dictionary does not include any definitions. Additional information on appropriate word-to-word translation dictionaries can be found in Section 6: Accommodation Resources. 
• It is likely that this accommodation will be bundled with the corresponding presentation accommodation P10. 
 
 
 
Other Accommodations (O) and Modifications (M) 
 
The school must contact the Agency or Department of Education to request approval for any accommodation not listed as a standard accommodation under the categories for Timing (T), Setting (S), Presentation (P), and Response (R) (see contact information on page ii).  The approval process and any consequences that result from the use of the proposed accommodation will be discussed.  Based on the information provided by school personnel, the Agency or Department of Education will determine if the proposed accommodation will preserve the comparability of the test items to which it is being applied.  The Agency or Department of Education will not override IEP Team decisions regarding the use of an accommodation during testing.  However, if the school decides to use an accommodation that was determined to be noncomparable, then the proposed accommodation will be treated as a modification.  All impacted items using modifications are counted as incorrect. 
 
Other Accommodations (O1) 
 
 
O1. Using other accommodation(s) not on this list, requested by the accommodations team.  
 
 
Considerations for Other Accommodations 
 
Overall: 
• Use the "Other Accommodation" Discussion Worksheet in Appendix B to gather the information needed for a discussion with state personnel on accommodations. 
• Contact state personnel about the accommodation being proposed.  State personnel will determine whether the accommodation is comparable or not.   
• Proposed accommodations that are verified as comparable by state personnel will need to be recorded as O1 on the Student Answer Booklet.   
• If the proposed accommodation is deemed not comparable, then it is classified as a modification (see 
"Modifications" on page 22) and coded as M3. 
• Verification of the comparability of a proposed accommodation is made on a test-by-test and studentby-student basis.  Do not assume that an accommodation verified as comparable for one student will be deemed comparable for another.  Do not assume that an accommodation verified as comparable one year will be approved for future assessments. 
• The O1 code may only be used after written approval from the AOE/DOE.  Use of the O1 code without 
approval will be treated as a modification for purposes of scoring and reporting (see "Modifications" on page 22). 
 
 
 
 
Modifications (M) 
 
 
M1. Using a graphing calculator on Session 3 of the Science test 
M2. Using an accommodation on this list not approved for a particular test or an accommodation not included on this list without prior approval of the AOE/DOE 
 
 
Considerations for Modifications 
 
Overall: 
• Note that the use of any modification invalidates any and all items impacted within the session(s) in which it is used, and no credit will be given for student performance on those items.  It is important for the school to take this into consideration when choosing whether to allow a modification. 
 
M1. Using a  graphing calculator on Session 3 of the Science test 
 
• Use of a graphing calculator on Session 3 of the Science test will result in all items in the session being scored as incorrect. 
 
 
M3. Using an accommodation on this list not approved for a particular test or an accommodation not included on this list without prior approval of the AOE/DOE 
 
• Proposed accommodations that are determined to be non-comparable are considered modifications and should be coded as M3.  All items impacted by the accommodation will be scored as incorrect. 
 

Section 5: Accommodation Decision Teams 
Procedures  
 
• A school team meets to discuss which, if any, accommodations are appropriate for the student during a state testing situation. The following questions should be discussed when considering appropriate accommodations for students: 
o What accommodation(s) does this student typically need while taking tests in the classroom? o 	Are there unique circumstances created by the NECAP assessment that might require accommodations for this student?  
o Which accommodations, if any, from the Table of Standard Test Accommodations will meet this student's participation requirements? 
o If none of the standard accommodations meet the student's participation requirements, what other accommodations might be proposed? 
o Are there different accommodations needed for the student to participate in each content area tested? 
• Decisions concerning appropriate accommodations for NECAP testing are documented and communicated in order to ensure that the accommodation is implemented effectively and available for future instructional planning. 
• The Accommodation Decision Procedures Worksheet found in Appendix A may be used and copied to facilitate and communicate accommodations planning. Note that this worksheet is keyed to the Table of Standard Test Accommodations. The lettered sections of the Accommodation Decision Procedures Worksheet refer to the same letters in the Table of Standard Test Accommodations beginning on page 8 of this document.  
 
 
 	REMINDER: 
 Not all accommodations that are used for routine instruction are appropriate for NECAP testing. If you are  unsure about the appropriateness use of an accommodation for NECAP testing, contact the 
 Department/Agency of Education to discuss how best to use the accommodation or whether the proposed accommodation is actually a modification.  
 
 
 
Administration: Planning for Needed Resources  
 
Each school will need to prepare for large scale test administration because multiple grades are being tested and multiple accommodations are being implemented. Some important questions to consider are: 
 
• How many spaces will you need to secure for small group and individual administrations of the assessment? 
• How many students need a place where they can read aloud or be read to without disturbing other students who may be working? 
• How many people will then be needed and who should they be? 
• How and when will you train the people who will be administering accommodations?   
 
Administration: Qualified Personnel  
 
Accommodations must be administered by school personnel who are employed by the district and have been trained to administer the assessment. It is preferable that the person administering the accommodation(s) be familiar with and to the student(s). This is especially true for accommodation situations that call for individual settings.  
 
The following are individuals who may not administer NECAP tests: 
 
• Parents and other community volunteers 
• Peer tutors 
• Other students 
 
 
 
Administration: Preparing Test Administrators  
 
Equally as important as identifying appropriate school personnel to administer the test with accommodations is the training and knowledge provided to the administrator prior to administration of the state test. 
 
The following are recommendations for ways to help school personnel prepare to administer the NECAP assessments with one or more accommodations: 
 
• Attend a training session, implemented by the school, which explains and reviews at minimum the Test Administrator Manual and this training guide. 
• Read both the Test Administrator Manual and this training guide prior to test administration. 
• Experience implementing classroom accommodations that are similar to NECAP accommodations. 
• Provide the test booklet on the day of testing, prior to the testing session, so that the test administrator can become familiar with the test form in advance of administration. This is especially true of accommodation administrators who will need to read particular test sessions aloud to a student(s). 
 
 
 	REMINDER: 
Building administrators are required to sign off on the  	Principal's Certification of Proper Test Administration  form, verifying that all test administrators are school personnel and have been properly trained.

 Appendix C: Supporting Students with Limited English Proficiency (LEP/ELL) 
 
NECAP Policy:  NECAP test accommodations are available to all students, regardless of whether or not a disability has been identified.  Accommodations allowed in NECAP testing are not group specific.  For example many students with limited English proficiency benefit from certain language-based accommodations, but like any other student, they sometimes break their arms or develop visual difficulties, and may need accommodations during testing that are very different than the linguistic accommodations often recommended for students in this group.  Before they are members of any subgroup, each student is first an individual with unique learning needs.  NECAP assessment accommodations policy treats students this way.  The decision to allow all students to use the full range of accommodations, as needed, is consistent with prior research on best practice in the provision of accommodations (c.f. Elbaum, Aguelles, Campbell & Saleh, 2004, pp. 71-87).   The NECAP management team believes strongly that a fair and valid path of access to a universally designed test should not require that a student carry any specific group label or disability.  Rather, much like differentiated instruction, accommodated conditions of test participation that preserve the essential construct of the standard being assessed should be supported for any student who has been shown to need these differentiated test conditions.  This philosophy is consistent with the NECAP team's commitment to building a universally accessible test that provides an accurate measure of what each student knows.   
 
NECAP accommodations policy supports the use of many accommodations that are being found to be effective with LEP/ELL students (as identified by the ongoing and growing national research effort).  The purpose of this section is to help teams identify those allowable linguistic accommodations that may prove particularly useful to helping LEP/ELL students show us what they know and are able to do.    
 
It is important to review the LEP NECAP Accommodations Support tables that follow in the context provided by the six statements below, while remembering that research continues to inform and update our understanding of these issues.  For more information on this issue, see also: Resource Note, below.  
 
1. The stage of English language acquisition demonstrated by the individual student must be taken into consideration when choosing the most appropriate accommodations.  For example, students who are beginning English language learners (ELL) do not usually benefit from the use of commonly used 'word-to-word translation' tools.   Development of English language vocabulary skills must be further advanced for this accommodation to prove useful.  In fact, use of word-to-word translation tools too soon can worsen confusion for students very new to the English language.  
 
2. The structure of the first language of the student should be considered when choosing accommodations that may prove useful.  For example, some languages (i.e. Japanese Kanji, Mandarin Chinese, and American Sign) are structured ideographically (contain picture-like symbols).  Other languages (i.e. English, Spanish, French, German) are structured very differently and emphasize other representation formats (i.e. phonetically based symbols).  Depending upon the cultural communication experience of the student, the types of linguistic or other accommodations considered might be different.   
 
3. Accommodation decisions for LEP/ELL students are best informed when educators who have specific training and expertise in second language acquisition are part of the decision making team.  Knowledge of how students acquire a new language after the first language is a specialized area that differs significantly from knowledge of first language acquisition.    
 
4. Translation 'on the fly' is not recommended for most instructional purposes and is not permitted during NECAP assessment.  Misunderstanding and miscommunication is the norm when this technique is used and can create many additional problems.  Teams using this technique must do so with as much training and information as possible. NECAP permits only limited exceptions to this no translation rule: see items P3, P4, and P5 in the chart below for clarification.    Translation of test items or passages, or side-by-side printed translation is never permitted in NECAP testing. 
 
5. In addition, please note that American Sign and Braille languages are not treated as 'foreign language' translations for purposes of NECAP test administration.  These languages are the only means by which some students are able to access certain portions of academic tests.  For this reason, these languages differ from other formal languages for some assessment purposes.    Where permitted, American Sign Language ("sign") and Braille are specifically noted in the NECAP Table of Standard Test Accommodations.   
 
Use of 14 Common Linguistic Accommodations & Supports on the NECAP Tests 
 
The following tables describe the use on the NECAP tests of 14 common linguistic accommodations and supports.  The primary sources used to construct these tables were 
1. NECAP Table of Standard Accommodations, Revised 2016; and  
2. The George Washington University Center for Equity and Excellence in Education, Guide for Refining State Assessment Policies for Accommodating English Language Learners, C. Rivera, B.D. Acosta & L.S. Willner, 2008. 
 
For more information regarding the appropriate use of accommodations will students who show limited English proficiency, see: The Guide for Reining State Assessment Policies for Accommodating English Language Learners, 2008, available at http://ells.ceee.gwu.edu  
 
1. Plain English text used in items and passages Type of Support  
Direct, English language Recommended for  
Intermediate and Advanced English language learners Use on NECAP:

Not applicable.    
2. English language reference materials and supports Type of Support  
Direct, English language Recommended for  
Intermediate and Advanced English language learners Use on NECAP: 
A number of English language reference materials are built into the NECAP tests or provided for use by all students during NECAP testing:    
 In Science tests -  
NECAP provides grade-specific Reference and Formula sheets, and allows calculation aids during all sessions of science (see NECAP Calculator Policy for permitted calculators & limitations.) 
'Think bubble" icons within selected test items help define certain terms  
 Coding as an accommodation on the NECAP Student Answer Booklet 
These are considered Generally Allowable Supports and do not require documentation as an accommodation. However, note that use of a graphing calculator during Science session 3 must be coded as modification M1.
