<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Requests for an accessible document typically raise quite a
few questions. This resource aims to answer those questions and to provide
practical information on how to make HTML, PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents
more accessible to blind users.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Accessibility FAQ section provides some general
background on the importance of creating accessible documents. The General
Considerations portion of this resource guide will cover the major tools that
are used to create accessible documents and some guidelines for using them
effectively. The Specific Technologies section will discuss many of the common
problems, and provide some tips and tricks for remediating these.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All sources used will be cited in the Resources section of
the document and can be reviewed for further information. This guide is only an
overview of the low hanging fruit of accessibility concerns. However, taking
the steps outlined here will cover many of the concerns faced by blind and low
vision users when viewing your documents. For more information on making
products and services accessible to the blind, we invite you to contact the
Access Technology Team at the National Federation of the Blind, whose contact
information will also be in the Resources section of this document. </p>

<h2>Accessibility FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>

<h3>How hard is it to make documents accessible? How long will it take? Is it
expensive?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>We’ve grouped these three questions because they come down
to one simple question: Is creating accessible documents going to require
extraordinary effort? This will depend on context. If you have a simple
project, or if you are just starting a project and can plan it with
accessibility in mind, it will not take much, if any, additional effort to add
the features required to make it accessible. If your project is complex, and
already completed without considering accessibility, then making it accessible
will likely involve spending some time (and sometimes money) on remediation.  Even
with these complex projects, remediating to add accessibility and ensuring that
new features are implemented accessibly will add value to your project far
beyond the benefit of ensuring that blind users and others with disabilities
are able to use it, as detailed below. </p>

<h3>Will it make my project visually unappealing? </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>No. If a document is created accessibly, it can be styled
very effectively without affecting the underlying information.  Many of the
tools that allow for the creation of accessible documents can make the process
of visually styling a document easier. For instance, when creating a data table
in Word, a user can much more easily differentiate the header in a table from
rows of data if they have invoked the option to specify it as a header row,
which also assists screen access users in reviewing the information within the table.
</p>

<h3>Will my project be less functional if it is created to be accessible?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>No. On the contrary, many of the tools used to make
documents accessible will also make them more useful. For example, Word can
automatically generate a table of contents from headings placed in the text.  </p>

<h3>Is it really worth the effort?</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Consider the following:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Accessible documents are useful to more than just blind users.
Most of the features added to increase accessibility also make projects easier
to use for a wide variety of people.</p>

</span></span>It simplifies and improves interactions with blind customers,
employees and employers.  </p>

<h2>General Considerations</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The “Understanding WCAG 2.0” webpage, provided by the W3C
(World Wide Web Consortium), explains that for a webpage to be accessible, it
must meet four criteria. It needs to be:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perceivable
- Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in
ways they can perceive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>This means that users must be able to perceive the information
being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Operable
- User interface components and navigation must be operable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the
interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Understandable
- Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>This means that users must be able to understand the information
as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot
be beyond their understanding)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robust
- Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide
variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:1.25in;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>This means that users must be able to access the content as
technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content
should remain accessible)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>(“<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/"><span style='color:windowtext'>Understanding
WCAG 2.0</span></a>”, W3C)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;line-height:normal'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is important to note that although the WCAG guidelines are
specifically focused on web-based technology, these four principles can be used
to guide the creation of any type of document or media in order to ensure that
it is available and usable to the largest possible audience. The techniques
used to make a document accessible will be similar in all of the document types
we will discuss below. </p>

<h3>Headings </h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Headings are one of the most powerful and simplest tools in
a document creator’s arsenal.  Headings are used to provide structure in a
document. They are visually distinct from body text, but are also semantically
unique, so that blind users utilizing screen access information can jump
between them in order to move to the appropriate section of a document just as
quickly and easily as a sighted user can skim through it. Headings can be created
in Word, PDF and HTML and make it easier for all users to find relevant content
in a long or complex document. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Any given document should contain only one heading level 1. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The heading level 1 is the main idea of your document, or the
main content of your webpage. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Other heading levels can be used as much as makes sense.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Headings should be hierarchical, for instance a heading level 1
should always come before a heading level 2, and level 2 before level 3. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If headings are laid out hierarchically they can be used to
create a table of contents or outline for the document you are presenting.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span> Headings should be relatively short, because short headings are
easier to navigate with screen access software, and keep documents looking and
feeling less cluttered for other readers. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>There are six levels of headings in PDF documents and on the
internet. In Word, up to nine heading levels are available, but in order to
ease transitioning between document formats, it is beneficial to limit the
number of heading levels used to six.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other strategies can also be used to give a document
structure including:</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Ordered (or numbered) and unordered (bulleted lists)</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Proper tables with a brief summary and row and column headers.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Ensuring that columns, text boxes, asides, and other content are
created using a method that allows for proper reading order of the document to
be maintained when it is read with a screen access package.  </p>

<h3>Alternative Text/Text Descriptions of Non-Text Content</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Providing alternative text for items that are not
represented as text on screen is an important and simple way to make your
document accessible. Meaningful text descriptions of visual content make it
possible for someone unable to see the graphics to understand the message you
are trying to convey. Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, and web technologies all
provide methods for adding alternative text to images, charts, graphs, and
other non-textual content. The benefits of this technique go far beyond the
benefit to blind users alone.  For instance, for any content that will end up
on the web, well labeled graphics, graphical links, and other non-text objects
may make it possible for visitors to utilize your website without downloading
large graphics, saving them bandwidth and time. Mobile web users as well as
those in rural locations will thank you for this provision.  Moreover,
meaningful graphic text in web content will improve search engine optimization,
because Google can’t read pictures, but it can read your well-thought-out text descriptions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In order to use text descriptions effectively there are
several things you may want to keep in mind.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Text descriptions of images need to convey the same information
as the images themselves, in the minimum number of words needed to make the
meaning clear. If an image has a text description for all users to view, (such
as explanatory text under a chart), it is not necessary to repeat that information
in the description of the image, but it is important to provide additional description
for relevant information in the image that does not have a text equivalent. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Not all images should be described. Images used for purely
decorative purposes, such as decorative flourishes between links on a webpage,
should be suppressed as they will add nothing to the content being discussed,
and will make it messier and less pleasant to review for screen access users. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If an image contains a picture of text that is supposed to be
read and used by the reader, that text needs to be conveyed in the image
description. For example, a graphical link which reads “products” also needs to
read as “products” in its alt text.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>It is inadvisable to use phrases like such as “image of,” or
“graphic of” in the description of a graphic. This information is redundant as
screen access packages will usually alert blind users that the item being read
is an image; users who have disabled image viewing on a page will be able to
tell where that image should be when browsing the page; and search engines will
not benefit from the information. </p>

<h3>Accessible Table Creation</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tables are critical for conveying certain types of
information. They make it much easier to make sense of data, and to draw
conclusions from large amounts of information. They are used in every
technology discussed in this document. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Therefore, it is critical to ensure that tables are produced
in such a way that they can be read and manipulated with screen access
software.  The following tips should help to guide you in building tables that
everyone can use. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Avoid creating pseudo tables, which are only visually presented
as tables, and not semantically created as tables in the software package you
are using. For instance, some people will use tab stops to create “tables” in
Word, but these cannot be understood as tables by screen access users as they
are really just text so far as the software is concerned. These pseudo tables
are also far less flexible for designers, and more difficult to update and
change than if the creator of the document used a real table.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span> Use as much structural markup as is available in your chosen
design tool.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In HTML or PDF, a creator can specify header rows and columns as
well as a brief summary of the purpose of any given table.  These elements all
should be used to assist users reading the table.  </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In Word, on the other hand, row headers are not available, but
column headers should be used, as well as a brief textual description of the
purpose of a table to clarify its purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>It’s important to avoid having empty header cells. Since header
cells provide context for users, of screen access software, empty cells will
create confusion when reviewing a data table.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Layout tables, tables intended to create a visual appearance, and
not to provide information in a tabular form, are especially difficult to make
useful to all users. They make it harder to resize information, can confuse
reading order for screen access users, and can make it much harder for mobile
device users to find information on a page or document that will make sense.
Avoid them wherever possible. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span

</span></span>Tables with merged cells and other complex layouts are more
likely to confuse users, both sighted and blind. Even if a cell contains
“duplicate” information it is easier to read if the table is laid out as a
proper grid.  </p>

<h3>Meaningful Link Text</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is important to remember to create links that make sense
to screen access users. Many screen access products allow users to pull up a
list of links in a document or webpage, and sometimes users will tab through
the links on a page in order to get a feel for the page, or to look for
specific types of content. In order to allow users to quickly find the
information they are seeking when using these skimming tools, there are several
best practices that can and should be employed when creating links. Once again,
like most other topics in this article, creating meaningful link text will also
assist other users of your site who may be merely skimming for information.  </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='margin-left:38.35pt;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Avoid ambiguous link text, like “click here”, “go,” or “here”.
Creating links with meaningful text will require a little extra thought on
wording when writing content, but will make for clearer content for all users.
It also makes creation of multi-format documents easier, because link text is
largely a web technology that may not appear in a PDF or Word document of the
same content (though it certainly could if the creator so chose).</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:38.35pt;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Avoid duplicate link text. If there are several “go” links on a
webpage, a user skimming the content, (blind or sighted) will have to stop and
review context to make sense of where they are going.  </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:38.35pt;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Use consistent, commonly used link text for common purposes
whenever possible. For instance, most web pages offer a link to “Contact Us” or
“Contact” which leads to a contact page. Many screen access users will be able
to jump directly to links that begin with a particular letter, and when looking
for contact information will try the “C” key in order to find this information
quickly.  Similarly, when creating a web page it is important to use the same
link titles to reach the same destinations no matter what page a user is on
(unless this would break a path or a process). For instance, all pages on a
shopping site may want to have links to the “Shopping Cart”, product
categories, and “Sales”. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:38.35pt;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Keep link text short and to the point. Giving too much
information in a link makes it more difficult to read, and makes it less clear.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:38.35pt;text-indent:
-.25in'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Avoid using the words “link to” when creating link text. Screen
access packages already announce links, and this will help to avoid redundancy.
“Link Contact Us” is more pleasant to hear (or read) than “Link Link to Contact
Us”. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:38.35pt;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Do not create empty links. Links should always contain text, or
graphics, (with appropriate alt text) or they will be confusing to keyboard and
screen access users. </p>

<h3>Forms, Buttons, Checkboxes, and Other Interactive Controls</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>When creating interactive elements, it is necessary to have
labels which ensure that blind users are able to determine what these elements
are, what they do, and how to interact with them. Adding labels to form
elements and ensuring that they are properly associated will also assist in
cataloging web resources. Some of these controls are rare in documents, but
will be especially useful in specialized contexts like PDF forms or HTML files.
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Checkboxes, radio buttons, and other question/answer type
interactive elements should be associated with a question, and the
boxes/buttons themselves need to be explicitly associated with the answer they
represent, otherwise screen access users may find that they are unable to
identify the question being asked, or what answer is associated with the
control. When moving through a form, it is difficult to determine whether to
answer “yes” or “no” without the question. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Combo boxes, edit fields and text boxes need to be labeled as
well, and not merely have the text label next to them visually on screen.
Unless a label is associated explicitly with the box, a user cannot tell what
they should place in the box.  The text labels that sit next to (or above, or
below) these boxes visually will not be reliable markers as they are not always
in the same place in relation to these boxes, and therefore could confuse users
who are relying on the information they provide. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>It is important wherever possible to include the same text on
buttons as in button descriptions.  For example, some buttons may visually be
styled with the word “Go” and may have an alternative text label of “submit”. 
If a blind user is working with a sighted user on the same document or webpage,
if a low vision user is using a combination of vision and non-visual
techniques, or if a user utilizing dictation and spoken navigation attempt to
find or activate this button, the fact that its label and visual contents do
not match will be confusing and may cause difficulty in navigating the page. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Buttons and image-based links should contain meaningful text
equivalents. For example, if a button is labeled as “Go” visually, it should
contain the word “Go” in its description, but it also needs to tell a user
where it is going.  This is especially important if there are multiple buttons
or links that contain the same text.  For example, “Go to the project page” and
“Go to my account”(alternatively “Account: Go” or “Project: Go”) are going to
be far more meaningful to blind users than encountering multiple “Go” buttons
without any further context. </p>

<h3>Design Considerations</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Document accessibility involves a number of different
factors. Choices made to improve the visual appearance of a project may hinder
or enhance readability for all users. Furthermore, access to documents
encompasses word choice and sentence structure. Finally, it comes down to
checking your work to ensure that the document you have created is meeting the
needs it was created to fulfill. The below guidelines are a sample of the types
of things that should be considered when creating a document, that were not
covered in other sections of this article.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The appropriate use of whitespace will make your project easier
to understand and clearer for all users.  Blind users will not notice this so
much, but elderly, low vision, and users with cognitive or motor control issues
will benefit greatly from a document that is neither overly busy nor overly
sparse.  All users will find such a document or site easier to navigate and
more pleasant to use. When considering whitespace issues, be sure to consider
the fonts you are using and ensure that they are easily read, and not too thin
to provide good contrast. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Similarly, make sure that your document offers strong contrast to
aid users with low vision, or those using small screen devices. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Check that your document can easily scale in size as this will
make it easier to view for many users.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When writing content, avoid writing poor link text like “click
here” in order to increase the readability of your document for all users. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, and most importantly, when creating documents and
websites, particularly of a complex nature, it is critical to work with blind
users, or other users with disabilities to ensure that the document has been
created accessibly.  User testing is the only sure way to verify that your
message is able to actually reach its intended audience.   </p>

<h2>Specific Technologies</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each of these technologies has a unique purpose and they are
most powerful when they are used to fulfill that specific purpose. They also
tend to be most accessible when filling the roles for which they were designed.
For instance, although it is possible to create a fillable form in either PDF
or Word, neither of these packages are ideally suited to the task, and a
creator may find it much harder to create accessible forms in these formats
than if they had simply chosen to use HTML. Therefore, when deciding what
format a project should be available in, it is important to consider the
purpose of the project and how it will be used. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once the decision on the project purpose is made, making
each format accessible with the tools provided will enhance the quality and
usability of each project for all of its users. To this end, this section
briefly describes each technology, its strengths, weaknesses and the most
common accessibility barriers encountered by blind users in each format along
with some simple fixes and best practices for each.  </p>

<h3>HTML Documents</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The web is made up of a number of technologies, and is used
for a myriad of purposes. The heart of the web, even today, is HTML.  HTML
creates structure for webpages, and contains mechanisms for resolving the majority
of problems encountered by blind users.  While routinely used on the web, HTML
is also used to create off-line, stand-alone documents with the same look and
feel as websites.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Unlabeled elements: Whether it’s a button, a graphic, a link, or
an edit box, unlabeled elements continue to be one of the greatest barriers to
web access for blind users. If an element cannot be identified, it cannot be
used. The good news is that this problem, in all its myriad forms, is easy to
remedy. Every web element offers a meaningful way to label it. Graphics offer
alt tags, edit boxes and buttons have labels, and links contain the option for
link text.  As previously mentioned, using these tools improves a web
experience for all users, and the hardest part of adding these labels is simply
finding the elements on your page that might need them. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Lack of headings and other proper page structure: There is little
more frustrating than coming across a webpage and hearing that it has 153
links, and no headings. Headings, lists, tables and other structural elements
give all users useful information about where to quickly find information on a
web page. Visually these elements make information distinct, and structurally,
they make it possible for blind users to quickly move through the page, and skim
for information exactly like sighted users viewing the pages.  Using style
elements for their intended purpose will allow you to create beautiful and
usable websites that are easier to navigate for the user, and easy to update
for the creator. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Poorly planned tables:   Data tables without column and row
headers, and some form of caption or other summary are very confusing for blind
users, and slow them down greatly when they are attempting to read a web page. Therefore,
it is important to mark column and row headers and provide a summary for tables
when creating them. In the same way, layout tables that break the reading order
of a web page, or confuse the way that the page is conveyed non-visually will
make it much less pleasant to browse a given site. For this reason, it is best
practice to use another tool, (such as CSS) to create the same effect as the
layout table is intended to convey.  As mentioned earlier, this will make the
page easier to change for future creators.    </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Embedded Flash content: Adobe Flash has been a very popular tool
in the past for creating interactive content in HTML files, and can be made
accessible, but the majority of Flash content has not been built with
accessibility in mind. Much of the Flash content on the web was written in such
a way that it requires the use of a mouse to control, or it will trap the
user’s keyboard, so they cannot exit the applet and review the rest of the
page. It may also contain sound and other features that would mask a user’s
access technology.   However, at this point, accessibility is only one of a
number of reasons to avoid creating Flash content. It is not supported on the
majority of mobile devices, and has been implicated in a number of fairly high
priority security vulnerabilities.  For this reason, Flash use should be
carefully considered, and if it is chosen as the right technology, it is highly
recommended that designers visit Adobe’s and other resources for making Flash
content accessible. </p>

<h3>Word</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Word is a powerful word processor and is used in businesses
all around the world for creating well formatted documents. It is also one of
the most powerful tools available for creating accessible documents. Due to its
flexibility and its fairly robust accessibility features, it is the most
versatile platform on the market for creating documents that are accessible and
easily converted to other formats. Word documents can easily be used to create
other forms of accessible content, including Braille, EPUB and PDF. In order to
make the most out of this platform, and to make accessible documents in Word,
it is helpful to remember a few simple instructions.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Use headings: Many Word users will create “fake” headings by
writing a line of text, and then styling it with a different font, color, and
size of text. This creates “headings” that can be used by sighted users, but
not those who are blind.  If instead, these users select a proper heading from
the “Styles” section of the home ribbon, and modify that style as needed, they
will be working with a much more powerful and accessible tool. As we have
discussed throughout this document, the use of actual headings to structure
documents makes them far more flexible, and makes them much easier to read for
blind users.  The benefits of using the heading styles go far beyond this
benefit however. Headings can also be used to create a table of contents for
your document, and can allow for quick formatting because the document designer
can simply change the look of each heading style and have it automatically
applied to each of the headings of that level in the document, thus making
formatting simpler and more uniform. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Create tables using Word’s table creation tool:  Like with headings,
many users creating tables have used a workaround instead of the tool provided
by Word.  Instead of using the Table option in the “Insert” ribbon, they create
a visual table using tab-stops.  These methods produce a less flexible document
which is also less accessible to blind users.  By using the table creation
tool, document creators will find it much easier to build tables that are
easier to edit, and easier to style. Moreover, by ticking the Header rows
checkbox in table design, they provide blind users with information on which
rows act as headers in the table. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Don’t use tables for layout: The flipside of using tables to
organize data is that tables should not be used to create a visual appearance
in a document.   When this happens, a blind user will find that the document
does not flow as well, and is harder to read.  Layout tables may also break the
reading order of the document and cause it to cease to make sense. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tag images with text descriptions:   Just like on the web, blind
users regularly find themselves needing to gather information from a picture or
a graph in a Word document. Without well-thought-out image tags, they will not
have any way to know what the image is conveying, and will be at a loss when
trying to work with your document. </p>

<h3>Excel</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Excel and its myriad tables can seem overwhelming<b> </b>when
one is attempting to create accessible documents, but with some planning, Excel
workbooks can be made quite accessible to blind users. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Unlabeled charts and other graphics are a problem regularly encountered
by blind users of Excel, and, like in Word, these charts and graphics can
receive appropriate label text to improve them.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Unique sheet names will increase the usability of different
workbooks, because users can easily move between sheets and know what they are
getting.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Avoid blank cells used for formatting purposes, as these can be disorienting
for some users. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add column headers using the same method discussed in the Word
section of this document. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In addition to using the column headers option in table creation,
the users of JAWS, and certain other access technologies can utilize row and
column headers that have been named as such in the document. Information on how
to name these cells is available in the JAWS Help topics, in the software’s
installed documentation. If you wish to learn how this can be accomplished and
do not have access to JAWS, please contact the access technology team for
further information. </p>

<h3>PowerPoint</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having access to PowerPoint slide decks can be very useful
for blind users when listening to your presentation, or afterwards, just as
they are for other users. Many of the accessibility concerns encountered with
PowerPoint are, like most others in this document, quite simple to fix, and
only require a bit of forethought. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Proper reading order is important to understanding the contents
of a slide. Luckily, it is fairly easy to ensure that the correct reading order
is maintained. If the creator uses one of the default slide layouts provided by
PowerPoint, the reading order should be preserved when they are adding content.
</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Ensure that your slide labels are unique so that users can figure
out where in the presentation they are, and that they do not miss information. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Embedded audio and video content: Controls for embedded content
are unreliable, so a better solution is to package any audio and video content
with the PowerPoint file but not embed it directly.  This will allow the user
to view the content with their media player of choice.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When video is included, ensure that a transcript is available to
assist deaf-blind users. It will also be of use in creating captions for deaf
participants, and adult language learners. Furthermore, for videos containing
action or foreign language subtitles, it is important to have the video
described for blind users.  </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Ensure that images have been labeled, so that they are meaningful
to blind users. </p>

<h3>PDF</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>PDF (Portable Document Format) was built originally to
create documents that could be transferred anywhere and continue to look the
same, regardless of the device they are being viewed on, and what fonts and
other visual elements may be available on the device. For most end users, they
are a read-only format, as the applications available for editing them are
quite expensive, and can be quite difficult to use. These facts are both the
greatest strengths and weaknesses of the format. PDFs were not originally
created to be reflowable, or easy to change so as to make them easier to read
for low vision users or users of small mobile devices, and although this has
been changed in recent versions of the document type, most are still not easily
used in these circumstances. They are easy to make, but difficult to change, so
it can be tricky to remediate them.  All in all, this makes them a difficult
document type to recommend when others are more flexible.  That being said,
sometimes, PDF is considered to be the best tool for the job, precisely because
of the reasons mentioned above, and there are several things that designers can
do to ensure that their PDFs can be read by all users. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Ensure that your PDF is not merely an image of text.  Some
applications will create PDFs by printing a picture of the original content.
Furthermore, many PDFs, particularly of older print material, were created by scanning
the original document, and binding these images into a single file.  If you
scan a document, ensure that you have also run it through optical character
recognition software, and if you are creating a PDF from another source, ensure
that it is actually encoding the text of your document in the PDF, and not just
pictures of it. When creating a PDF from a Word document for example, save the
document as a PDF, do not print to PDF. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tag your PDFs. When a PDF is created in some programs, or without
the accessibility checkbox checked in Word, the text will be made available,
but screen access users will have no structure in their document. It would read
as one large wall of text, without headings, lists, and proper table markup,
which is virtually unusable.  Tags can only be manipulated in programs like Adobe
Acrobat, but the majority of tagging can be carried over from Word documents
and some other sources saved as PDFs. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Ensure that the reading order in your PDF is logical. Because
PDFs were built to be visually complex documents that will not change, many
PDFs can be difficult to read with screen access software.  Unless proper
reading order is established in the PDF’s tag structure, a user might find that
two visually separate columns are reading jumbled together, or that the section
they were reading is cut off mid-section by a text box. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tag graphics. Like all other document types discussed in this
article, PDF offers a way to tag images, and it should be utilized to ensure
that blind users can make full use of your document. </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tags can and should be used to add headers to table structure as
well as basic document structure.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>PDF Forms:  Fillable PDFs can be made accessible, but the amount
of effort is not trivial. Consider creating forms in web format for the easiest
implementation of accessibility. If a fillable PDF is required, consult Adobe’s
resources on creating accessible PDFs for further information.</p>

<h3>Braille</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Braille is the tactile code used by blind people to read and
write. Braille documents today are created most often via use of transcription
software and well-formatted source documents. Many blind people will use
notetakers and electronic Braille displays to view files and other resources
such as webpages tactilely.  This provides the blind user with the ability to
review text in detail, and read far more carefully than they are able to using
audio solutions alone.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the best known and most widely used Braille
translation packages in the United States, (and possibly the world) is the
Duxbury Braille Translator. It is a Braille translation and formatting package
that can be used to turn print documents into Braille documents.  If a file is
marked up properly, it will translate more easily, and require less work from a
Braille transcriptionist (a person who manually corrects and creates Braille
documents for embossing onto paper or digital distribution), </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Creating Braille files is beyond the scope of this document;
however, there are a number of steps you can take in order to prepare a file
for Brailling.  Most of these steps will be quite familiar to you after
reviewing other sections of this article.  </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>When possible, start your Braille document from Microsoft Word. 
Other formats are supported, but Word offers the cleanest and most robust
platform for creating multi-format documents.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Use styles.  As you have seen throughout this document, the use
of styles, like headings, and lists, creates documents that are more easily
organized and manipulated. Styles are especially important when bringing a
document into another format, such as Braille, because if they are not used,
much of the document’s formatting will be lost, and will need to be re-created.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Avoid Word Art as it is actually a picture of text, and will not
translate for your users.</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Remember to appropriately tag images in the document, and
consider carefully the need for the image in the first place.  Braille
documents, particularly those read on electronic Braille displays are sometimes
ill-suited to providing pictorial information, and special care must be taken
to ensure that any meaning conveyed visually is also conveyed textually.  </p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpLast style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Simplify any tables in your document, as Braille does take more
space than print on a page, so less room is available for fitting text into
tabular form. Due to this limitation, creators of Braille documents which
include tables will highly benefit from working with an experienced
transcriptionist.  </p>

National Federation of the Blind is the largest organization of blind and
low-vision people in the United States. Founded in 1940, the Federation has
grown to over fifty-thousand members. The organization consists of affiliates
and local chapters in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto
Rico.&nbsp;</span></p>

National Federation of the Blind knows that blindness is not the characteristic
that defines blind people or our future. Every day we raise the expectations of
blind people, because low expectations create obstacles between blind people
and our dreams. Blind people can live the life they want; blindness is not what
holds us back.&nbsp;</span></p>

this end, the Access Technology Team at the Jernigan institute works with blind
people, leaders in education and business, and other interested members of the
public to increase awareness of accessibility and the tools available to blind

blind individuals, educators and employers about the most accessible and usable
tools for their needs, to guiding creators of technology who are working to
make their products accessible, to assisting in creating and endorsing
standards and best practices in the creation of accessible and usable
technology for all users. Therefore, we welcome any opportunity to work with
you and your organization in ensuring that your documents and websites are
