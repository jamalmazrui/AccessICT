<h2><a name="_Toc382293738">Purpose</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This document provides information for Texas state agency
staff about accessibility issues, requirements and options for multimedia
projects.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc382293739">Introduction</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not too long ago, websites were relatively flat and boring.
Slower connection speeds meant that videos, audio files and other forms of
multimedia were rare on Web pages. For most of us, however, those days are now
long gone. With the pervasiveness of high-speed Internet in homes, workplaces
and public access points, the Web is increasingly dynamic and engaging, and
content creators have many new and powerful ways of communicating with their
audiences. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Multimedia communication has risks as well as advantages, and
must be done thoughtfully to be accessible. A person who is deaf or
hearing-impaired may miss out on important information if that information is
presented only in a video or audio file. If information is presented visually
in a video without an audio element, such as the video’s credits, a person who
is blind will not have access to that content. Also, multimedia may create
technical difficulties for people who don’t have functional speakers or headphones,
people with slow Internet connections, or people using mobile devices, among
others. Finally, many people prefer text-based forms of communication over
multimedia and may not appreciate being forced to watch videos to get
information.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Both the benefits to multimedia and the possible issues
related to multimedia are discussed in more detail below. Because multimedia is
an important and useful method of conveying information, methods for making multimedia
accessible and useful to as many people as possible are also described below. TWC
is committed to providing accessible multimedia whenever it is appropriate and
feasible.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc382293740">Benefits of Multimedia</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people mistakenly believe that accessible Web content
must be flat and boring, with little color, no images and no video, but there
are many benefits to multimedia for accessibility. In fact, while creating
content that is beautifully-designed, dynamic and also accessible sometimes
creates unique challenges, good design—including appropriate use of video—absolutely
has its place. For example, videos can create issues for people who are deaf,
but for a person who is dyslexic or has a cognitive impairment, pages and pages
full of unstructured text can be overwhelming and difficult to comprehend. For
these people, a video version of the content may be the <b>most</b> accessible
option!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Who else benefits from videos? Nearly everyone benefits from
proper use of video. Some content, such as complex processes, may be difficult
to explain in text alone. For example, an article explaining exactly how to
create an accessible Microsoft Word document may not get the information across
as easily for many people as a video demonstrating the technique. Since more
and more training is moving out of the classroom and onto the Web, a video can
maintain the personal touch of an actual instructor, which many people find
helpful.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc382293741">Who Is Affected by Multimedia Inaccessibility Issues?</a></h2>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293742">Hearing-Impaired People</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Multimedia content, which is any format in which an audio
stream and a video element are synchronized, often has the greatest impact on
people who cannot hear the audio, particularly people who are deaf or hearing impaired.
</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293743">Blind and Visually-Impaired People</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>While we may think of multimedia accessibility as primarily
an issue for people who are deaf or hearing impaired, those who are blind or
visually impaired also can be affected. For many videos it’s possible to get
all the relevant information just by listening to the audio, however some
videos include content that is displayed but not spoken. For example, a video
of an auditorium lecture may be very understandable to someone who cannot see
the visual feed. However, if (to continue the example) the lecturer displays a
bulleted list of topics, which the sighted user can see but the unsighted user
is unaware of, that unsighted user is missing important communication.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Additionally, even when the multimedia itself is accessible
to people who are blind (meaning that all the information is available through
the audio track only), the multimedia player—the group of buttons you use to
start and stop the video—may be inaccessible to a blind person’s screen reader
software. There are many different multimedia player technologies, and while
many are accessible, this can still be a major issue for blind people. The multimedia
player accessibility issue also affects anyone else whose disability requires
that he or she use a keyboard without the mouse.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293744">Everyone Else</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Remember that accessibility isn’t an isolated issue; it is
not separate from good design. Everyone has a unique set of needs, experiences,
and limitations, which may impact how they interact with video. For example,
more and more people use tablets like the iPad and other mobile devices to
access the Web, and these devices don’t play all types of videos. Mobile users
also are more likely to be accessing the Web over cellular data connections,
which are slower and less reliable, so they may prefer not to watch a video
even if it is available.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Other people may work in a cubicle where playing audio would
be disturbing and inappropriate. If they don’t have a pair of headphones, they
may choose not to watch a video. Alternatively, your audience may be in a noisy
environment like an airport or a coffee shop and would not be able to hear the
audio.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While access to multimedia on the Web has come a long way in
the last decade, there are still many people who are unable to watch videos
because of bandwidth issues. Many of those people work at businesses that block
video or audio streaming, including YouTube access, because of bandwidth or
other concerns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, some people learn best by reading text and looking
at pictures. They may get annoyed if they have to watch a video to get the
content. These people may be looking for an answer to a specific question and
don’t want to sit through the video to see if the answer is in the video, or
they may prefer to skim quickly through pages of content. A video would not be
an ideal format for these people. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc382293745">Accessibility Techniques</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is important to include accessibility, and any related
budget requirements, from the initial planning of a project. When you are aware
of the issues involved, it may be easier to see the benefits of making your
content available to as many people as possible in an optimal format (described
below) as well-worth the financial cost. If you wait to consider accessibility
late in the process or after a video is fully developed, the costs of
implementing accessibility may be greater. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To make multimedia content accessible, you may be using one
or more methods.  Some tools or techniques make the multimedia more usable to
people with a variety of disabilities and to people without a disability. Some
tools are more specialized and address the needs of a specific audience.  Commonly
used approaches to accessible multimedia content include use of transcripts,
captions, and/or audio description.  </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293746">Transcripts</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>A transcript is a text- version of the content in the
multimedia presentation. Users read the transcript at their own pace. A
transcript must contain all of the content spoken in the video, so minutes from
a meeting are not an acceptable transcript unless, for example, a court
reporter transcribes everything said during the meeting. Ideally, transcripts
are placed directly beneath the multimedia player in the browser window or on
another linked Web page (in HTML), but may be placed in a separate accessible Microsoft
Word or PDF document. </p>

<h4>Benefits of Transcripts</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Much of the legal discussion later in this paper centers on
whether a transcript represents a legitimate accessibility alternative means of
access. Leaving that discussion aside, transcripts have several key benefits,
and even if you use captions, you should consider also including a transcript.
For example:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Screen reader users, who often set their program’s speech
     rate to be much higher than normal speech, may prefer to listen to the
     transcript than listen to the slower narration in the video.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Users with or without a disability may also not want to
     take the time to watch video but will skim the transcript.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>People with cognitive impairments that prevent them from
     comprehending audio may prefer to read the transcript at their own pace.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>People who are dyslexic and unable to hear the audio may
     not be able to keep up with quickly-changing caption text and may prefer
     to read the transcript at their own pace.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>People with technical issues that prevent them from
     accessing the video have the transcript as a fallback option.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Search engines like Google cannot index the content of a
     video, but can index the transcript, making your information more
     available to people who are searching the Web.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Similarly, people who want to share a quote from your
     video or note important information can copy that information directly
     from the transcript rather than having to retype what was spoken.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>A transcript is the only accessible alternative for
     audio-only content, such as a podcast, or video-only content, such as a
     self-advancing picture slideshow.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Limitations of Transcripts</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite their benefits, transcripts have limitations that
prevent them from providing truly equivalent experiences for people with
disabilities. For example:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>People cannot get information conveyed visually and
     audibly at the same time. Even “talking head” videos provide the audience
     with facial expressions and other cues which you can’t get by reading a
     transcript, and in complex videos, a great deal of visual information is
     left out of the transcript.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Videos can be easily distributed without the associated
     transcript, because the transcript is a separate file. For instance,
     videos hosted on YouTube or another multimedia hosting site will not
     include the transcript. Videos that are linked as downloadable files to be
     played on the viewer’s desktop can be downloaded, played, and forwarded
     without the transcript document, which is a separate download.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Publishing a transcript requires having a text copy of
     what was spoken in the video. For scripted videos, getting the transcript
     will be a relatively simple task, but for “talking head” videos and other
     unscripted content, creating a transcript requires listening to the
     content and transcribing the text. For long videos, it may be necessary to
     contract with a professional transcriptionist.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>In their simplest form, transcripts can be very difficult
     to read. Many people find it difficult to read large blocks of text that
     are not created using basic document formatting styles such as paragraphs
     and section headings. See the section below titled Transcripts: Tips for
     Going “Above and Beyond” for further discussion.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to Create Transcripts</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scripted Content:  Depending on the type of multimedia you
are creating, a transcript may the easiest or the most complicated
accessibility resource to develop. For scripted content such as training skits
or prepared speeches, you can use the video’s script as the basis of your
transcript. Since a transcript should include all the words spoken and other
audio content, you may need to revise the script to include information about, for
example, any music played or other sound effects. For scripted speeches, the
transcript may need to be modified to reflect instances when the speaker went
off-script. The script may also need to be modified to fit into an easy-to-read
transcript format.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Non-Scripted Content:  For non-scripted multimedia content,
you will need to manually transcribe the video. For relatively short or simple
videos, you can do this yourself by watching the video and writing down everything
spoken in the video and any other sound effects. However, it is often more
cost- and time-efficient to hire a professional transcriptionist, who will use
tools similar to those of a court reporter to quickly create and then edit a
transcript. As a pricing example, Automatic Sync Technologies (linked in the
Resources section) will currently provide a transcript to government agencies for
$1.60/minute with a three-day turnaround. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A third option is to use an automated-captioning service,
which will use speech-to-text recognition algorithms to automatically guess the
words spoken in the video. For example, when you upload video to YouTube, the
video will be automatically captioned if the sound quality is adequate.  You
can upload a video to YouTube, have YouTube automatically create a caption file
from the spoken text (or automatically add timing information if you already
have a transcript), and then you can download that caption file to edit and
revise as needed. In this way, YouTube is not your hosting solution, but is
your captioning tool. Because this technology is fairly new and often guesses
incorrectly, you will need to download the transcript file that is created and
edit it to reflect what was actually spoken in the video. This is an issue you
don’t need to worry about when working with a professional transcriptionist,
but automatic captioning tools usually make the task of manually creating a
transcript much more manageable. </p>

<h4>Transcripts: Tips for Going “Above and Beyond”</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>While not required to meet minimum legal standards, some
steps can be taken to make a multimedia transcript especially usable to as many
people as possible. For example, because the benefits of a transcript extend
beyond meeting the needs of people who are deaf or hearing impaired, you may
want to consider adding images, headings, and maybe even a table of contents to
the transcript. Images such as charts, graphs, or screenshots can help explain
all the content that was seen in the video. Section headings and a table of contents
make it easier for people to read the transcript and to find sections of
particular interest. If done correctly, the transcript becomes a text version
(or static version) of the content and the multimedia is a complementary dynamic
version of the content. Ideally, this rich text version would be on the same
Web page as the video itself or stored in the same location, because this is
the most intuitive solution for the user and the easiest for the developer to
implement. However, if needed, the text version could be on another Web page or
in a separate downloadable document.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293747">Captions</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>For people with hearing loss and for many other people,
captions are the best way to make a video accessible and usable, because they
can watch the video and read the synchronized text equivalent at the same time.
There are two types of captions: open captions and closed captions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Open captions are embedded into the video file, which means
they automatically display and cannot be turned off. The subtitles that appear
on a screen in a movie when a foreign language is spoken are an example of open
captions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Closed captions are stored in a separate caption stream,
which means that they may or may not automatically appear when the video is
played, depending on the settings of the video player, and the user has the
option to disable the caption stream if desired or change the appearance and
formatting of the captions to be as visible as possible. Additionally, with
some multimedia players, the video developer can include multiple caption
streams, such as captions in other languages, and the viewer chooses the
caption stream that meets their needs.</p>

<h4>Benefits of Captions</h4>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>People with hearing loss may be able to view the visual
     information in a video (facial expressions, text content in the video,
     etc.) while they read a text-version of the audio content at the same
     time.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Non-native English speakers and other English language learners
     often can more easily understand written text in captions.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>People in loud environments or without usable speakers or
     headphones can watch the video with the audio muted and use the captions
     instead.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Like transcripts, closed captions can be indexed by search
     engines, making the content available to people searching the Web. (Open
     captions are part of the video stream, so there is no text to index.)</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>With minimal extra work, it’s even possible to set up
     captioned videos such that search results take the user to the exact point
     in the video when their search term was spoken, so people don’t have to
     watch an entire video to find the specific phrase that they are looking
     for.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Captions clarify the content when the video has poor audio
     quality or the speaker has a strong accent that makes the content
     difficult to understand.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Limitations of Captions</h4>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Closed captions require a multimedia player that allows
     the user to enable or disable captions. When providing a multimedia player
     with caption controls is not possible (for example, when the multimedia will
     be downloaded by the user and played in their own desktop multimedia program),
     open captions embedded in the multimedia file may be necessary.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>People who are dyslexic and unable to hear the audio may
     not be able to keep up with quickly-changing caption text and may prefer
     to read a transcript at their own pace.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>While captions make a video accessible to people who are
     deaf or hearing impaired, people who are visually impaired may need
     additional alternative means of access in the form of audio description
     (explained below). </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Open captions will pixelate as the video is enlarged, and
     depending on the video may become unreadable at full screen resolution.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to Create Captions</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because captions are just a version of the transcript that
is synchronized with the video, the first step in creating captions is to
create a transcript file, the process for which is detailed in the transcript
section. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With an accurate transcript of everything spoken in the
video, plus all sound effects, all that remains is to add timing information to
the transcript file, which tells the player exactly when in the video to
display the captions. There are numerous tools that help you do this. In some
tools, you simply watch the video at regular speed and click a button at the
moment you want the captions to change, and the tool will tag the caption file
with the timestamp that the video player needs. Other tools take the existing
transcript file and use speech-to-text technology to guess when the words are
spoken in the video. While the speech-to-text technology is very inconsistent
about guessing words to create the transcript (as explained in the transcript
section), the technology will usually do a much better job guessing when words
from your existing transcript are spoken in the video. Remember, as described
in the How to Create Transcripts section, you can use YouTube to automatically
create a transcript even if you do not plan to use YouTube to host your video,
and YouTube will automatically add caption timing information to that transcript.
Similarly, you can upload a transcript that you’ve created to YouTube and
YouTube will use speech-to-text technology to automatically add timing
information. The caption file can be downloaded and used in elsewhere. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, if you are already using a vendor to create the
transcript, it may be cost-effective to have the vendor create the caption file
as well. As a pricing example, Automatic Sync Technologies (linked in the
Resources section) currently will provide a transcript and captions to
government agencies for $3.08/minute with a three-day turnaround.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When possible, try to place captions on the video where they
do not obscure important information like text subtitles (such as a person’s
name in an interview video); because many video players limit placement of the
captions to the bottom of the screen, it’s a good idea to keep this in mind
when creating a video and avoid placing text subtitles at the bottom of the
screen where captions will appear.</p>

<h4>Captions: Tips for Going “Above and Beyond”</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>While open captions are a suitable option that may be
required depending on the multimedia player used, closed captions give the
viewer the most flexibility in choosing whether captions are displayed and how
they are formatted. Also, some of the benefits to captions described above are
only applicable to closed captions; for example, for captions to be indexed by
search engines like Google, the captions need to be stored in a separate text
caption file (or you need to include a transcript on the page). The actual captions
file is not visible to the user, but the multimedia player reads this text file
as does the search engine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another way to go “above and beyond” is to choose a multimedia
player and caption format that allows the searching of captions so the user can
jump to the exact point in the video when their search term was spoken. While
many people are unfamiliar with the feature, captioned YouTube videos are
automatically set up to allow the user to view the transcript and skip forward
and backward through the video by clicking on a line in the transcript. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because closed captions allow the user to select the caption
file that meets their needs, it’s a nice benefit to translate the transcript
into other languages that your audience may prefer and make those caption files
available. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, one more optional way to communicate the auditory
content of some videos is to include a “picture-in-picture” video feed of
someone interpreting the audio content into American Sign Language. You will
need high resolution video so that the video can be made large enough for the
interpreter’s hands to be easily “read.”</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293748">Audio Description</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes in videos there is content that is only available
when you can see the video. For example, the video may include a slide of text
that is not narrated in any way; for a person who is blind or for anyone who is
not looking at the screen during that moment, that text is not available. Per
Section 508 and WCAG 2.0 AA, it may be necessary to include an audio equivalent
of any non-audible content. Like captions, the audio description can be either
a permanent part of the video’s audio track or it can be a separate audio track
that the user can enable or disable if needed. In either case, someone
describes the important visual action taking place on screen in the gaps
between the existing dialogue and sound effects. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note: Per WCAG 2.0 AA, audio description is necessary only
for pre-recorded multimedia, so live streams do not need audio description.
However, it’s still a best practice for the live presenter to explain any
visual content such as PowerPoint slides. Additionally, if the live stream is
later archived, you may need to include audio description.</p>

<h4>Benefits of Audio Description</h4>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>People who are visually-impaired can watch a video and
     have access to all of the important information.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>People with cognitive impairments may find this
     information helps them process visual content more easily. For example, a
     person with autism may have difficulty reading facial expressions and
     would benefit from having those expressions explicitly described.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>When videos are displayed in auditoriums or brightly-lit
     rooms, it may be difficult for some people to see everything happening
     visually in the video, so they may benefit from having all the information
     available as audio. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>The viewer may look away from the video or open another
     window on their computer, especially in the case of long videos. This is
     especially true when all of the visual information so far has also been
     communicated through the audio and the user is expecting that the audio
     channel will continue to provide all the important information.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Limitations of Audio Description</h4>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Because audio description has to fit in the gaps in the
     existing soundtrack, it’s often impossible to sufficiently describe all the
     visual information with audio description.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Audio description can be very distracting for people who
     don’t need it if they are not able to turn it off.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>While some multimedia players exist that allow the user to
     enable or disable an audio description channel as needed, this is not
     common and the most popular multimedia players, such as the YouTube
     player, do not include audio description options. For these players, the
     main video will need to include audio description or two versions of the
     video will need to be maintained: an audio-described version and a regular
     version.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Audio description can be the most difficult and expensive alternative
     means of access to implement, depending on the complexity of the video.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to Create Audio Description</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>When you’re thinking about audio description, you’ll need to
do a bit of planning. You’ll need to take the original multimedia and make a
note of all the action that takes place on screen. You’ll then need to work out
where the gaps between dialogue and sound effects occur, and how long they
last.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With that information, you’ll be able to write an audio
description script. This is something of an art form, because you need to
balance the right amount of description with the spaces you have in the
original soundtrack. With all this in mind, you might want to think about
getting a professional company to record the alternate soundtrack for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One way to avoid the need for audio description is to make
sure all visual information is naturally described audibly. For example, for a
video of an instructor’s PowerPoint presentation, if the presenter describes
her slides as a part of the presentation, there will be no need to create an
audio description track. As another example, if your video includes a quote
displayed on the screen, have a narrator read the quote aloud. In effect, the
narration is audio description, but rather than seeming like an after-the-fact
accessibility solution, the narration will be a natural part of the video. Of
course, for some types of video, simple narration is inadequate, and real audio
description should be provided.</p>

<h4>Audio Description: Tips for Going “Above and Beyond”</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>In instances where it is impossible to sufficiently describe
visual content in the gaps in the existing soundtrack, you may consider an
extended audio description. For an extended audio description, the video is
paused to allow the describer time to give a more detailed description. When
the description is finished, the video resumes playing. To successfully
implement this alternative means of access, you will need to publish two
versions of the video: the regular version and the audio-described version. However,
if you implement the “Above and Beyond” tip for creating a complex text version
of the video to replace a simple transcript, your text version meets the need for
an extended audio description, as long as all of the visual and auditory
information is included in that text version. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc382293749">Special Multimedia Issues for Consideration</a></h2>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293750">Multimedia Size &amp; Resolution</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Flexibility is an overlooked but important aspect of multimedia
accessibility. Flexibility includes the consideration of bandwidth, multimedia size,
resolution and device size (for example, smart phone, tablet, or desktop) in
the creation and delivery of your video. Some streaming services limit the
physical size of the multimedia file (for example, 500 MB). Size and bandwidth
go together. Who is your audience and how will they be accessing the material –
with a high speed urban Internet connection or a slower rural Internet
connection? Make sure your multimedia service provides for variable speed
streaming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You also want your users to be able to see a video across a
variety of resolutions. If there is text in the video, it must be readable both
on small screens and when the video is scaled to a full screen desktop monitor.
Therefore, you want to present your multimedia in the highest resolution
allowed by your constraints of original resolution, upload size, etc. The same
is true for sign language in a video. The video must be of sufficient
resolution for the sign to still be readable when the video is viewed full
screen on a desktop monitor. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293751">Web Conferences and Other Live Video Streams</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>In determining accessibility requirements for live video
streams, there are two relevant event categories, which this document will
refer to as “public” and “private.” Public events do not provide a method for
audience members to register in advance of the event. For example, the video
feed of a live speech by the Executive Director on the agency’s public website
or a live webinar linked from the agency’s internal Intranet site might both
qualify as public in that there is no way to know before the event what
accessibility needs your audience might have. Private events allow audience
members to register for the Web conference or video stream and make requests
for accommodation far enough in advance of the event that alternative means of
access can be arranged. For these private events, it could still be an option
for people to participate without having registered in advance or to register the
day of the event, but all potential audience members should receive notice of
the event with enough time to register and request an accommodation. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Public live video streams must have captions made available
through Communication Access Real Time Translation Services (CART) or
“picture-in-picture” video feed of someone translating the dialog into American
Sign Language. CART services involve a professional stenographer transcribing in
real-time the dialog and other relevant information (such as the speaker’s
name) using software that adds the captions to the video stream. Most Web-conferencing
and live video-streaming tools allow for a captions module to be included and
the CART transcriptionists tool would stream directly to the caption module. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because CART services and ASL interpreter services represent
an additional cost, there is no requirement to provide these services for
private events unless requested. This is true even if the webinar is free and
publicly-available as long as advance registration is allowed and attendees are
informed about the importance of registering. In this case, the registration
form should include a way for users to request special accommodation and a
reasonable deadline for making the request. You would need to be prepared to
offer CART or ASL services only for requests made by the deadline. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As mentioned in the section on audio description, audio
description is not required for live video streams, but presenters should still
make a point to narrate any presentation slides they have and to ensure that
they are communicating all other visual information audibly. Presenters also should
be prepared to offer accessible electronic versions of their PowerPoint slides
and any other handouts, as the Web conference tools often do not display the
presentation in a format that is accessible to screen reader users. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293752">Archiving Web Conferences</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>While audio description is not required for live video
streams, it may be required when those videos are archived for later viewing.
Additionally, while no alternative means of access may be required for Web
conferences unless accommodation is requested, it is important that the
archived version be captioned and accessible electronic versions of any
handouts be provided. Also, since CART transcriptions are generated very
quickly, there are likely to be errors, and it’s a good idea to edit your
transcripts before archiving if you used CART services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It may be a good idea to consider whether the archived Web
conference is the best format to communicate the information from the webinar. If
the goal is simply to archive the Web conference exactly as it happened,
including audience Q&amp;A (if applicable), then an archival version is
appropriate. However, Web conferencing tools are complex interfaces that are
often inaccessible or (if accessible) cumbersome to use, especially for people
with disabilities. Depending on the content, it may be more useful to create a
simple captioned and audio-described (if needed) video, or you may want to
create a text-based version of the content in the form of a PDF document or Web
page. In rare cases, it may be appropriate to publish the presenter’s
PowerPoint instead of the full Web conference, though the presenter probably
did not create the PowerPoint intending for it to stand alone, and this
approach requires that the end user have PowerPoint installed on their
computer.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293753">Use of Video at Live Events</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like live Web conferences, it may not be necessary to
provide captions or other alternative means of access for videos shown to a
live audience unless requested in advance. However, many of the benefits of
captions listed above are particularly applicable to a live audience: the
screen may be difficult to see in a large room or the audience may have
difficulty hearing the audio, so captioned and audio-described videos are a
good idea at all live events whether requested or not.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293754">Screencasts</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Screencasts, or screen capture videos, are instructional
videos that show the presenter’s screen while a task is performed. For videos
like these, the presenter or narrator must be sure to describe exactly what is
happening on the screen as the task is performed. This is important for people
who are blind, but because it is often easy for the non-blind audience to lose
track of what the presenter is doing in the screencast, detailed narration
makes the multimedia more useful to everyone. When possible, it’s a good idea
to announce keyboard shortcuts even when the task is being performed using the
mouse. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, in a screencast demonstration on saving
documents in Microsoft Office 2007, the narrator might say, “I’m going to click
on File and then click the top button, which says ‘Save.’ Another way to save a
document is to press Control + S on your keyboard.” In some cases, the way that
a JAWS user and other keyboard-only users would navigate a program is so
completely different that it may be helpful to create two versions of your
training: a regular version and a version for JAWS users, though this is a way
to go “above and beyond,” not an accessibility requirement.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293755">Recorded Lectures (“Talking Head” Videos)</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Because recorded lectures are probably not scripted and may
often be quite long, they can present the greatest challenge for transcribing
and captioning; these are the videos that are most likely to need professional
transcription services, because listening to the lecture and writing down the
content is a very time-consuming task for most people. Of course, the
non-accessibility benefits to transcripts and captions as described above (the
ability to skim a transcript or read it at your own pace, the option to search
a video’s captions and jump directly to the point in the video when the
searched phrase is spoken, etc.) are especially useful in long lecture videos.
While captioning lectures can be challenging, the potential need for audio
description is much lower, because there is less likely to be relevant visual
information beyond the spoken content. The best way to make sure that audio
description of a recorded lecture is unnecessary is to train lecturers to
describe their PowerPoint for the audience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One type of “talking head” video is the announcement video,
such as a monthly update by an agency commissioner. Unlike the recorded
lecture, these announcements are probably scripted, so captioning should be as
easy as adding timing information to the script. However, announcement videos
may have a very short turnaround time and little opportunity to plan
accessibility. Including accessibility from the beginning of the planning
process should help avoid any unwanted surprises while under a deadline.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293756">Choosing a Multimedia Player</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most modern Web-based multimedia players use either Flash or
HTML5 technology to display video. Flash in particular can be problematic for
accessibility, but it also creates issues for mobile users since the technology
does not work on many mobile devices. Additionally, because of how Flash works,
it is possible in some browsers for keyboard focus to get stuck in a Flash
video, and keyboard users are unable to navigate the rest of the page. It’s
important to use a multimedia player that uses HTML5 with Flash as a fallback,
like the YouTube player among others. It’s also important that the multimedia player
include controls that are accurately labeled for the screen reader and can be
manipulated using just the keyboard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another common method for providing videos to an audience is
to make the multimedia available for download, rather than streaming the multimedia
on the Web page. Downloaded videos will be played in whatever media player the
user selects. For Windows users, videos will open by default in Windows Media
Player. Because Windows Media Player uses a different method for displaying
closed captions than Web-based players or other media players, you should
consider posting your videos in the Windows Media format (.wmv) using Microsoft's
Synchronized Accessible Media Interchange (SAMI) for displaying captions. A
tutorial on this is available through WebAIM, listed in the Resources section
below.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc382293757">Standards &amp; Legal Requirements</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the benefits and challenges discussed in earlier
sections may be enough reason to take multimedia accessibility seriously, it
also is important to be familiar with the federal and state laws and rules that
relate to multimedia accessibility and the standards for accessible content.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Relevant laws, rules and standards include:</p>

Electronic and Information Resources (EIR) Accessibility Policy</a></p>

<p class=MsoListBullet style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>Current Texas
rules on accessibility for electronic and information resources including
multimedia content mirror the current federal Section 508 standards with one
exception regarding video.  A Section 508 refresh is in progress, however, and
Texas rules will be revised after Section 508 is updated.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Based on the outcomes of the refresh process to date,
accessibility experts expect that the updated Section 508 will align with the
current international standard, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0
(WCAG).  It makes sense, therefore, to begin complying with WCAG now.  WCAG 2.0
Level AA is the recommended standard for state agencies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each Texas state agency and institution of higher education
has its own accessibility policy and accessibility compliance or remediation
plan.  Be sure to check your organization’s specific requirements detailed in
the accessibility policy and plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Though much of the conversation about multimedia accessibility
refers to multimedia published via the Web since that’s common, multimedia accessibility
requirements apply regardless of the delivery medium—whether that’s an Internet
or Intranet site, a LAN file, or a DVD/CD, and whether the audience is external
or internal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The sections below highlight the multimedia aspects of the
referenced laws and rules (not all elements).  It’s important to note that
there may be a difference between achieving minimum legal compliance and providing
content that is actually fully accessible and usable for its intended audience.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293758">Texas Gov. Code Chapter 2054, TAC 206, TAC 213</a></h3>

TAC, Chapter 213, Subchapter B</a>)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Texas accessibility rules require state agencies to
comply with the Section 508 standards for all <a
href="http://www2.dir.state.tx.us/SitePolicies/Pages/accessibilitypolicy.aspx">electronic
information resources (EIR)</a> developed, procured, or significantly modified
after September 1, 2006, with one difference regarding video. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>TAC 206, which addresses accessibility of websites, says
that state agency websites must comply with “the standards described in Section
508 Subpart B §1194.22, paragraphs (a) through (p), excluding paragraphs (b)
and (k).” Related to this discussion of video, the excluded paragraph (b) of
Section 508 is the section requiring that equivalent alternatives must be
synchronized with the presentation. TAC 206 goes on to explain that, while an alternative
means of access must be provided on request to make multimedia information
available to people with disabilities, that alternative format does not need to
be synchronized. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The take-away is that current Texas rules specifically
suggest captions and audio descriptions as accessible options, but text-only
transcripts of videos also are permitted. Therefore, state agencies that
provide transcripts as an equivalent alternative for multimedia or other
multimedia will not be in compliance with the Section 508 standard, but will be
in compliance with current Texas law. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note: TAC 213, which addresses accessibility of electronic
and information resources in addition to websites, is scheduled for revision by
DIR and will be modified following the in-progress Section 508 refresh to align
with WCAG 2.0 (discussed below).  So any decisions about acceptable alternative
means of access should be informed by the following information on WCAG 2.0.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293759">Section 508</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Note: The 15-year old Section 508 is currently undergoing a
refresh to align with WCAG 2.0 AA, which will better reflect modern use of
technology. This update is discussed in the WCAG 2.0 AA section below. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?fuseAction=1998Amend">Section 508 of
the U.S. Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended in 1998</a> (Section 508) is
the federal standard that provides, among other things, specific guidelines on how
to create accessible Web pages and multimedia. </p>

<h4>1194.22 (b) - Multimedia</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Section 508 provides clear instructions on how to deal with
videos. According to <a
href="http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm#(b)">paragraph (b)
of Section 1194.22</a>, “Equivalent alternatives for any multimedia
presentation shall be synchronized with the presentation.”  In simple terms,
this means that captions and audio description (explained in earlier sections)
are required for videos to be in compliance with Section 508. Transcripts, for
example, do not comply with the guideline because they are not an equivalent
alternative if not synchronized with the presentation. </p>

<h4>1194.22 (m) – Plug-ins</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>An additional Section 508 standard provides guidance on the multimedia
player used to display the video. The most commonly-used players, such as the multimedia
player on YouTube Web pages, uses a technology called Flash, which must be
installed on the user’s computer. <a
href="http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/guide/1194.22.htm#(m)">Paragraph (m)
of Section 1194.22</a> says, “When a Web page requires that an applet, plug-in
or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content,
the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with
§1194.21(a) through (l).”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This means that the multimedia player (Flash, Quicktime,
Windows Media Player, or any other technology) must be navigable to a person
using screen reading software. Some multimedia players pass this requirement
but others do not, so you will need to do some research to find the best option
and possibly attempt to interact with the player using just the keyboard and a
screen reader. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293760">WCAG 2.0 AA</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/glance/">Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> are another important and relevant
accessibility standard for consideration.  Developed by the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), the main international standards organization for the World
Wide Web, WCAG 2.0 is the primary accessibility standard used globally and by
private industry in the United States, making it a useful standard for
reference.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although current state law does not require us to comply
with WCAG standards, we are moving in that direction so complying now will give
us a head start on necessary changes.  In the near future, it is expected
(based on a <a href="http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/refresh/notice.htm">2011
draft of Section 508</a> published in the Federal Register and other
communication from the Access Board) that Section 508 will be updated to be
more in line with WCAG 2.0, specifically compliance level AA of WCAG. State
accessibility rules will be revised by DIR once the Section 508 refresh is
complete.  Web pages and products that comply with WCAG 2.0 AA will be in
compliance with the updated Section 508 when it goes into effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#media-equiv">WCAG 2.0 AA
Guideline 1.2</a> requires alternatives for time-based media, including
captions for pre-recorded and live audio in synchronized media. The guideline
also suggests several optional or “nice-to-have” accessibility features, which
are listed as the AAA compliance level, such as sign language interpretation
and additional formats for the content. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When Section 508 is updated to be in line with WCAG 2.0 AA,
DIR will need to update the TAC rules accordingly. Rule revision is a lengthy
process; it likely will take six months or longer for the TAC update. However,
some discussion has already occurred suggesting that, in light of technological
advancements, Texas rules will fall more in line with other accessibility
requirements by requiring captions and other synchronized alternatives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The take-away is that voluntary compliance with WCAG 2.0
compliance level AA, the more-widely accepted standard--including captions for
video, is the safest bet for ensuring that videos are both completely
accessible and will be compliant with Section 508 and TAC rules once the update
process is complete.</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc382293761">21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility
Act</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Effective September 30, 2012, Federal Communication
Commission regulations mandated by the 2010 <a
href="http://www.fcc.gov/guides/21st-century-communications-and-video-accessibility-act-2010">21st
Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act </a>require that all video
delivered online must be captioned if it was shown on television with captions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The take-away is that any content posted anywhere online by
the agency or anyone else that previously aired on television with captioning,
such as a commercial or public service announcement, must be captioned.</p>
