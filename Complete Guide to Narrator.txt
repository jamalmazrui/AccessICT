Other capabilities that are new to Narrator over the last few releases 
Email improvements in Outlook and Windows Mail 
Use Scan Mode to read emails 
Scan Mode turns on automatically when you open an email. Use the arrow keys and other Scan Mode commands-just like you would on the web-to navigate around. 
Emails are read automatically 
When you open an email, Narrator will start reading-no commands required. 
Get the important info, skip the noise 
In Outlook, Narrator will read an email's status (unread, forwarded, etc.), who sent it, the subject line, and any other characteristics of the email that are important or unique (for example, Narrator will read if an email is flagged, but it won't read if an email is unflagged). 
Narrator won't read any unnecessary table info, like if there are 5 empty columns, and column headers won't be read by default. Turn column header reading in Outlook on or off by pressing Narrator + H. 
Web improvements 
No more unhelpful hyperlinks 
Narrator will give you the title of the webpage for a link. Press Narrator + Ctrl + D, and Narrator will take the URL of the hyperlink you are on and send it to an online service that will provide the page title to Narrator. And when focus is on an image, the Narrator + Ctrl + D command provides a description of the image. If you would like to disable all online services used by Narrator, you can turn this feature off in Narrator settings. 
Get a quick summary of a webpage 
Hear a webpage summary that includes the number of links, landmarks, and headings by pressing Narrator + S. 
Popular links and full webpage summary 
Press Narrator + S twice quickly to pull up a dialog box on the screen with the following info: the number of links, landmarks, and headings on a page, and a list of popular links for a page (popular links are the links on the page that get the most engagement). 
Webpages are read automatically 
Narrator automatically reads webpages starting at the top of the page. 
Sound improvements 
New sounds for common actions 
Narrator sounds are now more functional and responsive. For example, sounds now play for common actions, such as when you land on a link or when you turn on or off Scan Mode. To manage sounds for common actions, go to Narrator settings. To hear the Narrator sounds, refer to Appendix E: Narrator Sounds. 
Hear capital letters and words 
By default, Narrator reads capital letters the same as lowercase ones. This means "Word," "WORD," and "word" all sound the same (even though different letters are capitalized in each). 
If you'd like to hear when a letter is capitalized, Narrator can say "cap" before it, or read the word or letter in a higher pitch. To change how Narrator handles capitalization, go to the section "Change what you hear when reading and interacting" in Narrator settings. 
Read with Magnifier 
Magnifier, the screen-magnifying feature that comes with Windows 11, will now read text aloud. This might be useful if you are a low vision user who would like text read aloud on-demand.  For more information, refer to Use Magnifier to make things on the screen easier to see. 
Narrator Home 
Every time you turn on Narrator, you'll go to Narrator Home, which gives you one place where you can find everything you need, from changing your Narrator settings to learning the basics of Narrator with QuickStart. Also, when minimized Narrator Home goes into your system tray, so you won't need to navigate around it when using Alt + Tab to switch between things. 
Read by sentence 
Narrator can now read next, current, and previous sentences. Read by sentence is available whenever you use a keyboard, touch, or braille. 
"Sentence" is also its own Narrator view. Press Narrator + Page up or Narrator + Page down to get to the sentence view, then press Narrator + Left arrow to move to the previous sentence and Narrator + Right arrow to move to the next sentence. 
You can use these new commands on Braille displays by pressing dots 2-3-4 or 2-3-4-7 in command input mode.  
New verbosity levels 
Narrator provides five verbosity levels that impact the amount of information you hear when Narrator reads text, such as web sites, and when you interact with controls. Each level is documented in Chapter 4 with a brief description of how you might want to use it. 
Use scan mode in your favorite browser 
Scan mode turns on automatically in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. 
Standard keyboard layout 
We wanted to make it easier for you to learn and use Narrator, so we've introduced a new Standard keyboard layout. The updated layout is more like the keyboard layout you may have experienced in other screen readers. 
When keyboard commands are mentioned in this guide, they're for the new standard keyboard layout. Some of the new commands include updates to Narrator's page, paragraph, line, word, and character commands. You'll also notice new commands like Narrator Find, list of links, list of headings, and list of landmarks. For some commands, you can now use the numeric keypad. 
You can explore all the new and updated commands in Appendix B: Narrator keyboard commands and touch gestures. Find scan mode commands in Chapter 3: Using scan mode. 
Note: Your keyboard will default to the Standard layout. If you want to change this, go 
to Settings  > Accessibility  > Narrator, and choose the Legacy layout. You can also get to your Narrator settings by pressing Windows logo key  + Ctrl + N. New Narrator commands will not be available in the Legacy keyboard layout if keystrokes for legacy commands conflict with those used in new Narrator features. 
Open Narrator settings 
Narrator key 
You can now choose what modifier key you want to use in Narrator commands. Both the Caps Lock and Insert keys serve as your Narrator key by default. You can use either of these keys in any command that uses the Narrator key. The Narrator key is referred to as simply "Narrator" in commands. You can change your Narrator key in Narrator settings. 
Updated Change View commands 
Change View commands are now mapped to the Narrator + Page up and Page down keys. You can also use Change View by pressing Narrator + Ctrl + Up arrow and Down arrow. 
Improvements to scan mode 
Scan mode's Primary and Secondary Action commands have changed. A Primary Action can be executed by pressing Enter or Spacebar. You can complete a Secondary Action by adding a Shift key to each of those keys (Shift + Enter or Shift + Spacebar). You'll notice this change regardless of the keyboard layout you select. 
Additionally, several new scan mode keyboard commands have been added that allow you to select text. You can learn more about them in Chapter 3: Using scan mode. 
 	 

Chapter 1: Introducing Narrator 
Narrator lets you use your PC without a mouse to complete common tasks if you're blind or have low vision. It reads and interacts with things on the screen, like text and buttons. Use Narrator to read and write email, browse the internet, and work with documents. 
Specific commands let you navigate Windows, the web, and apps. Navigation is available using headings, links, landmarks, and more. You can read text (including punctuation) by page, paragraph, line, sentence, word, and character, as well as determine characteristics like font and text color. Efficiently review tables with row and column navigation. 
Narrator also has a navigation and reading mode, which you'll learn more about in Chapter 3: Using scan mode. Use it to get around Windows 11 using just the up and down arrows on your keyboard. You can also use a braille display to navigate your PC and read text, which you'll learn more about in Chapter 8: Using Narrator with braille. 
You can also customize the speaking rate, pitch, and volume of the voice that Narrator uses, and install other text-to-speech voices. 
Narrator Home 
Every time you turn on Narrator you'll go to Narrator Home, which gives you one place where you can open everything you need, whether you want to change your Narrator settings or learn basics with QuickStart. The links at Narrator Home include QuickStart, Narrator guide (which takes you to this online user guide), What's New, Settings, and Feedback. You can also control whether Narrator Home opens when Narrator starts in Narrator settings or by using the checkbox on Narrator home.  
Two ways to start and stop Narrator 
* Press the Windows logo key  + Ctrl + Enter together to start Narrator. Press these keys again to stop Narrator. (On older versions of Windows, the command was the Windows logo key  + Enter.) On many keyboards, the Windows logo key is located on the bottom row of keys, to the left or right of the Alt key. 
* Press the Windows logo key  + Ctrl + N to open Narrator settings, and then turn on the toggle under Use Narrator. 
Note: When you're signing in or accessing some menus, the Accessibility icon will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen. Selecting the Accessibility icon opens a menu with a toggle switch that you can use to turn Narrator on or off. Narrator will turn off once you sign in or exit the screen. 
Start Narrator automatically before or after you sign in to your PC 
1. Press the Windows logo key  + Ctrl + N to open Narrator settings. 
2. To start Narrator automatically after you sign in, select the check box next to Start Narrator after sign-in for me. 
3. To start Narrator automatically before sign-in for all users, select the check box next to Start Narrator before sign-in for everyone. 
 	 

Chapter 2: Narrator basics 
This chapter explains Narrator keyboard navigation. This includes how to get around the screen, find and open apps, and change what Narrator reads. It also explains the basic details of adjusting Narrator speech rate, volume, and how to stop speech. 
Scan mode gives you even more navigation options. We'll cover that in Chapter 3: Using scan mode. 
Learn Narrator with QuickStart  
QuickStart is a tutorial that'll guide you through the basics of using Narrator. It shows you how to do things like navigate headings and landmarks, and there's even a sample webpage to help you get comfortable with using Narrator online. Get to QuickStart anytime from Narrator Home, which launches by default when you turn on Narrator.  
Tab, arrow, and Enter keys  
In Windows, use the Tab or arrow keys to move around apps and webpages. When you get to something you want to use, like a link, press Enter. You can also use the Tab, arrow, and Enter keys to move between and interact with things like check boxes and buttons.  
Narrator key  
You can choose what modifier key you want to use in Narrator commands. Both the Caps lock and Insert keys serve as your Narrator key by default. You can use either of these keys in any command that uses the Narrator key. The Narrator key is referred to as simply "Narrator" in commands. You can change your Narrator key in Narrator settings. 
Note: If you're using a Japanese 106 keyboard, Insert and NonConvert are your default Narrator keys.  
Explore your keyboard  
Input learning tells you what keys you're pressing on your keyboard, and the Narrator command associated with them. Turn input learning on or off by pressing Narrator + 1 (the number 1 key).   
Stop Narrator from reading  
To stop Narrator from reading at any time, press the Ctrl key.  
Make Narrator speak louder or faster  
To change Narrator volume  
* Press Narrator + Ctrl + Plus sign (+) or Narrator + Ctrl + Add (numeric keypad) to increase volume 
* Press Narrator + Ctrl + Minus sign (-) or Narrator + Ctrl + Subtract (numeric keypad) to decrease volume 
To change the rate at which Narrator speaks  
	▪ 	Press Narrator + Plus sign (+) or Narrator + Minus sign (-). 
Note: The commands that include plus (+) and minus (-) refer to the physical key and don't require Shift as a modifier. Unless explicitly called out, it isn't necessary to include Shift before the equal key to make it the plus sign as you would when typing the plus sign. Using the Narrator volume command above as an example, Narrator + Ctrl + equal (=) is the literal command, not Narrator + Ctrl + Shift + equal (=).   
Windows keyboard shortcuts  
Windows and Windows apps have keyboard shortcuts that you can use alongside Narrator commands. For example, press the Windows logo key to open the Start menu, or, to open action center, press the Windows logo key + A.  
For a list of the keyboard shortcuts you can use in Windows, refer to Keyboard shortcuts in Windows. For a list of keyboard shortcuts in Windows apps, refer to Keyboard shortcuts in apps. For a list of keyboard shortcuts in other Windows assistive technologies, refer to Windows keyboard shortcuts for accessibility.  
Get around apps and webpages  
Find and open apps  
To quickly find an app in Windows 11, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard to open the Start menu and place focus in the search box. Then, type the name of the app that you're looking for, use the arrow keys to select it in the list of search results, and press the Enter key to open it.  
Switch between apps  
To switch between open apps on your PC, hold down the Alt key and then press the Tab key. Narrator will speak the name of open apps as you cycle through them. When you find the app that you want to use, release both keys.  
Anytime you want to know which app or Window has focus, press Narrator + T to read the title of the window that has focus. To read the title and contents of the window that has focus, press Narrator + W.

Chapter 4: Reading text 
This chapter explains a few ways you can start reading text with Narrator. You can also get detail on the formatting of the text you're reading.  
 
The first and simplest way to read with Narrator is to use the arrow keys to navigate text if you're interacting with a document in a word processor, such as Microsoft Word.  
 
You can also use scan mode to read text. To turn on scan mode, press Narrator + Spacebar. Then use the up and down arrow keys to read by paragraph and the left and right arrow keys to read by character. To learn more about scan mode, go to Chapter 3: Using scan mode.  
 
When you want more control over what text you read, Narrator provides a series of text-reading commands to help navigate and read text. Below are some basics to get you started. To view all reading commands, go to Appendix B: Narrator keyboard commands and touch gestures.  
 
• To stop reading, press Ctrl. 
• To read the window title, press Narrator + T. 
• To read a window, press Narrator + W. 
 
Tip: When reading a web page or an email, Narrator commands will apply to the content of the page or email and not to the browser or application. To navigate out of the content, just press the Tab key or use an application shortcut.

Get more details about text  
Narrator provides different levels of detail about controls and the characteristics of text, known as verbosity. To change the level of verbosity, press Narrator + V or Narrator + Shift + V until you hear the level of detail that you want.  
 
• Verbosity level 1: Text only 
This level lets you read quickly without hearing details about text that you don't need to know. For example, Narrator doesn't announce links, doesn't describe text formatting, and lets you work very quickly with an application that you know well. This level provides an ideal experience as you read text-heavy articles, books, and web sites. 
 
• Verbosity level 2: Some control details 
This level provides more information than level 1 does as you interact with an application. It's best if you're familiar with an application and only need guidance with some controls. 
 
• Verbosity level 3: All control details  
This is the default level for Narrator. It provides a full reading experience along with all details about an application's controls as you interact with them. 
 
• Verbosity level 4: Some text details  
This level provides most attributes and information about text. It's best in situations when you're writing text, such as when you create a document. 
 
• Verbosity level 5: All text details 
This level gives you complete details about text, such as heading level, font type, size, formatting, bullet shape, list type, and more. It's especially useful when you proofread or edit a document. 
 
Get details on formatting  
Narrator provides details about formatting, such as font name, font size, and text alignment. To hear formatting attributes, press Narrator + F. To hear the next group of formatting attributes, press Narrator + F again. To hear the previous group of formatting attributes, press Narrator + Shift + F.  
 
Formatting information is separated into the following groups:  
• Font information. Font name, weight, size, italic, underline, underline color, strikethrough, background color, foreground color. 
• Advanced font information. Hyperlink, style, bullet style, subscript, superscript, capitalization style, outline style, overline color, language. 
• Object color and outline information. Fill type (none, color, gradient, picture, or pattern), fill color, outline color, outline thickness. 
• Paragraph spacing Information. Line spacing, before paragraph spacing, after paragraph spacing. 
• Page margin information. Top margin, bottom margin, leading margin, trailing margin. 
• Alignment information. Horizontal text alignment, text flow direction, indentation first line, indentation leading, indentation trailing. 
• Visual effects information. Animation style, visual effects (reflection, glow, soft edges, and bevel). 
• Object layout information. Center point, size, rotation. 
• Annotation information. Annotations such as spelling and grammar suggestions and comments. 
 
Hear punctuation  
Narrator gives you control over how much punctuation you hear when reading text. To change how punctuation is read out, press:  
 
• Narrator + Alt + Subtract (numeric keypad) 
• Narrator + Alt + Minus sign (-) 
• Narrator + Alt + Add (numeric keypad) 
• Narrator + Alt + Plus sign (+) 
 
You can select from the following levels of description:  
 
• Default. Hear little to no punctuation. Natural pauses will indicate items such as commas and periods. 
• Math. Hear most mathematical symbols. 
• Some. Hear most conversational punctuation, such as commas and periods. 
• Most. Hear additional symbols, such as parentheses. 
• All. Hear all punctuation, including all special symbols. 
 
Hear capital letters and words  
By default, Narrator reads capital letters the same as lowercase ones. This means "Word," "WORD," and "word" all sound the same (even though different letters are capitalized in each).   
 
If you'd like to hear when a letter is capitalized, Narrator can say "cap" before it, or read the word or letter in a higher pitch. To change how Narrator handles capitalization, in Narrator settings, go to Change how capitalized text is read under the section Change what you hear when reading and interacting. 
 
Read text in other languages  
When reading text in a different language, Narrator will automatically select the text-to-speech (TTS) voice for that language if it's installed. To learn more about installing additional TTS voices, go to Appendix A: Supported languages and voices.  
 
If the TTS voice for a language isn't installed, Narrator will state the name of the language and read the text using the default TTS voice. 
 	 
Chapter 5: Navigation 
Narrator views 
The different views in Narrator include items, characters, words, sentences, lines, paragraphs , headings, links, form fields, tables, landmarks, and suggestions. To change views, you can use the following commands: 
* Narrator + Page up and Narrator + Page down 
* Narrator + Ctrl + Up arrow key and Narrator + Ctrl + Down arrow key 
To navigate by the view that you've selected, press Narrator + Left arrow key or Narrator + Right arrow key. 
Tip: Views are especially useful when you're navigating by touch. Learn more about using touch with Narrator in Chapter 6: Using Narrator with touch.

Appendix E: Narrator sounds 
To reduce how often you hear Narrator make common announcements, like when you've made a typo or turned off scan mode, some announcements can be replaced with only a sound. The table below lists the names of the sounds, a description of when you'd hear them, and an option to play the sound. When you select Play sound, a new tab will open, and the sound will play.   
The common announcements that can be replaced with only sound are when something is autocorrected, when you land on a link, when scan mode is turned on or off, when there is a spelling error, and when suggestions are available.  
To replace those announcements with only the sounds, go to Narrator settings by pressing the Windows logo key + Ctrl + N, go to the section Change what you hear when reading and interacting, and select the checkbox next to Hear only sounds for common actions. 
Note: In Windows 11, dark and light mode have different soundscapes; try them both to see which you prefer.
