Using This Book

[]

First, a brief introduction to using this resource.

[]

On each page, pressing Tab once moves focus to the Skip to content link. Selecting the link moves keyboard focus directly to the beginning of the page’s main content.

[]

At the bottom of each page are the next and previous buttons. Use these buttons to move between pages and chapters:

[]

You can also use the left and right arrow keyboard keys to move between pages.

Near the top left of each page is a table of contents. The Contents button expands the table of contents menu allowing you to navigate between pages and chapters:

[]

Most pages contain an “On This Page” section with links to specific parts of each page, such as:

[]

Select a link to skip to that part of the page.

Pages that do not have a table of contents are short or only cover one major topic.

As you move down the page, a Back to top button appears at the bottom of the screen:

[]

Select the Back to top button to move back to the top of the page.

[]

Glossary items appear in bold, red text with a dotted underline, such as in this example:

[]

DIGITAL ACCESSIBILITY

8  |  Digital Accessibility

Digital Accessibility

Digital technology is so ubiquitous that it is difficult to think of many activities that don’t rely on digital technology of some kind. We may often take for granted that things just ‘work.’ What if something you used everyday didn’t work? What if you couldn’t read your email? What if you couldn’t log in to your online banking? What if your key card didn’t let you into your building?

For many people, every day they encounter something that doesn’t work for them. A PDF that cannot be read aloud may not effect you, but for some that inaccessible PDF might as well be blank. A form that says ‘fill out the forms marked with red text’ may make sense to you, but many people would not be able to decipher which fields to complete. Digital accessibility moves toward ensuring everyone can access content; that everything works.

Accessible content is not a special accommodation for small groups or individuals. Accessible content is designed for a universal audience.

[]

[]

This is achieved because accessible content accounts for a diversity of access means.

[]Consider that 96% of disabilities are “invisible”, that is to say they are not outwardly visible to the casual observer.¹ There is no way to say who accesses content in what way by looking at them. Further, statistics suggest only one-third of college students with a disability disclose their status to their school.² Additionally, 94% of high school students with disabilities get some form of assistance, while that number drops to 17% at the college level.³

Educators cannot rely on accommodation requests, or lack thereof, to decide when to make accessible content. Accessible content is built for everyone and reduces the need to

2.  NCES, "A Majority of College Students with Disabilities Do Not Inform School, New NCES Data Show"

3.  Yale, "Disability at Yale"

accommodate specific cases, increases the usability of content, and maximizes the independence of all users.

[]

So, how do you make something digitally accessible?

Take a moment to consider who ramps are built for.

[]

[]

Many people might answer “wheelchair users”. That is correct. Ramps are purpose-built to assist movement. They are essential for someone using a wheelchair to navigate and access parts of the physical world. However, most people can also use ramps. What is essential for some also benefits others.

[]

[]

Traditionally, one might think of creating accessible content as an accommodation essential for some users; but like ramps, these elements benefit everyone.

[]

With a better understanding of digital accessibility you can create accessible content and choose accessible resources. Keep in mind, digital accessibility is not pass/fail; material may be more or less accessible than previous versions or alternate formats. Aim to provide the most accessible version of content to deliver the same information to everyone at the same time.

[] Maximizing             accessibility allows for democratic, just,

equitable, and inclusive access. Accessibility:

•    Minimizes othering

•    Allows maximum independence

•    Increases audience size

•    Aids comprehension

•    Meaningfully includes the greatest number of people

•    Requires less work than accommodation

•    Makes content easier to share and remix

By adopting the best practices and consulting the resources found in this guide, you will learn how to choose and create accessible content efficiently and effectively.

A final note: focus on creation and revision, not remediation. When you create new content or update existing material, focus on incorporating accessibility best practices. Do not focus on all your existing documents and worry about ‘fixing’ each one. Aim to improve as you move forward.

Accessibility Essentials

For initial, immediate accessibility checks, ensure content has:

A descriptive title 

1. Slide decks, documents, webpages, and videos need descriptive titles.

 

Layout and structure 

1. Use built-in tools for:

1.      Headings

2.      Lists

3.      Tables

Sufficient contrast 

1.      Use dark text on light backgrounds and light text on dark backgrounds.

2.      Prefer sans-serif fonts for readability.

Descriptive link text 

1.      Type a description of the link destination and then add a hyperlink to that text.

Accessibility Essentials

2.      Do not include bare URLs.

Text equivalents for images (alt text), videos (closed captio (transcripts) 

1.      Briefly describe the information an image presents.

2.      Use Kaltura or OneDrive to generate captions and edit for accuracy.

3.      Use Word to transcribe audio files.

Been evaluated by an accessibility checker

This resource is meant to be used as a reference, not something to be memorized. Bookmark this Pressbook to use as a guide as you make content.

Accessibility FAST

Function

[]

In assessing the function of content, the basic question is: “does it work?” Functional content:

•    Conveys information effectively

•    Works on different devices and with software using different settings

•    Does not automatically play, move, or close

This is important for users of assistive technology to ensure they can consume and interact with your content. This also benefits all users, allowing them choice in accessing material.

[]

A first step to conveying information effectively is to write using plain language. Plain language is especially helpful for readers with cognitive disabilities, but all readers benefit from clear content.

Plain language helps readers:

1.      Find what they need.

2.      Understand what they find.

3.      Use what they find.

A Stanford study found that people often make their writing “more complex in order to appear smarter”, but “research shows that such strategies tend to backfire.”¹

Plain Language Best Practices 

Write for the intended audience:

•    Accessibility guidelines suggest a 9th grade reading level for general content.

◦ Academic and technical writing will likely exceed that level.

•    Check your Word document’s readability or paste your content into the Readability Analyzer for statistics.

•    Don’t assume knowledge. Introduce and explain concepts and technical terms early.

•    Explain acronyms and abbreviations.

Use clear language:

•    Aim for an average sentence length of 20-25 words.

•    Avoid long words when possible.

1. Daniel M. Oppenheimer "Consequences of erudite vernacular utilized irrespective of necessity: problems with using long words needlessly"

Function

•    Avoid idioms and figures of speech.

•    Use active verbs and personal pronouns.

•    Use contractions.

Group content:

•    Publish as much content as possible in one document or webpage.

•    Avoid sending readers to additional resources or downloading multiple formats to obtain essential information.

Consider the Plain Language Action guide and try using simple words and phrases.

[]

In digital accessibility, robustness refers to the strength of the code. When creating something, ensure your content works:

•    By testing on multiple devices and browsers

◦ Zoom in to 200% in a web browser to test that your content is adaptive, responsive, and can reflow

▪ EPUB and Word will reflow by default.

▪ Web content can be be made to be responsive with relative ease.

▪ PDF requires significant work to make accessible and generally do not reflow properly (by design).

•    By pressing Tab to verify reading order and focus states to ensure links and buttons can be reached by keyboard alone.

◦ Also use Tab to check that table content is read in the correct sequence.

Ensuring your content is robust allows users to customize their experience and use on their chosen device.

Multiple Formats 

Another best practice is to provide content in multiple formats. Robust content can be converted between formats with little to no loss of function or formatting.

Choose the best format based on content:

•    Use HTML (Brightspace, WordPress) whenever possible.

◦ HTML has many accessibility features.

•    Word documents for short documents.

◦ Word documents can easily be locked to restrict editing.

•    EPUB for longer documents like manuals or books.

•    MS Forms or PDF for fillable forms.

◦ Use PDFs only when necessary as they are exceedingly difficult to make accessible.

•    PPTX for presentations.

[]

Include captioned media in accessible players. Media players must be able to be operated by keyboard alone.

Ensure audio and video do not autoplay; for carousels or slideshows, provide an option to pause. If media autoplays, many users will have difficulty pausing. The inability to pause

Function

media will interfere with many types of assistive technology and be a distraction to most users, regardless of access means.

Ensure no content flashes more than 3 times per second as it could cause seizures.

Appearance

[]

How content appears is an important influence on the accessibility of your content. Consider:

•    Font choices

•    Effective hyperlinks

•    Use of colour

•    How content appears on different devices

Accessible appearance helps those with vision impairments, cognitive disabilities, colour blindness, or printing content in black and white. However, like many accessible design practices, following these best practices will benefit everyone.

[]

Text content needs to be readable. For people with low-vision or dyslexia, good font choices can make content easier to read. Consider the following passage:

choices have a great impact on people with dyslexia. Better practices include:

•    Prefer sans-serif and basic serifs.

◦ Avoid decorative fonts with elaborate serifs.

•    Left-align text for languages that read left to right.

◦ Avoid justified alignment.

•    Consider spacing.

◦ Line height or line spacing must be at least 1.5 times the font size.

◦ Spacing after a paragraph must be at least 2 times the font size.

◦ Letter spacing must be at least 0.12 times the font size. ◦ Word spacing must be at least 0.16 times the font size.

•    Avoid excessive use of italics.

•    Avoid long blocks of all capitals.

•    Do not use images of text.

Font choices are part of good design and make content easier to read for everyone.

A simple test for your font choices is the Il1 test. When choosing a font type a capital i, a lowercase l, and the number 1 beside each other with no spaces.² A good font will have obvious distinction between those characters. This helps avoid character ambiguity which may cause confusion for readers. Consider these examples:

          Poor (Alata)                    (Roboto)                            Sans)

2.  Admitedly, the default font of Pressbooks is not an excellent example of best practice.

Appearance

This is not the only factor to choosing the right font, but is an easy test of how legible your font is.

[]

Text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against the background colour.

For example, black on white is 21:1 and orange on white is

3.37:1.

Additionally, do not use colour alone to emphasize content.

These best practices are essential for readers that are colour blind, but benefit users with screen glare, custom contrast settings, or other vision impairments.

The next chapter examines colour in further detail.

Appearance

Accessible Colour

[]

Colour contrast is a key element of accessibility. 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women have some kind of colour vision deficiency.¹ It is essential to ensure foreground information has sufficient contrast against background colours and that colour is not the only means to convey or emphasize information.

Consider that good colour colour contrast practices aren’t just for those who see colour differently. Better practices are

1. Colour Blind Awareness, "About Colour Blindness"

[]

[]

Digital colours are specified using colour codes. The most common colour codes are Hexadecimal (hex), RGB, and HSL. Each of these colour codes express colours using different values. Try entering a colour in this Color Converter tool to see how colours can be coded.

[]

Hex values are referred to in this guide, but the principles are applicable to any colour code system.

[]

For proper colour contrast, aim for at least a 4.5:1 ratio. To (over)simplify that ratio, that means the text is 4.5 times brighter than the background. For large text (size 18 point or greater) or bold 14 point or greater, requires only a 3:1 ratio to be accessible. Logos and decorative images have no colour requirements.

As an example of an accessible contrast ratio, black text on a white background has a ratio of 21:1. Orange text on a white background (or vice-versa) does not provide sufficient colour contrast with a ratio of 3.37:1.

[]

Further, don’t rely on colour alone to convey information or emphasize importance.

Add visual or text equivalents to colour, for example:

 

•    Use colour, shapes, and text in charts and diagrams.

•    Add text indicators to highlighted table cells.

•    Include reminders like “important” or “required” in addition to using bold or a specific font colour.

If you rely on colour alone, readers with colour vision deficiency, using screen readers or text to speech software, or those viewing in black and white will miss the meaning.

[]

There are many options for finding colour codes.

[]

Use these tools to find colour codes and contrast checking tools to verify accessible colour contrast.

Contrast Checkers 

WebAIM (Accessibility in Mind) is an exceptional resource that has a contrast checker (that can be added as a browser tool), a link contrast checker, and additional reading on colour contrast.

ACE (Accessibility Colour Evaluator) is an excellent tool for checking colour contrast. You can set multiple colours for multiple elements (background, text, link, hover, etc.) and see the corresponding colour contrast ratios.

Use a heading level 1 for the main topic or title. Use heading level 2 for primary sections and heading level 3 for subsections. Multiple subsequent heading levels can be nested under a higher level.

Do not skip a heading level.

Body text can follow any heading level.

Include style and code 

Headings are not just larger, bolded text. Using visual style for headings is a good way to set them apart, but headings must included coded meaning. Use built-in tools to create accessible headings.

 

 

Use headings in Word 

Use the Word Styles gallery to set headings.

Structure

[]

Well structured documents are essential to allow assistive technology               to             navigate your         documents.             Structured documents help all readers with context, organization of ideas, and clarity. Aim to keep the structure of content as consistent as possible.

To create accessible structure:

•    Use templates.

•    Use clear and consistent layouts across related documents.

•    Use built-in heading and style tools.

•    Use built-in list tools to create lists.

◦ Use bulleted lists for grouping items and numbered

Structure

lists for steps in a process.

•    Use page breaks, columns, and text spacing tools in place of creating space manually using the Spacebar, Tab, or Return keys.

•    Use built-in table tools.

◦ Designate header rows, header columns, or both.

◦ Avoid merged, split, and blank cells.

◦ Navigate table by pressing Tab key to verify logical reading order.

◦ Do not use tables as layout tools.

•    Avoid text boxes.

•    Check reading order in tools such as PowerPoint.

[]

Headings are an important part of documents and web pages. Headings           create      organizational         flow,        build        connections between key concepts, and break up large blocks of text to increase readability.

Use built-in tools to create headings in nested, sequential order. Proper headings are both visual and semantic (code for interpreting content). Simply making text larger and bold does not give headings essential meaning in code. Proper headings have both style and meaning.

Headings are

Text Equivalents

[]When creating something that isn’t text, add:

•    Descriptive link text for hyperlinks

•    Alternative text (alt text) to images and graphics

•    Table data to charts and figures

•    Captions to diagrams

•    Closed captions to videos

•    Transcripts to audio

Alt text is essential for screen reader users to understand the meaning of an image. Diagram captions and table data for charts act as text equivalents for those visual representations of data. Captions and transcripts are essential for deaf and hard of hearing viewers (but many people prefer to watch content with captions).

Do not include bare URLs 

However, provide email addresses as unlinked plain text, include short top-level URLs such as Langara.ca, or use link shorteners like bit.ly.

Include purpose and context 

Do not use “Click here” or “Read more” as links written this way do not include purpose, information, or context.

Write a concise and meaningful description 

Write a description of the link destination using informative and relevant words to communicate the link’s purpose.

Select the descriptive text and use built-in tools to insert a link. Click the appropriate link button in:

Accessible Links Quick Start Guide

Accessible Links

[]

Use descriptive hyperlink text that includes an informative description of the destination instead of URLs. Effective hyperlink text helps readers locate links and understand their destination and purpose. For users of assistive technology hyperlink text can be used to navigate content quickly. Raw URLs provide less information to everyone and are not useful to assistive technology users for navigation.

Hyperlink text should be: Descriptive

•    Describe the destination and why someone would follow the link.

◦ Effective descriptive text will help you locate the resource should the URL change.

•    “Click here” or “More” are not useful.

◦ Someone using assistive technology or skimming the content will not know what the link is for.

[]If the link destination is anything but a webpage, indicate the type of document file in the link text, for example, Accessibility Essentials Checklist (PDF,

131 KB) or Langara Student Services: Accessibility Services (video, 0:43)

•    When linking to PDF use a file landing page (if available on your platform) instead of direct download or opening automatically in browser. Many users are excluded by PDFs and will appreciate the warning.

Concise

•    Hyperlink text should be to the point without superfluous information. Surrounding text may provide further context if necessary.

Unique

Accessible Links

•    Each link that goes to an unique destination must have unique link text.

•    If multiple links go to the same destination, make the link text the same for each.

Visually distinct

•    Use standard link formatting, often underlined and contrasting colour.

◦ Generally, only use underlined text for links.

Hyperlink Examples

Consider the following examples of hyperlink text in context:

Create accessible hyperlinks that describe the link destination. Avoid “click here”, “see more”, or other links that do make sense out of context.

Verify reading order of slide contents via Accessibility >

Reading Order (on macOS Arrange > Selection Pane.) Learn more about creating slides with an accessible reading order.

[]And now consider the link text without context (text intentionally lacks appropriate colour contrast to visually emphasize what a screen reader user would hear):

Create accessible hyperlinks that describe the link destination. Avoid “click here”, “see more”, or other links that do make sense out of context.

Verify reading order of slide contents via Accessibility >

Reading Order (on macOS Arrange > Selection Pane.)

Learn more about creating slides with an accessible reading order.

[]Hyperlink text written in this style provides meaningful information about the links purpose and destination, independent of surrounding context. This is useful for skimming content, finding a previous resource, and navigating by a links list.

Consider how this differs from poor link text:

Read more about hyperlink text.

Read more about hyperlink text.

“Read more” provides no useful information on it’s own.

In most platforms the shortcut Control (Command on macOS) k will open the hyperlink tool. Or, highlight the text to be linked and use the link icon on the editor tool bar, such as the following examples:

[]     In               Microsoft            In Pressbooks                  []

The only exception to using descriptive hyperlink text is if the intent is to have users memorize the URL, such as d2l.langara.ca or langara.zoom.us/j/6043235403.

Accessible Links

[]

Some users report hesitancy to click on hyperlinked text for fear of fraudulent websites. To counter this, some post raw URLS. Avoid this practice. A better method is to instruct users to hover their mouse or move keyboard focus to a link and look to the bottom left corner of their browser window to see the raw URL.

If unsure, err on the side of adding alt text. It is better to present information twice than someone missing out completely.

Use type + focus + details 

To write alt text: Include the type of visual, describe the focus, and add essential details. Consider how you would describe the image if taking to a friend on the phone. Use proper punctuation and grammar and try to limit alt text to 2 or 3 brief sentences.

Alt text, caption, description 

Know when to use alt text, a figure caption, or long description. Alt text is only read to screen reader users, figure captions are a text description (usually) below an image, and a long description is a text equivalent in adjacent text or linked to in the figure caption.

Alt Text Quick Start Guide

[]

Alternative Text

[]

[]

Alternative text (alt text) is an image description coded into images. The alt text code is read by screen reader software to blind and low vision readers. Alt text allows all users to consider the context, purpose and meaning of images. Alt text relays the information that is critical to understand a visual element. Additionally, if for some reason an image cannot be viewed (slow connection, error with hosted image, or use of assistive technology) alt text provides the meaning and intent of an image.

According to WCAG 2.0 Guideline 1.1.1 : “All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.”

[]

[]

Images and diagrams are excellent compliments to text and vice-versa. Including visuals can break up large block of texts and increase understanding. However, do not overly rely on any one format alone.

[]

Add alt text to all visual elements to provide a text equivalent of the image, including:

•    Images and graphics

•    Diagrams and charts (add a table to accompany complicated data sets)

•    Images of text

•    Important logos

•    Linked images

•    Buttons styled with a photo

Use this tool to determine when to use alt text (including some tips for writing alt text based on image type) or when to mark an image as decorative.

[]

Before writing alt text, consider the context (information around image in content), purpose (what the image contributes), and meaning (the message the image conveys).

To begin writing alt text, consider how you would describe the image to someone over the phone.

Alt text should be succinct and accurate, including punctuation and grammar. There is no hard limit to the length of alternative text but aim for a sentence or two at most. Caroline Desrosiers offers a formula to write alt text:

1.      Identify the image type (if not a photo)

1.     Indicate if an image is a diagram, map, symbol, gif, drawing, cartoon, etc. The added context will orient users and aid their understanding.

2.      Describe the focus of the image

1.     What is the most important information in the image.

3.      Add relevant details

1.     Add details that contribute information or meaning but are not the focus.

[]

Type = graphic

Focus = north pole centered globe

Details = surrounded by olive branches. This is the United Nations logo.

So, that provides us with alt text that would read “Graphic of north pole centered globe surrounded by olive branches. This is the United Nations logo.”

Other types of images might be suited to a different formula. Object – Action – Context¹ is a method similar to type, focus, detail mentioned above.

1. Alex Chen

[]

Object = Line graph

Action = graph shows the amount of alt text written and the difficulty encountered in writing alt text over time.

Context = The difficulty in writing alt text rises briefly before quickly declining over time as the amount of alt text written increases consistently after an initial dip.

This method provides us with the alt text “A line graph that shows the amount of alt text written and the difficulty in writing alt text over time. The difficulty in writing alt text rises briefly before quickly declining over time as the amount of alt text written increases consistently after an initial dip.”

Use Relational Terms 

Describe the relative size and scale of elements in the graphic. Describe elements relative to the subject, one another, or to a common object.

Describe the directional and positional information of objects in the graphic relative to the frame, such as “on the right” or “near the top left corner.”

 

Depending on context, terms like “partial view,” “bird’s-eye view,” or “close-up.”

Materials, mediums, and textures can be identified by name where possible, but physical qualities should also be included.

For an image of a recognizable person or place, name them directly but also describe any relevant details.

What to Avoid 

Do not include “Image of…” or “Graphic of…” in alt text. Assistive technology will announce the presence of an image to the user before reading the alt text.

•    However, “Screenshot of…”, “diagram…”, “map of…”, “cartoon drawing…” are useful information to orient users.

Do not include:

•    Copyright information or attribution.

◦ Copyright information should be included in a caption below the image or in a list of references.

•    Emoticons.

•    Hashtags.

•    SEO keywords.

•    Promotional material.

•    Links.

Do not repeat information contained in adjacent text or included in a visible caption.

•    If the relevant information of an image is include in a caption or adjacent text, you can mark the image as decorative.

•    If graphic element has a descriptive caption and is labelled with “Figure 1” for example, alt text could read “Figure 1, image caption contains description.”

•    Image captions are useful for copyright, attribution, more information, or links.

Do not editorialize or include your own feelings or bias. Only include the important information to provide an accurate description.

Do not make any assumptions about gender or ethnicity. Prefer “they,” “them,” or “person” unless details are verifiable.

AI has improved the accuracy of machine-generated alternative text. Keep in mind that even an accurate description will provide no context or purpose. AI generated alt text may be useful as a starting point to be edited by a human.

Later chapters will cover these processes in greater detail.

[]

Useful alt text is important. Knowing when to mark an image as decorative is equally important. Consider images as active, informative, or decorative. An active image performs an action, such as opening a link or activating a button. Informative images contribute meaning or information, such as graphs, diagrams, or photos. Decorative images only have aesthetic value and do not contribute any meaningful information.

If you are not sure about an image, try viewing your content without the image. If no information is lost, you can mark the image as decorative. To do so:

[]

Mark decorative images with built-in tools (often a checkbox labelled “mark image as decorative” or similar) or with alt=“” in HTML markup.

[]

Image Attribution 

When adding an image attribution (copyright license etc.) to a decorative image, ensure the caption is also marked as decorative. If it is not, assistive technology would not announce the image, but would read the succeeding attribution text. This would lead the reader to believe they may have missed an important image.

[]

[]

Alt Text for Complex Images

[]

[]

Describing complex visual content, such as flowcharts and diagrams, can be difficult.

When using complex visuals, ensure all users:

•    Are aware there is an image with information

•    Understand the nature and purpose of the image

•    Are informed that the image is complex

•    Know how and where to get more information (if appropriate) ¹

[]

As mentioned in the prior chapter, alt text should be brief. For a complex image, it may not be feasible to describe the image in 1 or 2 sentences. Additionally, alt text does not support lists and headings. Structured text is essential to make long text digestible for screenreader users. That is one of the reasons why alt text should be brief.

Additionally, alt text cannot contain links. Links could be used to direct screenreader users to additional information about an image. However, links can be placed in figure captions. When alt text may not be sufficient, consider:

1. Adapted from: Recommendations - Describing complex images

Figure captions 

•    Figure captions are a label or description written under or beside a visual (such as the example image at the top of this page).

•    Figure captions will benefit all users by clearly identifying the image, its purpose, and its relation to the rest of the material.

•    Figure captions can include links to more information or who to contact for more information.

Text alternative 

•    For especially long descriptions, a text equivalent is recommended. For example, express a flowchart in text with headings and/or lists.

•    Considering adding text adjacent to the image. Using text and images together is an effective method to reinforce important information and emphasize key points. If an equivalent description is available in adjacent text there is no need for alt text.

•    If adding a text description adjacent to the image is not feasible, provide the long description at the bottom of the page or in an appendix. Make reference to the location of the description in the alt text or provide a link to the description in the figure caption.

Equivalent Data 

For visual data, such as a chart, include type, relevant labels, and a brief summary.

•    Include and link to or reference a table of the data used to generate the data visualization.

•    Use the alt text to make reference to the available table data, such as alt=”See table 3 for chart data.”

•    Use a figure caption to reference and link to equivalent data.

•    Express image information using headings and lists where appropriate.

A best educational practice is to use images to reinforce information. Try to present information in text and add images to supplement and highlight key points and processes. By doing that, you may not need to describe complex images as the information is already provided in text format.

Complex Alt Text Formula 

While the [Type] + [Focus] + [Details] alt text formula from the previous chapter is an excellent starting point, it may not be suitable for complex images. The World Wide Consortium has developed an expanded version:

“[Image type] illustrating [data type] showing [reason for including image]. This is a complex image and may require specific support for visually impaired students – please contact

[Name of designated person] if required.”

As an example, consider this model of the global carbon cycle:

[]Attribution:

Kandasam

y S and Nagender Nath B – via Wikimedia Commons.

To completely describe the information in this image would be impossible within the constraints of alt text. However, applying the complex image formula may be helpful:

“[3D landscape model] illustrating [global carbon stores (Petagrams) and fluxes (Petagrams/year)] showing [the complexity of the cycle and the main impacts of human interference]. This is a complex image and may require specific support for visually impaired students – please contact [Luke McKnight] if required”. (Note: remove [ ] before including complex image formula as alt text).

[]

Adapted               from        Complex images    –              making    sense       for accessibility. Use the following prompts to determine the best way to provide a text alternative to complex images:

Can the essential information be described in a few brief sentences?

1.      If yes, type a description of the image using the [type] + [focus] + [details] outlined in the previous chapter.

2.      If no, ask:

 

Does nearby text include the information in the image?

1.      If yes, mark the image as decorative or use alt text to direct users to text description.

2.      If no, consider:

Is the information in the image available in other resources?

1.      If yes, use figure caption to link to resource.

2.      If no, consider using AI to generate an effective description.

1.      Use Ian Linkletter’s Alt Text Assistant to create descriptive text.

2.      Or, use CoPilot to generate a description. Consider asking CoPilot to “outline the information in the image” or “describe the image in detail.”

3.      Google Gemini can also describe images and may be useful.

4.      AI generated descriptions are improving, but must be verified for accuracy. Read the AI Generated Alt Text chapter in this guide for more information.

If the description (AI assisted or not) is more than a few sentences, format the output with paragraphs, headings, and lists. Include the long description in adjacent text or an appendix. Make reference to the long description in the alt text or include a link in the figure caption.

If no useful description can be created and/or it is not feasible to link to additional information, use the complex alt text formula explained above to direct readers to a support contact for further details.

AI Generated Alt Text

[]

AI has rapidly improved in its ability to recognize and describe images. CoPilot, ChatGPT, and Gemini have shown to be useful at describing images and provide a starting point for writing alt text.

[]

For generating alt text and image descriptions using Microsoft CoPilot:

1. Set CoPilot to More Precise.

[]

When using CoPilot in the Edge browser sidebar, select the Add a screenshot button to take a screenshot of an active webpage.

[]

3. CoPilot requires specific prompting to produce useful image descriptions:

[]

•    “What does this image depict?”

•    “Describe this image to me?”

•    “Tell me the information in this image,”

 

[]

•    “Can you provide me a brief description of this image? Provide me all information in 2 sentences, please.”

•    “This image is a flowchart. Can you outline the process depicted? Please limit your response to 3 sentences.”

[]

Generative AI has been shown to be most effective when assuming a role. Include specifics in your prompt, such as “Act as a college biology instructor and describe the information in this cell diagram in 2 or 3 sentences please.” Read more about AI Prompting.

[]

Including instructions for limiting the length of response can be useful to generate alt text, which must be concise. However, for complex images it may be useful to remove that limiter from your prompts to ensure all information is included. Consult the Alt Text for Complex Images chapter for more information on providing longer descriptions.

CoPilot is a generative AI chatbot. That means you can reprompt and guide CoPilot based on its response. When CoPilot provides an image description, indicate what was incorrect or ask CoPilot to focus more on a specific element. Interacting with a chatbot is an iterative process of prompt, response, reprompt. Use AI as a starting point to understand the main information and visual structure of an image and then edit the output for accuracy, clarity, and brevity.

[]

Alt Text Assistant is a custom interface for ChatGPT with predefined parameters to help write alt text and image descriptions. Alt Text Assistant requires a ChatGPT Plus account.

If you have a ChatGPT Plus account, navigate to Alt Text Assistant:

1.      Select Can you help me create alt text? or Can you help me create descriptive text?

[]

Alt text is best for basic images. Descriptive text is necessary for complex images.

2.      Select the paper clip icon to upload an image.

3.      Select your image file.

4.      Press Enter or click Send Message (up arrow icon) button on the right of the text field.

[]

[]

To use Google Gemini to generate image descriptions select Upload image in the prompt box to add your image.

[]

Gemini understands what alternative text is without specific prompts. For basic images, try “Can you write me alternative text for this image, please?”

Gemini often returns a number of options for alt text and can be prompted to be more descriptive or focus on specific elements of an image as directed.

Use the Modify Response menu to prompt for longer, shorter, simpler, more casual, or more professional responses. Choose More professional if the initial response is not detailed enough.

[]

For more complex images, try “Can you write me a long description of this image, please?” This prompt returns a longer, more detailed description. Use the Modify Response menu to make prompts shorter, longer, simpler, or more complex.

You may also want to experiment with the prompting (and re-prompting) mentioned in the CoPilot section of this guide.

 

For further information on using CoPilot, Gemini, and ChatGPT consult the National Centre for AI Empowering Educators series.

Closed 

Captioning

Quick Start Guide

[]

Use closed captions 

Closed captions are a text file attached to a video, allowing viewers to toggle on or off the captions. Open captions, or subtitles, are burned into the video and not user choice. Use subtitles for additional languages in a video.

 

 

Leverage AI 

Advances in AI have greatly improved transcription of audio to text. Use AI to generate captions, then edit for accuracy.

[]

Use Kaltura Mediaspace 

All content uploaded to Kaltura Mediaspace/My Media in Brightspace after October 2022 will have machine-generated captions automatically added. Review and edit captions for accuracy.

[]

Use OneDrive 

Videos uploaded to OneDrive will have captions automatically generated. Review and edit the captions for accuracy.

[]

Live captions 

[]

Note that automatic captions will not be accurate enough to meet accessibility standards, so plan to hire live transcribers and/or interpreters.

 

Prefer videos with captions 

When choosing existing videos to distribute or show, choose videos that have captions.

[]

 

Closed Captions and Transcripts

[]

[]

Captions provide a text equivalent of all audio elements in a video, presented visually in time with the video. Closed captions can be toggled on or off by the viewer. Open captions are ‘burned’ into the video and cannot be turned off.

Traditionally, we think of captions as an accommodation for viewers who cannot hear the audio in a video due to hearing loss. Statistics suggest 4-5% of the general population suffer some form of hearing loss. That number increases to around 20% for people over aged 60. However, 80% of 18 to 25-year-olds regularly use captions when watching video.¹

[]

1. Youngs, "Young viewers prefer TV subtitles, research suggests"

•          All viewers, regardless of access means

•          All viewers by helping comprehension, understanding, and focus²

•          Viewers by ensuring names and terminology are communicated exactly as they are spelled.

•          Viewers watching a video with accents other than their own.

•          []User experience by allowing viewers to choose to turn on or off the captions.

•          Allows creators to indexing and searching of video via subtitle timestamps.

•          SEO.

•          Creators to easily locate a specific topic and create video chapters.

•          Creators to convert audio content to text form

Here is an example of the proper formatting of an .SRT file in TextEdit:

[]

Consider this guide for manually creating and editing .SRT files.

Use HappyScribe’s convert SRT to VTT tool or 3Play Media’s caption converter tool if you need a different file format.

For instructions to upload caption files, consult the platform guides earlier in this chapter.

[]

Transcripts are a text document containing all the audio content in media, including videos, podcasts, and audio recordings. Transcripts may also include additional information regarding visual elements and actions such as descriptions of what is on screen. Unlike captions, transcripts are not timestamped or synced with the media. A transcript is particularly useful to text to speech and screen reader users because many users set their software to read at a rate much faster than natural human speech. Transcripts can also be searched for words, names, and terminology.

Use Kaltura to generate a transcript of audio or video:

1.      Upload media to Kaltura

2.      Edit machine-generated captions

3.      Navigate to media

[]

5.      Choose the Download icon for the .txt file attached to the video

[]

6.      The .txt file downloaded will be a text equivalent of the closed captions but without timestamps.

OneDrive

If you generate transcripts using OneDrive, follow the instructions earlier in this chapter to create captions. Then, download the generated .VTT and use Microsoft VTT Cleaner to remove timestamps and other code.

Other Transcription Tools

Use Word to transcribe either by recording directly in Word or uploading an audio file.

Transcribe audio to text using Dragon Naturally Speaking.

Audapolis            is              an            open        source     transcript                editor      that automatically transcribes audio to text.

Mac OS supports dictation that could be used to develop a transcript.

Google Docs allows dictation that could be used to write a transcript.

[]BBC Subtitle Guidelines (the most extensive resource for captioning guidelines on the web). Google Chrome now offers live captioning on any video. This feature does not absolve content creators/ providers from adding captions to video content, however, if encountering a video without captions on the wild web, this feature can be invaluable. This tool relies on the built-in captioning settings on your computer. To view or change these settings:

•          Use subtitles and closed captioning on Mac

•          Change Windows caption settings

Tools

[]Use          built-in     tools        and features            to             make       your content accessible. Many platforms               and          software (Microsoft               Office,

Brightspace,            WordPress, Pressbooks)         include straightforward          tools        to make accessible content. Remember to:

•    Use built-in tools for tables, lists, links, and styles

•    Use templates

•    Use accessibility checkers

By using tools, templates, and checkers and the best practices and tools introduced in this guide, you can create accessible content that includes everyone at the same time.

The following chapters will focus on specific softwares and content management systems, expanding on the core principles of accessibility while providing platform specific instructions.

Tools

[]

Use the built-in editor tools to change font. All font options are available on the Brightspace editor toolbar.

•    Use a sans-serif font with a minimum size of 16

•    Avoid excessive italics

•    Left align text for languages that read left to right

[]

Function and Appearance: Templates, Font, and Colour

Contrast must be at least 4.5:1 for normal text (11-12 point) and

3:1 for large text (18 point +). Use the Accessibility Checker to verify.

To select font colours:

1.      Highlight the text

2.      Select the Select Color button in the toolbar

3.      In the Select a Color dialogue, use the sliders to change your colour until the contrast is at least 4.5:1

[]

Do not use colour alone to convey meaning or emphasis. You may use coloured text to highlight content, but best practice would be to also bold the text and include an indication, such as “important” or “remember” in text form. Further, ensure charts and diagrams do not rely on colour alone to convey meaning or relationships, consider using different line shapes, symbols, and labels.

Function and Appearance: Templates, Font, and Colour

Structure

[][]Headings allow learners to understand the logical structure of the page and navigate to different sections. Assistive technology can convey this structure to screen          readers    and          speech-to-text software if the headings are properly formatted, not simply text with increased size or bold text.

Pages should begin with an H1, with H2s, H3s, etc. nested below. Headings must be in sequential order. Do not skip a heading level. Body or paragraph text may follow any heading level. (Note: If the heading levels are not in order, the Accessibility Checker will report Heading order must be sequential.)

The HTML editor offers tools to build proper heading hierarchies. Highlight text and choose the appropriate heading level.

[]

Consider H1 as the title, H2 as section headings, H3 as subsection headings, etc.

[]

Properly formatted tables are accessible to text-to-speech and screen reader software.

Use the built-in tool to create a table.

Structure

[]

Here are some common errors the Accessibility checker will flag in table formatting:

1.      Tables must have captions.

How to fix: set a brief descriptive text to indicate the content of the table. The simplest way is via the

Accessibility checker tool which will prompt for a caption. This will add <caption> to within the <table> element.

2.      Tables must have at least one header.

How to fix: the simplest way is via the Accessibility checker tool which will prompt you to choose table header to “Header Row” or “Header Column”, which will change the selected data cells <td> to header cells <th>.

3.      Table headers must be associated with cells. How to fix: Set header scope to “Row” or “Column” for simple table header, which will add scope attribute (<th scope=”row”> or <th scope=”col”) to associate header cells and data cells.

*If that all seems rather complicated, do not worry, the Brightspace accessibility checker will walk you through stepby-step to make tables accessible.

[]

•    Bulleted (unordered) lists should be used for a list of items with no emphasis on their order

•    Numbered (ordered) lists should be used for items where sequential order is important, such as steps in a process

•    Properly formatted lists organize your information effectively and communicate it to assistive technology users as you intended

•    Do not manually insert symbols and use Tab to create indents. The Accessibility Checker may note improperly formatted lists

[]

To make a properly formatted list:

1.      Select the content you wish to make into a list

2.      Select the List menu button

Structure

[]

3.      Select Bulleted List or Numbered List

Text Equivalents and External Content

[]

Enter the image description in the “Alternative Text:” box. Images that do not convey information may be marked (“This image is decorative”) as decorative and screen reader software will ignore the image.

If you have an existing image without alt text, right-click on the image and select Image:

[]

Enter alt text in Alternative description field and click Save:

Text Equivalents and External Content

[]

The Accessibility Checker will display “Images must have alternative text” if alt text is not added. Alt text can also be added from inside the accessibility report panel.

Consider why each image has been included. Some images may be a useful way to break up blocks of text and reinforce information. However, avoid adding numerous decorative images as this will unnecessarily clutter the content pages. Read more about alternative text.

[]

Embedded or linked videos should be captioned. Audio recordings should have a transcript attached. Ensure media does not automatically play. Use an external video player such as Microsoft Stream or Kaltura instead of Brightspace’s built-in video player.

[]

Self-describing links are useful for all learners. A good descriptive hyperlink tells the reader what the linked resource is, a reason to visit the page, and who hosts it.

•    Hyperlink text should be unique and descriptive.

◦ Do not rely on surrounding text to provide context.

•    Do not paste URLs as text.

◦ Read a URL aloud to yourself. Is it is a pleasant experience? Assistive technology will read the full URL aloud if present. Avoid including the full URL. If you feel it must be included, considering using a link shortener like bitly

•    Do not hyperlink phrases such as “click here,” “Link:,” “see,” or “click for details.”

◦ Users know they must click on a hyperlink. Consider telling users where the link will take them and why they might want to go.

◦ Assistive technology indicates links to users. Using

“Link: example” will read as “Link link: example.”

•    If multiple hyperlinks link to the same destination, make the link text the same.

Consider the accessibility of the resource you are linking to. Also, consider indicating that you are linking to a video or an interactive element.

Text Equivalents and External Content

Adding Hyperlinks in Brightspace

1.      Highlight your descriptive text

2.      Select the link icon (looks like a small chain)

3.      Or, press Control (Command on macOS) and K

4.      Paste the URL in the dialog that appears

Additionally, you can insert a link via the format toolbar:

1.      Choose the Insert Quicklink button and select URL.

2.      Paste the URL in the appropriate field and add your descriptive text in the Title field

3.      Select Insert

Before linking to external content, consider the accessibility of the resource. Try to choose the most accessible resource available. The University of Washington Disabilities, Opportunities, Internetworking, and Technology center suggests avoiding PDFs. They suggest providing PDFs only as a secondary, alternate source of the information presented in HTML.

Alt text, Images, and Links

[]This chapter will focus on adding alternative text to images and how to use graphics in Word documents.

Assistive technologies employ alternative text (alt text) attached to images to inform users of the context and purpose of images and visual elements. Alt text is a text alternative to non-text content to ensure all users can access information. To add alt text in Office desktop programs:

1.      Right click on an image and select Edit Alt Text…

1. Enter a description in the dialogue box.

2.      If a graphic is purely decorative, check Mark as Decorative.

To add alt text in Office online programs:

1.      Select the image Alt text, Images, and Links

2.      Navigate to the Picture tab

3.      Select Alt Text and enter your description in the Title field. 

4.      If the image is purely decorative, leave the Title field blank.

TheOffice Accessibility Checkerwill flag images that need alternative text. Do not rely on the automatically generated alt text, it is rarely very useful. In the Accessibility pane, Missing alternative textwill appear as an error. You can select the drop down menu and choose Add a description.

[]

Review this Pressbooks’ chapter on Alternative Text, Microsoft guides for adding alt text to images, SmartArt, shapes, and charts, and Diagram Center’s comprehensive guide for alt text  for more information.

Add alternative text to simple charts but also include table data for complex charts and data sets. Best practice is to include table data adjacent to the chart, but linking to the data elsewhere in the document is also an effective method. Ensure the link text explains the destination.

Ensure embedded media has text equivalents. Videos must have closed captions and audio must have a transcript.

[]

Alt text, Images, and Links

Apart from adding effective alt text to images, there are a few additional considerations for visual elements in Word documents.

[]

Create meaningful hyperlink text.

•    Avoid vague instructions like “see” or “click here” or “read more”

◦ Not only are those not helpful out of context, but selfdescribing links may help you locate your resource if the URL changes

•    Do not paste URLs as hyperlink text

◦ If URLs must be included, provide self-describing hyperlink text and format URLs as normal text with no link attached.

•    Use default link styling (blue, underlined text)

To add a link in Word:

1.      Select the text you want to link

2.      Right-click and select Hyperlink or press Control

Alt text, Images, and Links

(Command on macOS) and K

3.      Verify the Text to Display text

4.      Paste the destination URL in the Address box

Formatting and Styles to Avoid

The       following formatting               and          object      types       are           not communicated to assistive technology or present significant barriers to some users and should be avoided:

•    Strikethrough

•    Highlighting

•    Dropcap

•    Word Art, Smart Art, text effects

•    Ungrouped related shapes

•    Watermarks

•    Symbols, except for the following safe characters:

◦ & (ampersand)

◦ / (slash)

◦ © (copyright)

◦ ® (registered)

◦ ™ (trademark)

◦ ¶ (paragraph)

◦ • (bullet)

◦ $ (dollar)

Creating Accessible PDFs

[]

In addition to adhering to best practices for plain language, font, colour, and other accessibility essentials, an accessible PDF is tagged. PDF tags are code that provides structure for assistive technology.

To create accessible PDFs, ensure you have Acrobat Pro DC installed on your device. Acrobat Reader lacks the necessary features to make PDFs accessible. PDFs can be generated in software such as Adobe Acrobat, but the most common method is to take an existing Word document or PowerPoint presentation and export it to PDF. Ensure that you start with an accessible document before exporting to PDF.

PDFs are popular but may not always be the best choice of file. PDFs are an antiquated format that are extremely time consuming to make accessible. Consider providing HTML, Word, or PowerPoint (most documents can have editing restricted) first. If readers prefer PDF, they can convert your file to PDF.

The best way to use PDFs is sparingly.

[]

The majority of PDF documents will be converted from a Word or PowerPoint document. Refer to previous chapters for best practices to create accessible documents in those formats and ensure you properly export the file to PDF.

Office Software with Acrobat Installed

In Word or PowerPoint:

1.      Select the Acrobat tab

2.      Choose Create PDF

1.                        Select Options

1.      Enable Accessibility and Reflow with tagged Adobe PDF

2.      Create Bookmarks

3.      Convert Word Headings to Bookmarks

2.                        Click Ok 3. Save file.

1. On Mac: Check Use Adobe Create PDF cloud service.

3.      Select Open.

Adobe guide to creating PDFs from multiple formats.

Scanned PDFs

PDFs are a common output format for scanned documents. A scanned document will be a ‘flat’ PDF—essentially an image of the scan. PDFs creating this way are untagged and not accessible.

Before scanning a document or book, consider looking for an existing accessible electronic version of your resource. However, when scanning a document to PDF:

•    Set scanner settings to at least 300 DPI (dots per inch).

◦ Higher number is better but increases the size of the scanned file.

•    Scan in black and white or 24-bit colour.

◦ Consider that information should not be conveyed by colour alone.

•    Some scanners have built-in Optical Character Recognition.

◦ You can tell if your scanner has this feature if you see terms like “Searchable PDF” or “Text PDF” in the scanner file output settings.

•    Push the spine of a book as flat as possible to eliminate gutter distortion and missing text.

•    Keep each scanned page to its own electronic page.

◦ Do not scan two pages of a book at once.

Ensure scans are free from:

•    Cut off text.

•    Crooked pages.

•    Shadows from the curvature of a book’s spine, dark

gutters between pages.

•    Poor contrast.

•    Pages rotated 90 degrees or upside down.

•    Handwriting, highlighting, underlining, watermarks or stains.

•    Blurring.

Use Optical Character Recognition:

Run OCR on scanned documents as a first step toward creating accessible PDFs. To do so in Acrobat Pro:

1.      Open scanned PDF in Acrobat.

2.      Select Scan & OCR from Tools.

3.      Select Enhance Text.

4.      Select Recognize Text to amend the document or repair any text not automatically detected.

1.      Select Tools > Edit PDF.

2.      Select text elements and edit text as appropriate.

From Webpage

When wanting to save a permanent copy of a website, do not use Print to PDF or Print > Save to PDF.

At this time there is no way to directly create an accessible PDF copy of a webpage, even if the page itself is accessible. Currently, we recommend using PrintFriendly as it creates tagged PDF files when exporting a webpage to PDF.

To use PrintFriendly, install the browser extension or paste the URL in the PrintFriendly web interface, then select PDF. This will download a PDF copy of the webpage to your device. The PDF copy will still need to be evaluated and remediated to ensure it is accessible.

Another option for saving a PDF of a webpage is to use the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine or Archive Today to create permanent copies of a webpage as it appears at the time of saving. Zotero saves a permanent copy of webpages when possible and allows for sharing, although readers need Zotero installed on their device.

[]

Use the following guide to improve the accessibility of your PDFs.

[]

Remediating PDFs can be difficult and time-consuming. Some people do this work full-time and still encounter difficulty. Please contact assistivetech@langara.ca for more information about remediating PDFs.

[]

One of the most important elements requiring manual checks is the reading order of your document.

Save your file before making any changes to the Order, Content, or Tags panes. Verify changes to the Order pane visually and on the Tags pane. Be aware that when changing the reading order of items in the Order pane, some content may “disappear” (YouTube video, opens in new tab) behind other content.

To solve this issue:

1.      Open the Content Pane (View > Show/Hide > Navigation Panes > Content).

2.      The top of the list is the bottom visual layer of the document.

3.      Selecting an element in the Content pane highlights the item in the document.

1.      So, if text disappears behind a textbox for example, locate both the text and textbox.

2.      Click and drag–or cut and paste–the offending item to the top of the list.

3.      This should return the visual order to normal.

Verify Reading Order:

1.      Open the Tags Pane (View > Show/Hide > Navigation Panes > Tags).

2.      Select the first tag at the top of the list.

1.      Use the down arrow to move through the list.

1.      You will see a visual highlight in the document when selecting each tag.

2.      If you need to re-order the reading order, cut and paste the tag (we find clicking and dragging can be difficult in longer documents).

3.      Navigate to the Order Pane.

1.      Select Options.

2.      Select Show Reading Order Panel.

1. This displays a number on each page element representing it’s reading order.

3.      Open the Content Pane.

1.      Arrow from top to bottom of content list.

2.      Verify that the visual order matches the reading order.

[]Reading Order determines the order of items when the document is read aloud by assistive technology. Reading Order also affects how the document will reflow, such as when zoomed or viewed on a mobile device. Changing the reading order may affect the Content hierarchy and Tags order. Any changes to reading order must be checked in Content and Tags panes.

The Content pane is a hierarchical view of the visual items within a PDF. Changing the order of content can alter the visual appearance of the document as well as the reading order of content.

The Tags tree is a hierarchical view of the code that determines the structure of the document. The order of tags affects the reading order for assistive technology, such as screen readers. But can also influence the order in which users tab through links or form fields. Changing the order of tags does not alter visual appearance of document.

These additional concerns contribute significantly to the amount of time and expertise needed to make full accessible PDFs.

Check Accessibility 

After you remediate your PDF, run the Accessibility Check tool again.

[]

Use Reflow or Export to Text export to verify accessible reading order.

1.      Select View > Zoom > Reflow,

1. As you zoom in, content should reflow into a vertical column with no need for horizontal scrolling,

2.      Many PDFs will not reflow. Check the order of text via File

(Acrobat on macOS) menu and select Export To > Text (Accessible). Save the file and view what text content is exported and how it is ordered. That is what and how assistive technology will read to a user (absent any interactives such as forms and image alternate text).

Use Preflight tools to correct remaining tagging issues:

1.      Navigate to Tools > Print Production > Preflight,

2.      Select PDF Profiles,

3.      Expand PDF/UA,

4.      Select Fix problems in PDF tagging structure,

5.      Click Analyze and Fix,

6.      Save new copy.

PDF Forms

[]

1.      Ensure form has clear instructions.

2.      Create meaningful visual labels for all fields, place labels adjacent to corresponding fields.

3.      Use tooltips.

4.      Include meaningful group labels where appropriate.

5.      Indicate required fields and field constraints (such as specific date format).

6.      Provide help and hints.

How to create a PDF form in Acrobat.

For additional information, consider WebAIM’s guide to form tags.

PDF Forms

[]

Create form layout in Word or InDesign and export as an accessible PDF document. Open in Acrobat Pro DC.

1.      Select Tools tab and find the Forms & Signatures section.

2.      Select Prepare Form tool and click Add or Add Shortcut.

3.      The Prepare Form tool will appear in the right side tools pane.

Prepare Form Tool

To add form fields:

1. Click Prepare Form tool

1.      Uncheck/leave uncheck This document requires signatures. Add signature lines within the form if needed.

2.      Ensure Form field auto detection is ON.

3.      Select Start.

1. The document is in Forms Editing Mode until the Close button in the top right is selected.

To delete a form field:

1.      With Prepare Form tool open:

2.      Right-click form field to be deleted

3.      Select Delete

Manually Create Forms

1.      Open Prepare Form tool

2.      Select form field type from top centre toolbar

3.      Click in document where you want to place form field

4.      Type a meaningful, unique name

1.      This is not a name that will display in the document, that remains the text created in the document beside the field. Unique field names are required because Acrobat will apply the same Tooltip (discussed below) to all fields with the same name. This will lead to confusion and inaccessibility

5.      Check Required if applicable

1.      Note: checking required only adds a red outline around the field. A better practice would be to add the “(Required)” to the visible form label (the text in the original document) and add “(Required)” to the tooltip wording

6.      Select All Properties

1.      This dialog presents all the options for each field

2.      Options include: border, font style and size, position, alignment, relationship to other fields (such as a group of radio buttons), data restrictions such value range or format requirements

7.      On the General tab the Tooltip field is required for full accessibility as the Tooltip is read to screen readers. Without a useful, unique tooltip such as “type your age”, screen reader users would hear something like “type a text” or “text input” and it may not be clear which field they are completing

8.      You can also access the Properties dialog by rightclicking a field and selecting Properties

1.      Or when a field is selected press CTRL (CMD on macOS)and i

Add Tags

Form fields need to be tagged:

1.      Open the Tags pane

2.      Select Options button

3.      Choose Find

4.      In the Find Element dialog, choose Unmarked Annotations

5.      In Type: select Search Document

6.      Click the Tag Element button

7.      Select Form in Type: dropdown and click Ok

8.      Advance to next field

Verify Tab Order

1.      With Prepare Form tool open

2.      Select More beside the tool icon and select Show Tab

Numbers

1. A number appears in the top left of each field indicating its tab order

3.      Examine the Fields in the right hand pane, this order reflects the tab order

4.      Drag and drop fields to reorder

Begin at the top of your form and press Tab to move between fields and verify proper order.

[]

Once you have added your form fields, mark placeholders

(such as a blank line for a signature) as artifacts.

Acrobat will likely group your placeholder text (such as options for checkboxes) as one paragraph. This will disrupt reading order. To avoid this, open the Tags pane, highlight text individually,     open        the           menu       in             the           Tags         pane        and choose Create Tag                 from        Selection… and choose Paragraph. This is a simple way to split text and place your form fields in between.

[]

To assess the accessibility and usability of your form, check:

Manually

1. Use the Tab key to move around the form.

1.      Radio buttons should be grouped, meaning you can Tab to the first radio button and then use the arrow keys to navigate around that group.

2.      Checkboxes cannot be grouped but should have a consistent tooltip (tooltips provide directions for the required input of the field to assistive technology) to give indication of their grouping.

3.      Text fields should be in the same order they visually appear.

Tooltips

1. Navigate to Tools (On main tab bar, via View > Show/ Hide > Tools Pane and then select More Tools at the bottom of the Tools Pane)

1.      Select Accessibility.

2.      Select Identify Form Fields OR Navigate to Tools and select Prepare Form.

1.      An overlay of the tooltip associated with each field appears.

2.      Additionally, the FIELDS pane lists all fillable fields.

1. Use the FIELDS pane to reorganize the Tab order of the form.

Text Fields

1.      Right click or double click on a fillable field.

2.      Select Properties > General.

1.      Each field must have a descriptive Name.

2.      A useful Tooltip field includes the title and short instructions to complete the field.

1. Tooltip is what is read out loud by a screen reader so it is very important.

3.      Repeat for each fillable field.

Radio Buttons

1.      Click and drag over all radio buttons in a group to highlight them.

2.      Properties > General.

3.      Enter a name for the buttons in the Group Name field.

4.      Select each radio button individually.

5.      Properties > Options.

6.      Enter a description in the Radio Button Choice field.

Check Boxes

1.      Select each check box individually.

2.      Properties > General.

 

3.      Enter the Name field with the question.

4.      Enter a short description followed by the text of the textbox as it appears on the document in the Tooltip field.

1. Because Check boxes cannot be grouped like radio buttons, try to be consistent with your ToolTips such as “favourite food: cookies”, “favourite food: fish”, “favourite food: pizza”, etc.

Tab Order

1. Open Prepare Form tool.

1.      Click dropdown menu beside FIELDS list.

2.      Select Show Tab Number.

3.      Rearrange tab order by clicking and dragging to correct order.

1. This does not move the items on the document, only ensures screen readers will read the fields in the order you intended.

Nesting

<Form> tags should be nested within the text tag that the form field is associated with.

Navigate to the Tags pane and cut and paste or click and drag appropriate form fields to ensure proper nesting.

Missing Form Field

You can add a single form field if you discover one missing during your checks:

1.      Navigate to Order.

2.      Open the Reading Order Panel.

3.      Click and drag to highlight over the desire form field area and select Form Field.

Note, you will still need to ensure the reading order, tags, and tooltip for the field.

[]

1.      Select Tools

1.      Accessibility > Accessibility Check or Full Check

2.      Right click on various errors for explanation and tips for fixing the error.

2.      Read Out Loud will give an idea of how a screen reader or text-to-speech software will read your document

1.      Select View > Read Out Loud > Activate Read Out Loud

A PDF with form fields will not reflow (by design), so do not use the Zoom > Reflow tool.

Tab through your form once more to be sure.

1.      Under Tools, choose Print Production.

2.      Select Preflight.

3.      Select the wrench icon and under Document select Mark all non-structure elements as artifact.

4.      Click Fix.

Tables

Tables in PDFs require special attention to ensure they are accessible.

PDF Tables need the following tags:

•    <Table>

•    <TR> table row

•    <TH> table header

•    <TD> table data

To tag a table properly, you must designate: Header cells:

1.      Use the Selection tool to select the first header cell.

2.      Open the Options menu in the Tags pane.

3.      Select Create Tag from Selection.

4.      Select Table Header Cell from drown down menu and select Ok.

5.      Repeat above steps for all header cells.

Data cells:

1.      Use the Selection tool to select the first data cell.

2.      Open the Options menu in the Tags pane.

3.      Select Create Tag from Selection.

4.      Select Table Data Cell from the drop down menu and select Ok.

5.      Repeat for all other data cells.

Row tags:

1.      Create the number of required empty row tags. There needs to be a <TR> table row tag for each table row, including header row.

2.      In the Tags pane, open the Options menu and select New Tag.

3.      Choose Table Row and select Ok.

4.      Hold Shift and click to select all cell tags in the first row.

5.      Drag and drop into the first Table Row tag (created in step 13), nested as children.

2.      In the Tags pane, open the Options menu and select New Tag.

3.      Choose Table and select Ok.

4.      Hold Shift and click all the <TR> table row tags.

5.      Drag and drop into the Table tag (created in step 19), nested as children and in logical order.

6.      For complex tables or to add context, provide a description of the table in the Alternative Text field by right-clicking the Table tag, selecting Properties, and moving to the Tag tab.

Complex Tables

Tables with split cells, merged cells, or cells that span multiple rows or columns can be difficult for assistive technology to interpret. Best practice is to create simple tables even if you can create a complex table that technically adheres to accessibility standards. To make tables accessible:

1.    Open the Order pane.

2.    Select the menu and choose Show reading order panel. 3. Select the table and select Table Editor button on the Reading Order panel.

4.       Right-click on spanned cell and select Table Cell Properties…

5.       If it is a header ensure Header Cell radio button is selected.

1. Use the Scope: dropdown to select the appropriate designation (Row, Column, or Both).

6.       In the Attributes section enter the Row span and Column span to indicate the number of rows or columns spanned by the merged/spanned cell.

7.       Click Ok and Yes to any warning messages.

The People v. PDFs

[]

What does PDF stand for? Some say it stands for Persistent Displeasing Feature or Please Disappear Forever.

PDF stands for Portable Document Format. The PDF file is one of the most common file types. The PDF was developed by Adobe in 1992. According to Adobe, the “PDF is a file format for representing documents in a manner independent of the application software, hardware, and operating system used to create them and of the output device on which they are to be displayed or printed.”¹ The software, hardware, operating systems, and devices we use today are unimaginably different from those available in 1992. The concept of ‘portable’ has changed fundamentally as well. Unfortunately, the PDF has changed little since its creation.

Pdfs are:

“Inherently inaccessible, unpleasant to read, and cumbersome to navigate online.”²

“Disliked by users, not accessible, disconnected from other

browsing behaviours.”³

“Harder to find, use and maintain. More importantly, unless

created with sufficient care PDFs can often be bad for accessibility and rarely comply with open standards.”⁴

The ubiquitous PDF format is harder to find, use, and maintain. Those are negatives for authors and readers. And yet, we appear addicted to them.

Provincial Legislation

Why should we discuss PDFs now? Why should we reconsider using PDFs?

PDFs are incredibly difficult to make accessible. People may ask, “why do I have to make things accessible?” First, it’s the right thing to do. Accessible content increase inclusivity, access to information, and participation. Accessible content is not for a niche audience. There are more than 926,100 British Columbians over the age of 15 with a disability and that number is expected to increase as the population ages.⁵

Second, British Columbia has accessibility legislation. In the

4.  Neil Williams, Why GOV.UK content should be published in HTML and not PDF

5.  Province of British Columbia, Accessibility Directorate

simplest terms, the legislation “aims to remove all types of barriers.”⁶ One of the noted barriers exists in “information and communications (human communication such as the way people interact and communicate in the way that works for them, and technical communication such as websites and documents).”⁷

Regarding PDFs, the Province of British Columbia has mandated a government standard on use of PDFs that states:

“Publishing content on a web page rather than in a PDF should be the default format for all government information. If there is a strong user need for a PDF, such as printing, the document must be made as accessible as possible. All PDF documents posted to the web should also be available in HTML format.”⁸ Additionally, the Province notes: “PDFs are difficult to access on smaller screens because they don’t resize or reformat to fit the screen. On mobile devices such as tablets or phones, PDFs do not comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0.”⁹ WCAG are the accessibility guidelines that inform most accessibility laws. It is safe to assume that WCAG will influence the minutiae of the Accessible BC Act.

Ontario enacted the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) in 2005. Using their experience can be useful to inform guiding principles in British Columbia. In 2021, the Province of Ontario’s Postsecondary Education Standards Development Committee produced initial recommendations to make postsecondary education more accessible to people

with disabilities. Under Barrier area 4: Digital learning and technology, recommendation 87, it is suggested that “postsecondary institutions shall use a PDF document only if an accessible alternative format is also simultaneously available.”¹⁰ The second phase of the recommendation notes that “postsecondary institutions shall provide suitable software and training for the creation of accessible PDFs”¹¹ to meet PDF/ UA 1/ISO 14289 standard. This standard is far beyond the checks completed by Acrobat’s accessibility checker and require expertise to achieve. Given that, and the Province of British Columbia’s example of providing HTML first and a PDF only as necessary, the simplest solution is to avoid PDFs.

 

 

In such cases, factor in the additional time and expertise needed to create accessible PDFs.

 

 

As will be revealed in greater detail below,

there are a significant number of drawbacks to PDFs and few, if any, positives.

Preference

A common myth about the PDF is that people prefer PDFs.

In fact, that likely means a content creator is saying “I prefer

PDFs.”¹²

PDFs often duplicate information that is available online.¹³ While it is fine to provide PDFs as an alternate, additional format, what’s the point? If you make an accessible document or webpage, why bother converting it to PDF? That’s just additional work.

The World Bank notes that 31% of PDF reports on their website have never been downloaded.¹⁴ A web developer noted that his employer’s website had 178 web page views for every PDF download.¹⁵ A web UX company in England notes that they have witnessed usability testers “sigh with resignation or immediately navigate away from a page that forces them into a PDF.”¹⁶ Harper College in Illinois has been working on The PDF Phase Out Project. Due to concerns about PDF accessibility and version management, Harper’s web team is working to phase out PDFs wherever possible.

People don’t prefer PDFs. People accept PDFs, or don’t. If they have arrived at a PDF and they don’t want to, or cannot, access it, that means they are excluded.

Security

There is an assumption PDFs are inherently secure. That is incorrect. PDFs can be locked, but many people do not and/ or know how to. Regardless, a locked PDF can very easily be unlocked. The top web search result for “unlock PDF” can do it. Many people don’t know how to edit a PDF, so they assume no one else does either.¹⁷ That is willful ignorance.

A read-only Word document is as secure as a locked PDF. However, despite some people’s misconception, PDFs are not locked by default. Most PDFs are Word documents exported to PDF. Why do the extra work? Ultimately, neither format are particularly secure.

However, the most secure option is HTML. Of course, someone could copy and modify the information from a webpage. However, any discrepancies can be resolved by referring to the original version (that you control). As well as being secure, a webpage will consistently be the most up to date and accurate source. Any disagreement over the accuracy or currency of information can be settled by referring to the active webpage.

Remote (and hybrid) Meetings

[]

Making a virtual meeting or presentation accessible includes all attendees equally. Consider the following tools and best practices for Zoom and Teams.

[]

Before a meeting, consider the following to ensure your meeting includes everyone:

Include relevant information in the meeting invitation

Copy Zoom meeting invitation and distribute with meeting invitation.

[]

Share material in advance

If your event includes material, share it in advance.

This helps:

•    Attendees follow along.

•    People consume information at their pace.

•    Improve comprehension and understanding by allowing people to make notes and annotations instead of frantically copying down the information.

•    People who prefer to print material.

•    People who wish to do preparatory reading.

•    Assistive technology users to access and navigate the content.

•    Interpreters, captioners, and transcribers to prepare and know names, terminology, and details.

If there is no material, consider sending a read-ahead or agenda. No one likes surprises. In the context of a class, your content will likely be related to the readings or material on Brightspace, so you may not have to explicitly create anything extra.

As always, ensure what you are sharing is accessible.

Mute on entry

For large groups, it may be best to have attendees muted when they enter to reduce confusion and crosstalk. People can unmute as needed later.

When setting up a Zoom meeting, toggle on Mute all participants when they join a meeting. Learn how to mute all Zoom participants.

In Teams, select Meeting options to set audio and video permissions. Learn more about managing attendee audio in Teams.

Enable automatic captions

[]

In Zoom, ensure captions are enabled. In the Zoom toolbar, click the captions button and select Enable captions.

[]

This allows viewers to enable captions on their device. Learn more about Zoom automatic captions.

 

 

 

 

 

 

[]

In Teams, select … More and select Settings > Accessibility.

In the Accessibility sidebar, toggle Always show captions in my meetings on.

[]

Use live captions in Microsoft Teams meetings

Zoom Meetings – Accessibility Handbook for Teaching and Learning (bccampus.ca)

Teams Meetings – Accessibility Handbook for Teaching and Learning (bccampus.ca)

Make a plan, ask for input, and communicate with attendees

Outline the agenda, structure, and expectations of the Zoom session to help with accessibility and anxiety and ensure a smooth flow. Indicate if you plan to use breakout rooms, if there will be polls, and how you would like questions/comments to be communicated. Consider:

•    Asking how attendees would prefer to communicate and come to a group agreement about communicating.

◦ Some students may not find it easy to access the chat window and video simultaneously.

◦ Some students may prefer to ask questions via chat.

•    Repeating questions aloud before answering them.

◦ This allows those not looking at the chat to know the question you are about to answer.

•    Asking a volunteer to monitor the chat and ask them to notify you of questions.

•    Encouraging participants to mute their microphone when they are not speaking.

Mute all participants

[]

If appropriate, ensure Allow participants to unmute is checked.

Learn more about muting participants in Zoom.

 

 

 

 

[]

In Teams, select People and click on the … More options menu in the top right.

Select Disable mic for attendees.

[]

Hosts can then allow individual users to unmute, or enable

mic for attendees using the same menu. Learn more about managing attendees in a Teams meeting.

Avoid complicated virtual backgrounds

Animated virtual backgrounds may be distracting for some and could cause anything from motion sickness to seizures for others. If you want a virtual background, use blur or other solid colour.

[]

In Zoom:

1.      Via the video settings menu, select Choose Virtual Background…

2.      The Zoom settings window will open to Background & Effects where you can choose a background.

[]

In Teams:

1.      While you’re setting up your video and audio before joining a meeting, select Background filters.

1. Your background options will display on the right.

2.      Select Blur to blur your background.

[]

How to set a background filter in Teams.

Use tools to highlight specific attendees

In Zoom consider pinning participants’ videos and allowing multi-pin. This will help attendees focus and/or pin the presenter and an interpreter.

In Teams, use Spotlight and Pin for presenters and interpreters.

Present with your audience in mind

Learn more about inclusive content delivery.

Additional Considerations

If you are unsure how to assist a participant, ask them. They may have encountered a similar barrier before and may recall a solution.

Ask participants if they would like any help or if anything is unclear.

Be patient. Everyone faces unique circumstances and some may need additional time and patience.

Respect participants desire to share or remain private.

[]

Consider sending a followup email after the meeting has concluded. A followup email could include:

•    Reminders

•    Action items

•    Links or other resources shared in chat or discussions.

◦ A useful method might be to look at the saved chat and glean links and talking points from that record.

•    Where and when appropriate, share a captioned video recording of the event.

•    Presentation material or related resources, even if you shared them prior to the meeting.

For repeating meetings, check in with attendees periodically for feedback on what is working or what changes they might benefit from. Ask attendees about pace and breaks. Review protocols for communicating (raising hands, use of chat, etc.) and ask for suggestions.

WordPress and Pressbooks

[]

 

[]

WordPress is one of the most common content management systems in use. Pressbooks is built on the WordPress platform, so many functions are the same.

Langara’s iWeb and CourseWeb use WordPress and this resource is a Pressbook.

[]

WordPress has thousands of themes. Some are free and many are paid. Regardless of what theme you use, it is easier to start with something accessible than fix an inaccessible theme.

You can filter WordPress themes for “Accessibility Ready.”

1.      Click the Feature Filter button

2.      Check Accessibility Ready checkbox

3.      Click the Apply Filters button

This reduces the list of themes significantly, but using an “Accessibility Ready” is not a guarantee of accessibility.

[]

Make content easy to read and navigate, by using:

•    Plain language.

•    Structured content.

◦ Use headings, lists, and tables.

•    Fonts

◦ Standard font size is 16px, but use em and rem units in CSS for font size.

◦ Avoid excessively decorative fonts; choose simple serifs or sans serif fonts.

•    Font must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1

◦ Read more about contrast in the Accessible Colour chapter of this book

Avoid:

◦ Leetspeak, calculator spelling (i.e., 80t5 for bots), text emoticons (i.e., >:( ), ASCII art (i.e., (^._.^)~)

◦ All capitals

◦ Excessive use of italics

◦ Justified alignment

[]

Headings provide structure for your page and the information it presents. Headings allow all users to skim and find what they need. Navigating a page by headings is essential for screen reader users to navigate the web.

To designate text as a heading, highlight your text and select the Paragraph dropdown to select your desired heading level.

[]

[]

Include the alt attribute for all images. If there is no alt attribute, assistive technology will read the src attribute aloud. Mark decorative images with alt=”” or leave alt text field blank in Media Library.

Enter an image description in the Alt Text field when uploading a new image:

[]

Or, edit an existing image to add alt text by selecting the image and choosing Edit:

[]

Or, manually change the alt attribute in the Text/HTML editor:

[]

Refer to the Alternative Text chapter in this book for more information.

If including multimedia, ensure videos are captioned and audio have transcripts available.

[]

To add a link, highlight text and use the Insert/edit link button or press Control/Command (on macOS) and K to insert a link. Good hyperlink text should:

• Be descriptive, unique, and meaningful

◦ Describe what a link is and why a reader would click on it

◦ Avoid using “click here” “read more” “download” etc.

◦ Maintain meaning when removed from surrounding text

Links should open in the same window by default. This helps assistive technology and mobile users. Visitors to your page can open links in a new tab if they choose. If a link opens in a new window or tab, include “(opens in a new window)” in the link text.

Avoid using URLs as hyperlink text. If you must provide the URL, include useful hyperlink text as outlined above and then include the URL as non-linked, regular text.

When linking to a file, indicate the file type either in context, such as “Download a PDF copy of this page”, or in parentheses at the end of the link text: “Download the report (Word document)”.

[]

Insert tables using the Table tool on the editor toolbar.

1.      Change table appearance via Table > Table Properties

2.      Set cell type and scope via Table > Cell Properties

1.      Of particular importance is setting header cells

2.      Set header row via Tables > Row> Table Row Properties

Avoid merged and split cells. You may use them, but additional work is required to set scope.

Check function of table by placing cursor in call A1 and pressing Tab. Ensure a logical reading order is followed.

Do not use an invisible table for alignment or layout.

[]

HTML is a more accessible format than PDF. If you need to share a page as a PDF, make it accessible using Adobe Acrobat and the chapter on PDFs in this book. EPUB or other XML formats are more inherently accessible formats.

Pressbooks offers many export options. To export your Pressbook:

1.      Navigate to the Dashboard

2.      Select Export from the sidebar

3.      Check the relevant formats

1.      PDF (for digital distribution) will be the best place to start in creating an accessible PDF copy

2.      EPUB 3 is one of the most accessible and customizable formats, but requires software for users to read

3.      PDF (for print) should only be used explicitly for printing purposes as it will retain none of the coded structure in you Pressbook

4.      There are other formats you find useful:

1.      XML and XHTML

2.      Common Cartridge for importing your Pressbook into a Brightspace course

[]

PebblePad

[][]PebblePad is            Langara’s online portfolio and experiential learning

platform. PebblePad can be used to create portfolios, blogs, basic webpages, online collections of files, formal and informal reflections, action plans, and more.

Regardless of type created, adding content is similar. This chapter will outline the steps to add accessible content to PebblePad.

In addition to the steps below, follow the general better practices for accessible content creation covered earlier in this book.

[]

Ensure you use a readable font size and style. Prefer sans-serif or basic serif fonts in size 16 or larger.

The toolbar appears when in an editable field. Use the Font Name and Font Size menus to adjust font.

[]

 

To change the font colour, select the font and use the Text Color and Background Color menus in the editor toolbar.

[]

Ensure font colour has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against the background colour. PebblePad does not include a contrast checker, but third party tools like WebAIM’s Contrast Checker can be used to determined colour contrast ratio.

The background colour of a text block can be changed using the Properties panel and selecting a colour from the menu in the Background color section.

[]

Title

Ensure each page has a descriptive, unique title. Enter the title in the Enter your post title here… placeholder:

[]

Or in the title field when you are prompted to save for the first      time:

[]

Headings

To create headings, use the Styles menu on the editor toolbar.

[]

Title is coded as a heading level 2 while SUB HEADER and Hint are coded as heading level 4. Skipping heading levels is not ideal, but use the heading tools available in PebblePad to give longer content structure. Use Title for the main topic, SUB HEADER for subsections, and Normal for body text.

Lists

Use numbered lists for steps in a process. Use bulleted lists for grouping of items. Use the Insert/Remove Numbered List and Insert/Remove Bulleted List buttons on the editor toolbar to create lists.

[]

Columns

Text blocks can be single column or two column.

1.      Select the text block.

2.      Open the Properties panel.

3.      Scroll to Text columns.

[]

Tables

Tables can only be created in Templates and Workbooks.

To create a table:

1.      Select Add Content.

2.      Choose Tables.

3.      Select table with appropriate header cell structure (column labels, row labels, or both).

[]

To modify table structure, select Get table cell options (the gear icon in the right of label cells). Use the menu to add or delete rows and columns and set required format type for column or row.

[]

Descriptive Hyperlinks

Instead of pasting raw URLs or links that read “Click here” or “Read more” write descriptive hyperlink text that can be understood independent of surrounding content. To add hyperlinks:

1.      Write meaningful text that describe the destination of the link.

2.      Highlight the descriptive text.

3.      Select Link in the editor toolbar.

[]

4.      Choose what type of element you wish to link to.

1.      In the case of a webpage, paste the URL in the dialogue box.

2.      Click Confirm Link.

Alternative Text

When images contribute information, they must have alternative text. Add alternative text to images in PebblePad when you upload the image as an asset in the alt text field.

[]

Or add alt text when adding an image block by selecting Add alt text.

[]

If an image already has alt text, the button changes to Edit alt text.

Alt text can also be added via the Assets Store. Select an image file asset and scroll to the bottom of the page. Enter alt text in the provided field.

[]

Captioned Videos

Use the Embed block for videos. Uploaded video assets in PebblePad                only         support   open        captions. Prefer closed captioned videos hosted on Kaltura Mediaspace, YouTube, or other supported platform.

Transcribed Audio

Use the Audio block to upload audio recordings. Upload and link to a transcribed text version of the audio below the Audio block.

H5P

[]

H5P (HTML5 Package) is an open source tool to create interactive content. As with any content, follow the basic accessibility essentials.

 

H5P has many different content types and this chapter will focus on general accessibility features and a few special cases.

[]

Provide all H5P elements with unique, descriptive titles.

[]

Check colour contrast manually using ColorZilla browser extension and the WebAIM Contrast Checker. Read more about colour contrast.

Write in plain language.

Use accessible hyperlinks that describe the link destination. To add hyperlinks in H5P text content:

1.      Highlight text to be linked

2.      Click the Link tool or press Control (Command on macOS) and k

[]

3.      Paste URL in URL field and select Ok.

[]

[]

Highlight font and use Paragraph Format menu change appearance and add semantic meaning to text.

[]

When adding an Image, enter a description in the Alternative text field. Or, check Decorative only for decorative images.

[]

When using the Collage element, select i (Image settings) and enter alternative text.

[]

The Collage element does not support marking images as decorative. But, given the visual nature of the Collage element, all Collage images should have alternative text.

Learn more about alternative text.

[]

To add closed captions to a Video (included in Interactive Book, Column, or Course Presentation):

1.      Expand the Accessibility accordion.

2.      Type the language of the captions in Track label.

3.      Change Type to Captions.

4.      Click Add and upload a WebVTT file.

To add captions to an Interactive Video:

1.      Expand the Text tracks accordion.

2.      Type language of captions in Track label.

3.      Expand Subtitles accordion.

4.      Select Add to upload a WebVTT file.

Use happyscribe caption converter to convert .SRT caption type to .VTT file.

Learn more about closed captions.

[]

There are some H5P elements that require special attention when used:

Course Presentation

Try to limit the number of elements presented on each slide of a course presentation. Content is read by assistive technology in the order it was added to the slide, starting with the first item added. Be aware when adding multiple blocks of text, images, or other elements to a slide as it is easy to confuse the reading order.

Audio Element

If using the Audio element, supply a text transcript in an adjacent accordion element or link to a text transcript of the audio.

[]

Video Accessibility

[]When creating video content ensure everyone can watch and understand. Plan for accessibility from the start because it requires more time and effort to fix things later.

Here are some better practices to make your videos more accessible:

1.      Write a script with audio descriptions of what is happening visually in the video.

2.      Use a microphone or headset to record your voice.

3.      Think about how light and the background will look in the video.

4.      Make sure information in the video has sufficient colour contrast and avoid flashing content.

5.      Order machine-generated captions and edit for accuracy using your script.

6.      Use edited captions to generate a transcript.

7.      Upload the video to an accessible video platform.

[]

To ensure full accessibility for all viewers, important visual elements in your video must be included in the audio. One effective method to achieve this called audio description: a separate audio track narrating visuals and actions. Audio description is usually indicated with an AD or D))) logo or icon.

Audio description requires a separate script and recorded audio track and some video players do not support multiple audio tracks.

As an alternative, integrated description may be a simpler solution. Integrated description is a way to describe visuals aloud as part of the video’s natural flow. This accessibility practice benefits not only blind and visually impaired viewers, but all viewers will be better able to follow along, particularly if a video includes demonstrations or instructions. Integrated description may help reduce audience members’ cognitive load because it reduces the need to split their attention between visuals and audio.

To include integrated descriptions to your script, consider the following best practices:

1.      Avoid sensory-only instructions that rely on sight or colour.

2.      Describe what is on screen in specific terms.

1. Refer to important images, charts, logos, etc.

1.      Write descriptions and practice reading them to maintain the flow of your presentation.

2.      Mention slide numbers, figure labels, question numbers, etc.

3.      Refer to specific named elements like menus, links, buttons, page features like headings, regions (sidebar, navigation menu, footer, etc.), and major waypoints like breadcrumb navigation or pagination.

4.      Describe actions like “open menu,” “click button,” “select checkbox,” etc.

5.      Avoid vague references like “here” or “there” as most users may not know where you are referring to.

6.      Use relative positions including above, below, left, right, top right, etc. as readers and assistive technology typically read in a Z pattern starting at the top left.

7.      Provide summaries of charts, lists, or other data

groups.

1. Include relevant information about the relationship and hierarchy between information.

Remember that you are the expert in the content you are presenting. You know why information is included and what is important. Consider asking someone to listen to your audio presentation without seeing the visuals and ask what parts were hard to follow or confusing.

[]

Try to use simple language when possible. Explain complex terms, jargon, abbreviations, and acronyms. Write for the intended audience.

[]

When recording narration or voiceover:

•    Ensure there is no background noise.

•    Use a dedicated microphone (not the microphone built-in to a laptop, for example) when possible.

[]

When recording with a camera, remember to record:

 

•    In at least 720p resolution.

•    With a neutral, consistent background.

•    With adequate lighting.

[]

When recording your screen:

•    Remove clutter.

•    Silence notifications.

•    Record only main content.

Colour

If screencasting or filming a whiteboard, remember to:

•    Avoid using colour alone to convey meaning.

•    Use sufficient colour contrast.

Avoid flashing content

•    Avoid content that flashes more than 3 times per second. Flashing content can cause seizures.

•    If flashing content is essential, provide a warning at the start of the video.

[]

Captions are text of the audio in a video, synchronized with the video content. To create captions:

•    Use automatic captioning tools to develop a draft.

•    Edit automatically generated captions ensuring names and terminology are correct.

◦ o Include relevant sound effects, music, and other non-speech audio elements.

◦ o Identify speakers if not visually obvious.

•    Sync caption timing with audio.

Closed captions can be toggled on and off by each viewer. Open captions are part of the video file and cannot be toggled on and off. Prefer closed captions except for foreign language subtitling.

[]

A transcript is a text version of multimedia content. To make a transcript:

•    Copy captions to blank document, remove the timestamps, and format into paragraphs.

•    Transcripts can include additional information such as action, setting, or persons present in the video.

◦ o Integrated description will already include this information and eliminate the additional work of adding descriptions to the transcript.

•    The transcript can be a useful place to share links mentioned in video.

[]

An accessible video player supports closed captions, transcripts, is keyboard accessible, and does not autoplay. Support for an additional audio description track is a bonus, but not required.

Email Accessibility

[][]Crafting accessible emails helps             ensure communication is readable by   all            recipients.               The instructors        below                 are specific to Outlook, but the principles apply to all email clients.

Include a descriptive subject line to guide assistive technology and help recipients understand purpose.

[]

•    Avoid assuming recipients’ knowledge.

•    Explain abbreviations, initialisms, and and acronyms.

•    Make clear requests.

•    Provide summaries of long emails.

[]

•    Use automatic colour combinations (black text on white Email Accessibility

background).

◦ Ensure any other colours used have a contrast of at least 4.5:1 against the background.

•    Do not rely on colour alone to convey information.

•    Use readable fonts that are sans-serif or basic serif and at least 12 point size.

•    Avoid excessive use of italics, bold, or all caps.

•    Reserve underline for hyperlink text.

[]

•    Use built-in tools for lists, tables, alignment, and indents.

[]

Use meaningful hyperlink text in place of long URL strings.

1.      Type meaningful link text in the body of your email.

2.      For Outlook on the web:

1.      Select the text.

2.      Select the Insert Link button on the formatting toolbar or press CTRL + K/CMD + K on macOS.

3.      Paste the URL in the address dialog.

3.      For Outlook on desktop:

1.      Select the text.

2.      Right click and select Link or press CTRL + K/CMD + K on macOS.

3.      The text you selected is displayed in the “Text to

Email Accessibility

display” field.

4.      Paste the URL in the address dialog.

Avoid pasting raw URLs in your emails as these are difficult for users of assistive technology to consume and do not provide meaningful information about the link destination.

[]

Add alt text to images so that recipients who cannot view the image can determine its purpose and context. For Outlook on the web:

1.      Right click on an image and select Add Alternate Text.

2.      Type your description and click OK.

For Outlook on desktop:

1.      Right click on an image and select Edit Alt Text.

2.      Type your description in the dialog.

[]

Outlook for desktop has a built-in accessibility checker that runs in real time as you draft an email. A message will display when Outlook detects a possible error.

Outlook on the web includes an accessibility checker. Select the three dot icon on the Send/Discard toolbar and choose Check for accessibility issues.

Learn more about Outlook accessibility settings here.

Accessible Surveys and Forms

[]Online forms are useful for data collection and surveys.

Accessible               forms       are designed to meet the access needs of all respondents. Accessible                forms       increase inclusivity, usability, and the number of people who can participate.

There are different online tools              available,                 but           it’s

essential to consider the content and structure of your form or survey to make it accessible.

Here are some best practices to improve accessibility, usability, and effectiveness of online forms:

[]

At Langara, we support Microsoft Forms, Brightspace Surveys, and Zoom polls. These platforms offer various question types and features. Consider that Zoom polls must be set up before the meeting begins.

Avoid SurveyMonkey and Wufoo as they present many accessibility barriers to users.

[]

Start your form with clear instructions. Include information about:

•    Number of questions.

•    Time limit (if applicable).

•    Due date (if applicable).

•    How to complete the questions.

•    What the survey is about.

•    How required fields will be indicated

◦ o Plain text “required” in the visible form label is the best method.

•    Instructions for form fields that require specific formatting or other requirements.

•    Help or contact information.

Clear instructions help respondents budget their time, manage their expectations, and understand the purpose of the survey.

[]

Use simple and direct language that everyone can understand. Avoid jargon, abbreviations, and acronyms or when you use them, explain them when they first appear. Avoid negative questions that might confuse respondents by requiring a ‘Yes’ to confirm a negative.

Accessible Surveys and Forms

[]

Indicate required fields in plain text labels or question prompts. Don’t rely on colour alone to indicate a required field.

[]

Every field should have visible labels and example placeholder text in the fields. Add meaningful labels above or to the left of each field.

[]

Number each question and add a progress indicator to help respondents to understand the survey’s length.

[]

If the platform allows, give respondents the option to pause, save, and resume the survey later.

[]

 

Do not impose a time limit on respondents unless essential to the purpose.

If a time limit is needed:

1.      Clearly communicate the time limit in the instructions.

2.      Provide a warning before time runs out.

3.      Offer a method to extend time at least once.

4.      Make sure the timer is obvious and accessible without being intrusive.

[]

Use long text or rich text fields that allow respondents adequate space to answer. Ensure forms display properly on a mobile device. Pay attention to the layout of multiple-choice and radio buttons.

[]

If respondents make mistakes or enter invalid data, show accessible error messages that specify the incorrect field and provide guidance on the required formatting. For example: “Dates should all be entered in the format mm/dd/yyyy, (as in 06/29/2023)” or “Passwords must contain at least 8 letters and/ or numbers.”

[]

Accessible Surveys and Forms

Test the keyboard functionality of your form to ensure the focus order follows the visual layout. Use Tab to move between fields, Space to open a menu and select checkboxes, and arrow keys to navigate menus and radio buttons.

Use Obvious Focus Indicator

Ensure there is an obvious visual indicator when a form field has keyboard focus, such as a noticeable ring around the field.

[]

After clicking the submit button, include a confirmation dialogue to prevent accidental incomplete submissions.

Excel

[]

[]

Microsoft Office includes built-in tools to assist you in making accessible documents. This chapter includes best practices and instructions to create accessible Excel spreadsheets.

[]

The document title is announced to assistive technology and is much more pleasant and informative than the file name (but allows you to retain your file naming conventions). Other fields are useful but not required.

Document Title

To add a document title:

1.      Navigate to File > info.

1. On MacOS: File > Properties > Summary tab.

2.      Enter a descriptive title in the Title field.

This cannot be done in Office Online.

[]

For Excel spreadsheets:

•    Use sans-serif or simple serif font, size 11 or greater

◦ Size 9 is acceptable for foot/endnotes or captions

•    For PowerPoint, use font size 18 minimum

•    Use an accessible colour

◦ Font must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against the background

•    Left-align text

•    Use built-in tools for spacing and alignment

To set font colour:

1.      Navigate to the Home tab.

2.      Select Font Colour.

3.      Click Automatic.

If your document has hard-to-read text contrast, the status bar will indicate Accessibility: Investigate. Go to the Review tab and click Check Accessibility button. Under Warnings the hard-to-read text will be noted with a dropdown menu to change the font color.

•    Older versions of Word’s Accessibility Checker will not catch contrast issues.

•    Consider checking your colours with WebAIM’s Contrast Checker if you are unsure.

Do not use colour as the only means of communication.

Visit the accessible colour chapter of this Pressbook for more information.

To set text alignment:

•    Use left-aligned text for languages that read to left to right, use right align for languages that read right to left.

◦ Set alignment in the Paragraph tools on the Home tab.

•    Avoid justified alignment as it can create excessive blocks of white space when zoomed and can create ‘rivers of white space’ which are gaps that appear to run through a paragraph due to coincidental alignment of spaces.

•    Use at least 1.5 line spacing.

[]

Providing structure to spreadsheets is essential for assistive technology, but help all readers navigate your data efficiently and understand relationships between topics.

Styles (Styles group > Headings and Titles) in Excel have no semantic meaning like they do in Word, they are only decorative. Feel free to use styles, but also include textual cues to indicate meaning and importance.

Excel structure best practices:

•    Include white space around the text in the template, so it’s easier to read.

•    Ensure appropriate row height: Home > Format > Row Height.

•    Ensure appropriate column width: Home > Format > Column Width.

•    Use accessible colour contrast.

•    Use 12 point or larger text (Home > Font Size).

•    Include worksheet names and table titles.

◦ Right-click on sheet and select Rename.

◦ Give each sheet a unique, meaningful title.

Microsoft guide to finding accessible templates for Office products.

Floating elements such as charts, graphs, or images are read by assistive technology in the order the element was added to the sheet. However, the reading order can be amended:

1.      Navigate to Home.

2.      Select Find and Select.

3.      Choose Selection Pane.

1.      The reading order is from the bottom of the list to the top.

2.      Click and drag items in the Selection Pane to the correct order.

1. Moving items in the Selection Pane does not change the visual layout of items on the sheet.

[]

Assistive technologies employ alternative text (alt text) attached to images to inform users of the context and purpose of images and visual elements. Alt text is a text alternative to non-text content to ensure all users can access information. When including images in Excel:

1.      Right-click the object.

2.      Select Edit Alt Text…

3.      Enter a concise text-equivalent of the image or select Mark as decorative.

However, when adding a chart or graph to Excel:

1.      Right-click the object.

2.      Select Edit Alt Text…

3.      Enter a broad description of the chart or graph and make reference to the equivalent tabular data.

4.      Include the data table immediately following.

Review this Pressbooks’ chapter on Alternative Text for more information.

Include table data for charts.

Ensure embedded media has text equivalents. Videos must have closed captions and audio must have a transcript.

[]

Apart from adding effective alt text to images, there are a few additional considerations for visual elements in Office documents.

To add a chart in Excel:

1.        Select data, go to Insert and select chart type desired.

2.        Add a descriptive, unique Chart title.

3.        Select chart, go to Design > Add Chart Element > Axis Titles. Select Primary Horizontal or Primary Vertical and type a descriptive title for the axis.

4.        Select chart, go to Design > Add Chart Element > Data Labels > Select appropriate label type for clarity.

5.        Select horizontal or vertical axis, go to Format > Current Selection > Format Selection. From the Format Axis pane, adjust axis type, axis crosses, position, tick marks, label position, interval, and number format for maximum legibility.

6.        Ensure colour is not the only way to differentiate chart data. Consider using symbols or dots on line graphs or add a text legend to a bar chart, for example. Try previewing your document in greyscale (via print preview) to understand how problematic it is to rely on colour alone.

7.        Add a legend by navigating to Design > Add Chart Element > Legend.

8.        Ensure chart elements have sufficient contrast. Change chart shape or line colour by selecting the shape > Format Data Point > Fill and Line > Fill > Color > More Colors.

9.        Ensure font is sans serif, 12 point or larger, and has sufficient contrast (4.5:1). Home > Font, Font Size, Font Colour to adjust font.

10.     Ensure chart data is available in tabular form as well, preferably directly following the chart itself.

1.      When following this practice, Right-click the chart.

2.      Select Edit Alt Text…

3.      Mark the chart as decorative or reference location of table data.

11.     Learn more about creating charts and learn about different chart types in Office.

Floating elements such as charts, graphs, or images are read by assistive technology in the order the element was added to the sheet. However, the reading order can be amended:

1.      Navigate to Home.

2.      Select Find and Select.

3.      Choose Selection Pane.

1.      The reading order is from the bottom of the list to the top.

2.      Click and drag items in the Selection Pane to the correct order.

1. Moving items in the Selection Pane does not change the visual layout of items on the sheet.

For a chart or graph, provide data in table form beside the element. If size and spacing is a concern, place the data in another sheet and provide a link near the floating element. To link within Excel:

1.      Select the cell in which you wish to place the link.

2.      Navigate to Insert > Links group > Link or right-click the cell and select Link or select the cell and press CTRL+K (CMD+K on Mac).

3.      Select Place in This Document and enter the cell reference (ex. A1), ensuring you have selected the correct sheet.

1. In the Text to Display field, enter descriptive text to explain the link’s purpose.

4.      Click Ok.

5.      Repeat the process to provide a link back to the object.

Read more information on links in Excel.

 

[]

Create meaningful hyperlink text.

•    Avoid vague instructions like “see” or “click here” or “read more”.

◦ Not only are those not helpful out of context, but selfdescribing links may help you locate your resource if the URL changes.

•    Do not paste URLs as hyperlink text.

◦ If URLs must be included, provide self-describing hyperlink text and format URLs as normal text with no link attached.

•    Use default link styling (blue, underlined text).

[]

Tables are useful for organizing data. Properly built and formatted tables are completely accessible. In Word and PowerPoint, navigate to:

1.      Insert tab.

2.      Table.

3.      Insert Table.

4.      Indicate number of columns and rows and press Ok.

1. You can add columns and rows later.

Set a header row/column:

1.      Click anywhere in your table,

2.      Select Table > Table Design tab > click Header

Row (or Header Column, if applicable) checkbox,

3.      Select Banded Rows or Banded Columns for a landscape document,

4.      Accessible tables only have one header row, one header column, or both.

Right-click on table and select Table Properties for advanced table options via the table properties dialogue.

Navigate to Table Layout, select Repeat Header Rows to repeat headers across page breaks.

In some instances it may make sense to add alt text to a table as a summary. To do so:

1.      Navigate to Table Properties.

2.      Select the Alt Text tab.

3.      Add a Title and a Description.

4.      Click Ok.

Convert Excel data into a table:

1.      Select the data to be included in the table.

2.      Insert > Table.

3.      Double check select cells are correct and check My table has headers.

4.      Select Ok.

5.      Select anywhere in the table, use Design > Table Name and give the table a meaningful title.

Consider putting tables on separate worksheets. If you place multiple tables on the same worksheet, leave a blank row between each table. All tables should start with a title in column A.

Use accessible table designs:

1.      Select the table and go to Design.

2.      Select the features you want (Header Row, Banded Rows, or First Column).

1. A Header Row or Header Column or both are required for an accessible table.

3.      To show all available table styles, select More or the dropdown arrow.

4.      Most accessible tables will be Medium styles with strong contrasting colors.

Best practices:

•    A concise, descriptive table title helps with context and organization.

•    Do not use nested, merged, split, or unnecessary blank cells.

•    Ensure cells have adequate padding and margins.

•    Do not use coloured cells or text alone to indicate meaning.

•    Do not use tables with invisible borders to format layout.

•    Office accessibility checker does not note table errors.

◦ Click in the top left cell, then use the Tab key to see ensure your table reading order is logical and consistent.

[]

Best practices:

•    If you have no data to enter in cell A1, use it for a title or to indicate the number of sheets in a workbook.

◦ For a workbook with many sheets, the first sheet should be used a summary and index with links to other sheets.

•    Avoid merged cells in tables.

◦ However, an acceptable practice is to add a descriptive title above a data set by merging the cells and centering the text.

◦ Cell A1 is the best place for a description of a sheet.

•    Avoid blank cells for formatting or alignment purposes (adjust column/row width and height instead).

◦ A single blank row or column is allowed where appropriate. Best practice would be to include the text “No data” in blank cell.

•    Ensure cell has appropriate format by number type.

◦ Home > Number drop down > select relevant number formatting (date, currency, time, etc.).

•    Ensure appropriate decimal place from Home > Numbers group > Increase Decimal or Decrease Decimal.

•    Colour, such as conditional highlighting, may be used but should be accompanied by a text equivalent indicating meaning.

•    Comments are accessible and a great way to convey information or messages.

Hide unused cells:

1.      Select the first column cell to be hidden.

2.      Press Shift and CTRL (CMD on Mac) and Right Arrow key.

3.      Right-click and select Hide.

4.      The process is the same to hide unused rows, by selecting the first row to be hidden.

5.      Press Shift and CTRL (CMD on Mac) and Down Arrow key.

6.      Right-click and select Hide.

However, avoid hiding cells in the middle of data. If you must, add a comment indicating so. Excel comments are accessible and a great way to communicate with readers.

An additional method would be to include an “End of Table” message after the last row of data. The text can be in white as this is only a hint to assistive technologies that the table is complete.

Multiple data sets:

•    Multiple sets of data should be split into separate sheets

•    Sheet names should be meaningful and unique

•    Each sheet should follow the same accessible formatting

Within a worksheet, you may group data for easier navigation. Select the data you want include and select Formulas > Define Name. Enter a descriptive name and double check the selected cell range, then click Ok. This allows users to press CTRL + G to quickly jump to different groups of data.

Cell padding:

Ensure appropriate cell padding by adjusting column width and row height.

1.      Right-click on row or column label.

1.    Select Column Width… and/or Row Height… to adjust.

2.      Or in Home > Cells group > Format dropdown.

1.    Select Autofit Row Height and/or Autofit Column Width.

• Text should not overflow cells.

◦ Adjust column width or use text wrapping: Home > Wrap Text button.

Named regions and header names:

Using the Excel Names feature, it is possible to name a range of cells in such a way that header cells are spoken along with the value of the cell. This allows a person using a screen reader to understand the structure of a table more clearly. This is only necessary for more complex or lengthy sets of data.

Formats to Avoid 

The   following formatting               and          object      types       are           not communicated to assistive technology or present significant barriers to some users:

•    Strikethrough

•    Highlighting

•    Dropcap

•    Word Art, Smart Art, text effects

•    Ungrouped related shapes

•    Watermarks

•    Symbols, except for the following safe characters:

When converting data to a table, keep in mind the contrast of the default styles. Only the White, Light Blue, and Blue styles in the Light and Medium categories have sufficient contrast between cell shading and font colour. All of the styles in the

Dark category have sufficient contrast

[]

[]

Use Office products’ built-in accessibility checker to check for common issues. Note, these tools may not catch all possible accessibility issues.

The Microsoft Accessibility Checker report can be used to find common errors like missing image ALT text, merged cells and other issues in an Excel document. Select Review > Check Accessibility. The accessibility pane will show errors, warnings, solutions, and tips.

In the Accessibility pane select Keep accessibility checker running while I work checkbox to see a realtime accessibility message in the bottom status bar. Click Accessibility: Investigate at anytime to open the Accessibility pane.

Like any automated tool, Office’s accessibility checker will not catch any and all accessibility issues. Here is a summary of what it does look for and how well it catches those issues:

          Element checked                                   Reliability of checker

Poor.

Will show if there are no headings on a long document but doesn’t flag

      Structure and use of heading ^(styles issues on shorter)documents. A single heading is enough to pass

the checker even though the document remains

inaccessible. It cannot test the logic of the heading structure. Moderate.

Can find poor colour

       Colour                                                        contrast but cannot tell if

colour has been used as a sole indicator for information.

Moderate.

Will find images that have neither Alt text, nor are marked as decorative as well as those where the Alt text is just the file name.

[]Use of images                                         But it cannot identify whether the Alt text is appropriate or even meaningful. It will find images that are not in line with the text. In-line images may not be as aesthetically pleasing but they are easier for screen readers to find.

Poor.

      ^(Links                                                          )It does not check for link

text.

Best practice is to share material in advance of presentation or class.

◦ This allows users to check for barriers beforehand

1. This table is adapted from work originally developed by AHEAD and Alistair McNaught and is made available under a CC BY-NC-SA creative commons license.

◦ All users can take additional, in-depth notes and understand terminology and names with greater comprehension

◦ Users that experience barriers can zoom in or adjust the documents to their viewing preferences

Excel documents have various options for protecting your Excel workbook, sheet, or part of your spreadsheet. Choose the appropriate level of protection.

Export to PDF

Excel documents can be exported to PDF, however the amount of time and expertise required to create an accessible PDF of an Excel document means all other avenues should be pursued first.

Best practice is to share the Excel file directly. You can protect an Excel file to prevent changes.

Padlet

[]

As of December 2023, Padlet is still working on creating an accessible platform. The technology some students need for learning may not work with Padlet. If using Padlet, be prepared to offer alternative assessments and means of engagement for students.

[]

Be aware that Padlet is not fully accessible and will present barriers for various types of assistive technology and students.

[]

Choose a neutral, uncomplicated background. Navigate to Settings and click Wallpaper to choose a background.

  -- ----
     
     []
  -- ----

When selecting a wallpaper:

Prefer

•    Solid colours

•    Gradients

•    Simple textures

Avoid

•    Photos

•    Art

•    Illustrations

Posts can be made with different colours. Do not use colour alone to differentiate or group information.

[]

Consider that Canvas layouts, while useful for brainstorming, may be confusing for some learners to follow. Additionally, the reading order of content will be impossible for assistive technology to verify. Prefer Wall, Shelf, Grid, or Stream layouts to ensure a consistent flow of information.

When starting with Blank Board, users are offered a choice of layouts:

  -- ----
     
     []
  -- ----

Toggle Sections on for maximum organization.

Change the layout of an existing Padlet via Settings > Layout.

[]

Visuals

When adding visual elements like pictures, drawings, or videos include a description in the Caption field as Padlet does not

[]

Videos

Padlet does not support adding closed captions to uploaded or recorded videos. If linking to a video, choose videos with closed captions. Add title of video to Subject line when adding videos.

Links

When adding a link to Padlet, enter a description of the link

[]

In this example, “Google homepage” would be a useful Subject to inform users about the link’s destination and purpose.

Consider best practices for linking, specifically including (PDF) or (Video) in the Subject when links land on a PDF or video.

Files

When uploading a file, write a descriptive tile in the subject line and include file type, such as PDF, Word, or PowerPoint.

Accessible Math

[]

Math and science can be challenging for many learners regardless of ability or experience. If that content is not accessible, even more learners may be left behind. Creating accessible math and science content is straightforward using tools such as Equatio, Brightspace, and Office.

A first step to accessible and inclusive access is to present information in multiple ways. For STEM content, consider presenting:

1.      Numerically

2.      Verbally

3.      Graphically

4.      In multiple formats

[]

1.      Lay out the equation line by line, step by step.

2.      In digital spaces, insert symbols using equation editors instead of copying from elsewhere.

[]

Accessible Math

1.      Read the equation or data aloud.

2.      Explain the steps and processes as you complete them. Don’t simply say “this equation here” or “on this line”.

[]

1.      Use an accessible graphing tool such as Desmos (built-in to EquatIO).

2.      Also include accessible data in table format.

3.      For a simple diagram or chart, alt text may suffice.

[]

1.      Convert handwritten math (such as notes, documents, whiteboard photos) using Equatio mobile.

2.      On a mobile device, navigate to m.equat.io and scan physical math

1. Authenticate using your Langara email 3. Send to Equatio Mathspace on desktop

1. Authenticate using your Langara email

4. Use the Equatio Screenshot Reader (more information in later chapters) to capture math from the web and digital documents.

In digital formats ensure you use the proper symbols. Do not use the letter x or *, instead use the multiplication symbol [] . Avoid / for division, as assistive technology will read “21 forward slash 7”. Instead, include the division symbol [].

Accessible Math

EquatIO

[]

Langara has a site license for EquatIO, which means faculty, students, and staff can log in with their Office365 email and use all features of EquatIO. EquatIO is very intuitive and easy to use. Anywhere you can input text, you can use EquatIO to write math. Anywhere you encounter math, you can use EquatIO to read and copy math. EquatIO handles multiple inputs and outputs including plain text, LaTeX, MathML, and images. EquatIO also has chemistry and graphing tools.

Installing EquatIO

Google Chrome Extension

Download EquatIO for Mac/Windows

[]

Exporting to PDF

While Word is a preferable format, math content may need to be exported to PDF. In that instance, use File > Export > Create Adobe PDF. Never use Print > Print to PDF or Save to PDF.

Such PDFs will be completely inaccessible.

For further information, consider Microsoft’s guide to writing equations and formulas and formatting equations in LaTex and Unicode.

Ink to Math

1.      Navigate to Draw tab.

2.      Select  Ink to Math.

3.      Draw math in box, verify in preview pane.

4.      Select Insert.

MathML (Word only)

1.      Copy MathML from web or EquatIO.

2.      Paste in Word.

3.      Word will automatically render the math in your document.

Additionally, you can use EquatIO’s desktop version to insert math into a Word or PowerPoint document.

[]

[]passing automated accessibility checks rarely ensures complete accessibility of PDFs, especially a document containing math. Best practice would be to create a Word document and export it to PDF, retaining the Word document as a template for future changes and exports. You could also distribute the Word document to those who need it, or best practice would be to distribute both formats to students, allowing them the choice based on preference or need.

OneNote Math Tools 

Microsoft OneNote can also create and read math content. To create math in OneNote:

1.      Open a new notebook.

2.      Navigate to Draw

3.      Use the Pen tool to write math.

4.      Use Lasso Select to drag around your math.

5.      Select Math Assistant.

6.      In the sidebar, choose Fix it to amend any mistakes and then select Ink to Math.

7.      Your math will be pasted as text in your notebook.

8.      Select View > Immersive Reader to hear your math read aloud.

Math generated in OneNote can be copied as MathML for use on webpages or in Word documents.

Math Conversion Tools

As of November 2023, it is not possible to go directly from a TeX document to an accessible PDF. One potential solution for converting LaTeX to an accessible PDF is MathPix.

MathPix

MathPix may be a useful tool for converting LaTeX to various formats including Word and PDF. MathPix is available free (with some limitations) to educators.

To create an accessible PDF from LaTeX:

1. From the MathPix homepage, select Note.

1.      Choose New blank note

2.      Or Upload a .md, .tex, or .txt file to upload an existing document.

1. Note, this may make more work than it saves.

3.      Write, or paste, LaTeX in left hand pane.

4.      Take note of output preview in right hand pane.

[]

5.      Select Export File and choose PDF (with HTML) or DOCX.

To make an existing math PDF more accessible:

1.      From the MathPix homepage, select PDF.

2.      Choose existing PDF to upload.

3.      Click Upload.

4.      When completed, PDF options will appear in left hand toolbar.

[]

Math Conversion Tools

5.      Select Convert to note.

6.      MathPix will display a side by side of LaTeX and potential output.

7.      Select Export File and choose PDF (with HTML).

Some issues persist in conversion. Ensure content appears as intended before exporting.

Use PDF only as a last option as it is an inherently inaccessible format.

Math on the Web

[]

The following video outlines how to use EquatIO to add accessible math to Pressbooks. You can use EquatIO to insert math as an image, LaTeX, or as MathML. Both LaTeX and MathML will be rendered by the MathJax plugin. The principles covered here may apply to additional web content as well.

[]

[]

Consider these sources on MathML:

W3C overview of MathML.

Mozilla Developer Networks explains how to write MathML. How to Make Math Accessible on the Web (TextHelp).

[]

Learn about the LaTeX typesetting system.

The TeX equation editor allows users to build LaTeX math equations even if they do not know LaTeX.

Use TEMML to convert LaTeX math to MathML. Paste LaTeX as Input: and copy Output as MathML.

The LaTeX to SVG tool converts LaTeX to SVG format. SVG image files can be resized without loss of resolution (which is important for math images/images of text). However, you must add alternative text to SVGs manually.

EquatIO can also be used to convert math between formats such as plain text, MathML, images, and LaTeX.

[]

Add the MathJax plugin to your website to render MathML and LaTeX content. Note: Pressbooks and Brightspace already have MathJax installed.

Math on the Web

As an example, consider how this LaTeX =\int_{ }^{ }\frac{x^2}{(u)^{101}}\left(\frac{du}{3x^2}\right)

[]

read the formula aloud to assistive technology. This alternative text is generated automatically by Equatio and reads: “equals the integral from to of the fraction with numerator x squared and denominator u to the 101st power times open paren d u over 3 x squared close paren”.

The most accessible method is MathML or LaTeX rendered with MathJax. This allows user to zoom, navigate within the formula, and hear it read aloud. However, that requires MathJax. For basic math, or when MathJax is not available, an image with alternative text is better than nothing.

[]

Where MathJax is not available, include math as an image. Add the spoken mathematic equivalent as the alternative text of the image. To do so:

1.      Use Equatio to create your math.

2.      Select Copy Math As…

3.      Choose Spoken Text to add the spoken equivalent of the math to the clipboard.

Math on the Web

4.      Paste the description in the alt text field.

Other considerations include:

•    Explain the concept in surrounding text, use the alt text to describe the specifics of the math.

•    Work in a linear fashion from left to right.

•    Use A Handbook for Spoken Mathematics to write out the verbal equivalent of math pronunciation and syntax.

Inclusive Content Delivery

[][]“For     the           audience,                inclusive language demonstrates respect. It communicates that all people are included in the conversation. Noninclusive language intentionally or unintentionally              excludes, stigmatizes, or dismisses people. Inclusive language also changes the perspective of the speaker or writer with the consideration of another person’s world view.”¹

When organizing, scheduling, and getting set up for any type of event budget extra time and prepare for the unexpected.

In-person:

•    Ensure projector/display is working and looks crisp and clear from everywhere in the room.

◦ Check that text is legible at back of the room.

•    Be aware of what is on you screen (background image, open tabs, etc.) .

1. Linda Macdonald, Dalhousie

 

•    Ensure audio from device and microphone(s) is working.

◦ Check how audio sounds at back of room.

•    Is the room accessible: clear aisles, adequate lighting, station without a chair.

Remote/Hybrid:

•    Ensure microphone(s) and camera(s) are working.

◦ Use a neutral, uncluttered background with adequate lighting.

◦ Try to find a quiet environment.

•    Check that screen sharing/presentation is configured and working.

◦ Be aware of what is on your screen (background image, open tabs, etc.)

•    Silence device notifications.

[]

When appropriate, provide copies of your material beforehand. This allows people to follow along at their own pace, use assistive technology more easily, and focus on your presentation instead of transcribing all the information.

General tips when delivering content:

Face the audience or camera and speak slowly and clearly.

This will aid:

•    ASL interpreters.

◦ Address the attendee, not the support worker (such as ASL interpreter).

•    Lip readers.

•    Interpreters, captioners (including machine generated automatic captions).

•    Non-native speakers.

•    Attendees with cognitive disabilities, focus issues.

•    Everyone’s ability to understand, keep up, and comprehend.

Start with a welcome and introduction. Consider including:

•    Territorial acknowledgement.

•    Content warnings.

•    Introduce yourself with your pronouns, even if you personally do not feel it matters. Opening in this way is an immediate signal that you are welcoming and inclusive.

•    Introduce yourself and any other presenters or facilitators.

Outline an agenda and expectations for use of breakout rooms, discussions, questions, etc.

•    Repeat questions and comments.

◦ For attendees (in-person and remote) to hear if not picked up by microphone.

◦ To relay questions from the chat to in-person audience, remote that don’t have chat open or don’t have the screen real estate to have the chat pane open.

◦ Allows you a moment to craft a thoughtful answer.

Pause before switching slides or topics to allow people to digest information before moving on.

Use a mix of passive listening with active engagement. After introducing a concept or example ask for:

•    Feedback via collaborative whiteboard, survey, poll, etc.

 

◦ However, make sure you are using accessible tools.

•    Initial reaction

•    A show of hands

•    Sharing personal experience, etc.

Consider using a variety of formats to keep your audience engaged:

•    Non-compulsory icebreaker.

•    Verbal presentation with a video element.

•    Group discussion, using examples and newfound knowledge.

•    Question period.

•    Next steps exercise or call to action.

Pay attention to your audience.

If people are furiously scribbling down every item on the slides, there may be too much information or might be confusing. Gauge audience reaction to refine and improve. Conclude

•    Conclude your presentation with a summary, call to action, closing thought, take-aways, etc.

•    Ask for questions.

•    Provide contact information for presenters (with consent).

•    Send attendees a copy of slides and reminders or (if possible) links to any notable resources brought up by attendees or in discussion.

[]

Consider, even tailor content to, your audience. For example students, instructors, or other people in the same field will require a different amount of background information than a general audience without any experience in a specific knowledge base.

However, avoid assumptions about your audience. No matter your audience, people want to be included and respected.

Avoid terms and phrases that have negative connotations about a group. Contact Langara’s Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion for more information and resources.

[]

Some people avoid disability topics for fear of saying the wrong thing. We want to emphasize that it is about making a best faith effort and improving.

1 in 4-6 people have a disability. Many people have disabilities but do not disclose or don’t have the required documentation for accommodations or aren’t even diagnosed. Having to (constantly) self-advocate to a person of authority is difficult. A negative experience will discourage students from disclosing in the future. By creating a welcoming experience, you can encourage students to be themselves and feel comfortable.

•    Don’t present someone with a disability as being an inspirational superhero for doing something.

•    Feature person’s whole identity and don’t focus solely on disability.

•    Show them as active and independent in everyday activities.

•    Represent diverse disabilities, remember non-apparent/ invisible.

Avoid using ableist language:

       Avoid:                                                     Instead:

[]          “Disable that feature”                            “Deactivate that feature”

        “Crazy” “Insane”                                   “Chaotic”

       “Lame”                                                     “Boring” “Unexciting”

        “Blind spot”                                             “Lack of knowledge”

          Focusing on disability                            Talk to a human being

Terms to avoid when writing about disability

Person-first or Identity-first Language

Person-first:

Place person before disability or diagnosis.“Student that has a disability. A person with dyslexia. Someone who uses a wheelchair.”

 

 

Identity-first:

However, some people might prefer identity-first, viewing their disability as part of their identity in the same way someone might refer to their nationality or sexual orientation.

“I am a Deaf person.”

“I am an Autistic person.”

In general defaulting to person-first language is recommended. However, if someone self-identifies using a specific term follow their lead. If you feel comfortable, you can ask individuals what they prefer. If you use a term and someone corrects, use their preferred term and move on. Don’t bother with terms like “differently abled” or “challenged” or “special needs.” Disabled isn’t a perfect term, but using 1 imperfect term instead of awkwardly flirting with having a half-dozen awkward terms for a human being is preferable.

Digital Literacy and Access

Consider that not everyone has the same level of confidence when using technology. When demonstrating something, move slowly and deliberately and explain the process.

Also remember that people will have different access to technology, such as different connection speeds, data limits, or devices. Avoid sharing large files and be understanding if others do not have their video on in a remote setting.

Prior Knowledge

Consider that not everyone has the same background information. Take care when using:

•    Acronyms

•    Abbreviations

◦ The first time acronyms and abbreviations appear, expand or explain them. Subsequent appearances can use the shortened version.

•    Jargon

•    Buzzwords

◦ Jargon and buzzwords can be meaningless and may even be intentionally vague.

For example, if someone said “I received an email about the FA.” Does FA refer to a Fine Arts degree or a foreign agent on my local network or a free agent signing or is the email about financial aid or has the Football Association emailed or do I have to respond to my financial advisor? Or, if someone said “in this session my KPIs are holistically orchestrating intuitive quality vectors and professionally expediting integrated methodologies while enthusiastically coordinating opensource total linkage” would you be able to determine any meaningful information?

Intersectionality

Almost no one person is any ONE thing. Making an effort at inclusivity and accessibility will include as many as possible.

[]

Consider the following passage:

[]

2

To summarize, one might say “dyslexia is a reading disorder that makes it difficult for people to spell, read, write, pronounce words, spell out words, and understanding what has been read. Keep in mind dyslexia is often intersectional with other neurodevelopmental disorders.” Consider that presenting content in multiple modalities is good teaching strategy and an excellent way to be inclusive.

[]Best practices for multimodal delivery:

Orally               present   visual information.

However, do not simply read everything            aloud.

Summarize, highlight, and

suggest conclusions as well as reinforcing information. This practice benefits:

•    Blind or visually impaired attendees.

•    Attendees with an obstructed view or at the back of the room or attending virtually on a small screen or phone.

2. For reference, the above animation of text reads as: Dyslexia, also known as reading disorder, is characterized by trouble with reading despite normal intelligence.[1][6] Different people are affected to different degrees.[3] Problems may include difficulties in spelling words, reading quickly, writing words, "sounding out" words in the head, pronouncing words when reading aloud and understanding what one reads.[3][7] Often these difficulties are first noticed at school.[2] When someone who previously could read loses their ability, it is known as "alexia".[3] The difficulties are involuntary and people with this disorder have a normal desire to learn.[3] People with dyslexia have higher rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental language disorders, and difficulties with numbers.[2][8][9]

•    People with different learning preferences.

Replace generic and vague with specific and concrete.

Avoid saying “as you can see here” or “click here” or “select that.” Not to avoid excluding those who cannot see, but because almost no one knows where you are referring to. Provide cues and references.

•    Orient and direct attendees by using familiar terms (like menu, taskbar, textbox) and relative directions (top right, in the bottom footer).

•    Reference specific menus, links, buttons by name.

◦ For example, “open the existing activities menu”

•    Mention slide, question, or figure number.

Describe visuals.

•    Briefly describe screenshots, photos, illustrations, charts, and other visuals.

◦ Integrated description examples.

◦ Tips for writing descriptions

•    Announce when starting and stopping screen sharing.

•    Spell out terminology, names, (short) links. If a common name consider suggesting how to find that specific person when searching.

Universal Design for Learning

[]Using   multimodal presentation, such as text and media and narration will help           learners   understand and      retain       information. However, that does not mean reading out exactly what is on your slides for example. Text, images, and your voice

should all support each other, not repeat each other. Slides should not be paragraphs of text. When speaking, aim to summarize data, highlight key concepts, and impart takeaways.

[]

Word

[]Use Word’s     Editor      tool Inclusiveness refinements to flag potentially problematic language in your content, script, and speaking notes. In a document, click Editor on the Home tab. Look at the Refinements           sections   to explore                your         own unconscious    biases             and perform a self-evaluation of the language you use.

Aim to use more understandable language and organize information consistently. This will increase understanding by reducing ambiguity. In Word’s Editor tool, select Document Stats to view the Flesh-Kincaid score. Learn more about plain language.

Use grammar and spell check for accuracy and clarity.

PowerPoint

PowerPoint has several tools to help create more inclusive experiences.

Use Speaker Coach to practice speaking rate and check for inclusive language. On the Slide Show tab click Rehearse with Coach. After practicing, review the automatically generated results.

[]so         viewers

don’t have to sign in. This method allows viewers to view slides on their device at their own pace and with subtitles and translations. Learn more about Present Live: Engage your audience with Live Presentations.

In the browser version of PowerPoint, move to the View tab and select Immersive Reader. This tool can be used to check how someone who uses text to speech software may engage with your material (however it is not a guarantee of accessibility). It may also be useful for you as a presenter to have your presentation material read aloud to you for editing purposes. Learn more about Immersive Reader.

PowerPoint can generate subtitles automatically. To use this tool move to the Slide Show tab, check Always Use Subtitles. However, if you are screen sharing and you see subtitles, your audience sees subtitles. They may not wish to and/or the automatic captions may not be accurate, so I would not recommend this route.

If you are recording your screen for posterity or as an asynchronous resource and are displaying subtitles, they will be “burned in” to the video and not editable or be able to be turned on or off by viewers of that recording. Avoid this practice.

[]

 

[]Consider an elevator. Most elevators have some form of braille on the buttons. That is not           because             when       the building was built there was a         person     with         a              visual impairment living there. That wasn’t a custom elevator. There is braille on elevator buttons because there could be, at any point in the lifespan of the building, a person        with         a              visual impairment using that elevator.

If you are recording your presentation, your audience is potentially infinite. If you share your slides, someone might follow your material asynchronously. If you put a creative commons license on your material, could it be re-used, remixed, shared with others? Who are all those people and what can you do to make them feel included?

Make content that is accessible and deliver it in an inclusive manner. Like the Braille elevator buttons, accessible content is not only based on immediate need but because someone might also need that in the future.

So, consider your audience but do not make assumptions about them. By considering the inclusivity of your content and presentation, you ensure that everyone is included with minimal othering and maximum independence.

Social Media Accessibility

Web Accessibility

[]Web        accessibility             best practices focus on removing barriers and providing equal access to information and web content. Barriers may be visual, motor, auditory, or cognitive.                Web         design significantly impacts users’ experience and using proper formatting and tools allows all users to access your web content.         The          principles outlined here are essential for

some users, but benefit all including those using mobile devices, different browsers or operating systems, or older hardware.

[]

The best practice for web accessibility is to follow the POUR principles. Web content should be Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

Perceivable

Can all users read and perceive the content? If content is built correctly, all users (regardless of assistive technology used) can perceive what is being presented.

 

To ensure content is perceivable, ensure the following best practices are met:

•    Images have alternative text or alt=”” for decorative images

•    Videos and audio are captioned or have transcripts or both

•    Webpages have semantic order and meaningful context

•    Information does not rely on colour alone to convey meaning or highlight information

•    There is enough contrast between the colour of the text and the colour of the background

◦ Fonts are at least 16 pixels and are not excessively serifed

•    Buttons, controls, and form fields have descriptive HTML labels

Remember, HTML is content and CSS is style.

Operable

Can all users navigate the page and operate any interactives? Ensure:

•    The page is logically navigable using only a keyboard

◦ Check tabindex and :focus-visible

•    The page has skip link(s) and multiple ways to navigate between pages

•    Pages have meaningful and unique titles

•    Pages have demantic structure with regions, headings, and lists.

•    Media does not autoplay

•    Link text is meaningful and describes the destination

◦ Do not use “click here” or “read more” as link text

•    Buttons accurately describe their action

Understandable

Is the content understandable? Ensure:

•    Consistent, predicatble navigation

•    Clear link text and link purpose

◦ ‘Buttons do, links go’

•    Clear and consistent error messages that receive focus

•    Abbreviations and acronyms are explained

•    lang attribute matches the language of the content

•    Buttons and form fields are labelled and instructions provided

•    Complex information is presented in more than one format

◦ Provide chart data in table format, a glossary, etc. where appropriate

•    Write at a level appropriate to the audience

◦ Check spelling, grammar, usage

Robust

Is your web content robust? Can all devices use it? Ensure:

•    Content works across browsers

•    Works on mobile devices

•    Content is responsive to screen size and zoom level

•    You validate your HTML

•    Double check lang and viewport (<meta name=”viewport” content=”width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0″>)

 

[]

Review your web content and consider the following questions:

1.          Are interactions accessible without using a mouse?

2.          Is it obvious where focus is on the page?

3.          Do non-decorative images have appropriate alt text?

4.          Do decorative images include alt=””?

5.          Do charts have accompanying table data?

6.          Do videos and audio have captions and transcripts?

7.          Is the contrast ratio of foreground and background colours sufficient?

8.          Does content rely on colour alone to convey information?

9.          Does the page convey the same meaning without CSS applied?

10.       Is your layout logical and consistent?

11.       Are headings meaningful and follow a nested hierarchy?

12.       Are lists and tables properly formatted?

13.       Do links describe the destination?

14.       Do buttons clearly describe what their action will be?

15.       Are all these elements usable by non-sighted and nonmouse users?

16.       Are you using standard input controls (radio, checkbox, text, etc.)?

17.       Do error messages recieve focus and provide useful information?

18.       Is there an accurate, unique page title?

19.       Is <meta name="viewport" content="width=devicewidth, initial-scale=1.0"> included?

20.       Have you declared a language attribute?

21.       Does all text get larger and remain visible when page is enlarged?

22.       Can users control and stop moving content (carousels, animations, etc.)?

23.       Does content autoplay? (It shouldn’t).

[]

Most web accessibility features are invisible and will not interrupt design choices:

•    Alt text is hidden in code, read only to screen readers

•    Form labels are expressed in visible text regardless and made accessible with <label>

•    Heading tags <H1> are code to provide structure

◦ Modify CSS to change style.

•    Tables: <th> <tr> <td> are coded within the table and do not change appearance

•    Lists: <ul> <ol> <li> <dd> are code to organize lists, but appearance can be modified with CSS

•    Language and viewport attributes are part of your HTML document

•    You can set a different language for part of your page: <span lang=”es”>Hola. Me llamo Pablo</span>. This has no effect on styling

•    Making your page keyboard accessible changes nothing about appearance or design

•    Closed captions, transcripts, and audio descriptions are a user choice

 

[]

Checklists

The Web Accessibility Checklist is extremely useful for initial auditing.

The A11y project provides an interactive checklist to check web accessibility.

Intopia’s              Accessibility            Not-Checklist           is              an            excellent, approachable resource.

Descriptive Audio

[]Descriptive audio presents an description               of             visual elements and action in video. ensures   viewers    who cannot see the visuals displayed can still understand context and information.

Described video includes a secondary audio track synchronized with a video or presentation that provides descriptions of what is happening on-screen. Often included are descriptions of surroundings, speakers’ appearance, body language, and any other non-audio information. The description is added during pauses in dialogue and included as an optional audio track. At this time, described video is rare and not legally required. Key principles of described video Include:

•    Describing what is on screen

•    Prioritizing essential information

•    Using the present tense

•    Remaining consistent with names of speakers and places

Descriptions should not:

•    Explain or elaborate Descriptive Audio

•    Interpret

•    Add opinion

•    Censor

•    Summarize

[]

Many web video players do not allow for additional audio tracks as descriptive audio is not yet required by law. However, the principles of describing visual elements can create a more inclusive environment while presenting. To incorporate those principles, consider the idea of integrated description. Integrated description means effectively describing visual elements while presenting.

The most effective way to describe things is to be specific:

•    Refer to size, position, or unique characteristics

◦ Say: “The bookshelf is about six feet high, and is 75% full of books.”

◦ Say: “I’m going to click on the close button in the top right of the window.”

▪ Many programs and websites will include Tooltips that reveal the name of a button. Hover your mouse over the button until a small popup text appears. That text will be the accessible label a screenreader will hear or a voice control user will say to use that button.

◦ Reference slide number, figure label, etc.

◦ Refer to “the image of a horse in the top left” or “question number three”.

•    Spell complex words out letter by letter. This will aid all Descriptive Audio

participants with understanding and comprehension.

•    Identify yourself and other speakers

◦ Use your own comfort level, but consider introducing yourself and describing yourself.

Try to be concise and direct while including all relevant information.

Descriptive Audio

EPUB

[]EPUB documents give extraordinary control and customization options to readers.

EPUB   documents              allow readers to:

•    Change background colour

•    Change font style and size

•    Add bookmarks and highlights

•    Navigate by table of contents

•    Pick up where they left off

•    Change spacing and alignment

•    Use text to speech

•    Go to page using source (physical book) page numbers, regardless of how EPUB displays material on device

◦ No need to convert page numbers between physical and digital copies of book

•    Move between chapters or sections

EPUB documents automatically reflow, so when a reader zooms in (or reads a document on a small screen) there is no need for horizontal scrolling. Making a PDF reflow is possible (and results may be inconsistent) but requires additional work and knowledge.

EPUB documents can contain multimedia, such as audio and video files and interactive elements like links.

EPUB

EPUBs are very secure. EPUB is a format for distributing a final version. EPUBs are not meant for documents that will be changed by another party; they are for consumption only. When applicable, prefer EPUBs over PDFs for sharing final versions of material.

The simplest way to make an EPUB file is to export a Word document using WordToEPUB from The DAISY Consortium. EPUB files can be made from InDesign as well.

There are a number of free EPUB readers:

1.      Google Play Books

2.      Apple Books

3.      Thorium Reader (desktop) 4. Calibre (desktop)

InDesign Accessibility

[]

[]

By focusing on a few key steps, InDesign documents can be made accessible at the source. Ensuring accessible InDesign documents will save time and effort when exporting InDesign documents to other formats such as EPUB or PDF.

[]

Metadata helps assistive technology announce content to users and know what language to expect. Add metadata to documents by navigating to File > Info and including a document title and language. Other metadata will help you and others in searching for files.

To create accessible headings in InDesign:

1.      Under the Type menu, open the Paragraph Styles panel

2.      Select New Style

3.      Double click on the newly created style to open the Style Editor

4.      Assign a name under General > Style Name

1.      Best practice would be to name it H1, H2, etc. as appropriate

5.      Modify the style’s visual appearance (font, font size, etc.) in Character format tabs.

6.      In the Export Tagging category, use PDF Tag menu to set as appropriate

1.      Set paragraphs to P

Note-taking and Transcription

[]

Few        people       have       been       taught       how     to      take        notes.

Unfortunately, instructing students how to take notes is no one’s responsibility. If a student does not understand how to take and interpret notes, no amount of technology or accommodation will be useful. Langara’s Academic Success Centre has resources, workshops, and tutoring that may assist students with note-taking

Consider these free tools for note-taking:

Microsoft                                 Microsoft        Word               Google Docs (File

OneNote                              (Select          File           > >        New      >       From

Apple Notes New/New from document gallery Google Keep Template > Notes) > Class notes)

[]

Popular note-taking methods include:

Outline notes are bullet points that mimic the organization of the material or presentation.

Cornell notes organize material using a template (Word, Google Docs Template).

Sentence notetaking involves writing a sentence for each point and organizing material once the overall structure is clear.

Mapping is a visual style that emphasizes major concepts and connections between ideas. Consider MindMeister, Inspiration or OneNote.

Boxing is a visual style that organizes material with boxes around each subtopic.

Learn more about notetaking strategies.

[]

Record and Transcribe

One method for notetaking is to record audio and transcribe the recording later. While this does not allow students to correct and annotate the transcript in real-time, it may be a better solution for students that struggle with focus. This method is also better suited for lectures and presentations as the recorder can be placed near the speaker or presenter. To record audio:

1.      On a digital recorder, press the record button to begin capturing audio.

1.      Users should familiarize themselves with additional features such as sound modes and recording levels.

2.      To record audio on a smart device:

1.      Use an audio recording application.

1.      Voice Recorder is the default app on Samsung devices and Recorder is the default on Google devices.

2.      Voice Memos is the default app on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

3.      Voice Recorder is the default app for Windows.

2.      Begin recording.

3.      When done recording, press Stop. Then transfer the recording to a computer. For a digital recorder, use the included connector and for a Smart Device consider cloud storage (such as OneDrive, iCloud, or Google Drive) or emailing the audio file to yourself.

[]

Dragon Naturally Speaking can transcribe .wav, .mp3, and .m4a file types to text.

1. Open Tools menu and select Transcribe Recording.

[]

1.      If the recording is of someone else’s voice, select Someone else in the Select the speaker menu.

2.      By default, the Output text file location will be the same as the Input audio file location.

3.      Wait for the transcription process to complete. Dragon creates a text file that can be opened in DragonPad or Word or saved for later as an .RTF text file.

Live Note-taking and Transcription

An increasingly popular technology-based notetaking solution are live transcription and notetaking platforms. These tools record and transcribe audio in that users can amend and annotate in real-time.

As the audio is recorded by the user’s device, these solutions may not work in large lectures or noisy environments due to space between speaker and microphone, background noise, and echoes. Live transcription options work best for small meetings, seminars, or group work.

Voice Control

[]

Dragon is software that allows for dictating text and operating a computer using voice commands.

Setup

Dragon Quickstart Guide.

Use an external microphone to cut down on background noise and ensure maximum accuracy in dictation and voice commands. Make sure microphone is plugged in before starting Dragon. To ensure Dragon is using the correct microphone source:

1.      Open Profile menu.

2.      Choose Manage Dictation Sources…

[]

4. Click Finish.

If using Dragon on the web (Brightspace, O365, Google Docs, etc.) install Dragon extension for Chrome.

When first using Dragon, set up a user profile. Dragon will walk users through setting up a profile, adjusting the microphone, and tuning the software to their voice. After creating a profile, Dragon will automatically open an interactive tutorial. This tutorial is recommended for new users and introduces basic Dragon features, dictation, correction, and editing.

Basic Functions

To turn Dragon on or off:

1.       When the speaker icon is red, Dragon is not listening. Click the icon to start Dragon.

[]

2.       When the speaker icon is green, Dragon is listening and will transcribe what is said.

[]

3.       Click the green icon to stop Dragon.

4.       When dictating, say “go to sleep” and the icon will turn blue. Dragon is in sleep mode and won’t transcribe what is said. Say “wake up” or click the icon to continue using Dragon to transcribing speech.

[]

5.       On a desktop computer, press the + key beside the number pad to toggle the microphone on and off.

In addition to using the Help menu, users can say “Dragon learning center” or “What can I say?”

Dictation

[]

1.       Ensure the blinking text cursor is in the area you want to dictate text.

2.       Activate Dragon.

3.       Begin speaking.

4.       Text will be transcribed directly into the text field selected.

DragonPad 

Open DragonPad by saying “Open DragonPad” or by selecting Tools > DragonPad…

[]

DragonPad can be used as a basic word processor. Users can save in common formats from DragonPad or copy and paste into other programs.

Dictation Box 

Open Dictation Box  by saying “Open Dictation Box” or by pressing Control Shift d or by selecting Tools > Dictation Box…

[]

To use Dictation Box the mouse cursor must be in the field where text is to be entered.

When using Dictation Box, select and copy (using right-click

> Copy or Control c) all dictated content then paste (right-click > Paste or Control v) in appropriate field to avoid possibility of losing dictated text with Transfer tool. Very rarely the built-in Transfer button will not work and dictated content could be lost.

[]

Speak naturally as Dragon transcribes more accurately when there are as few pauses as possible.

To add punctuation, say:

•    “Period” or “full stop”

•    “Comma,” “exclamation mark,” or “question mark.”

•    “open paren,” “close paren,” “open quote,” “close quote”

•    “at sign,” “plus sign,” “underscore,” “semi colon,” etc.

•    After transcribing text, say “bullet that,” “bold that,” or

“underline that.”

•    Say “new line” and “new paragraph” to move to a new line.

To delete transcribed text, say:

•    “delete that” or “undo that” to delete last transcribed text.

•    “delete last (number) words” to delete the last (number) of words.

•    “delete last line”

If Dragon makes a spelling error, say “correct that.” If the correct word appears in the menu, select it to automatically replace the incorrect word with the correct one. If the correct word does not appear in the menu, say “spell that” and spell the word letter by letter.

Vocabulary Editor 

Vocabulary Editorallows users to search for terms and refine Dragon’s speech recognition. Select Vocabulary on DragonBar to access vocabulary tools such as Learn from, Add new word or phrase, and Vocabulary editor. Users can personalize Dragon’s dictation by navigating to Help > Improve my accuracy.

JAWS (Job Access With Speech) is the most popular screen reader software. JAWS is available only for Windows but allows almost every function of Windows to be performed with only the use of a keyboard and audio feedback. JAWS is a very expensive (~$1000USD) and complicated piece of software, but indispensable for blind or low-vision students. Download JAWS from Freedom Scientific.

This guide uses JAWS to indicate the modifier key, which could be either Caps Lock or Insert depending on user’s computer and keyboard layout.

[]Speech history (last 100 items read by JAWS)     JAWS Space, then H This is not an extensive list of JAWS keystrokes.

Virtual Viewer

Press JAWS Alt W to open the virtual viewer of the current window. This provides all the text on screen in a line-by-line format that may be easier to navigate or review for messages or codes.

Press JAWS Shift V to open the virtual viewer of the current control, such as a popup or notification. This provides all the text in the in the current control in a line-by-line format that by easier to navigate or review for messages or codes.

Forms Mode

When navigating into a properly coded form (on the web, in a PDF) JAWS switches to Forms mode, a sound will play indicating the change. This mode disables many JAWS keystrokes so users can enter text into the form. If users need to enter forms mode press Enter when focused on a form field and press Number pad plus (which may be function ? on laptop keyboards) to exit forms mode.

PDFs

A properly tagged PDF can be navigated by a JAWS user just like they navigate a webpage using headings (press h), tables (press t), and links (press JAWS F7). PDFs can be awkward to read with JAWS. Try pressing Alt Tab until the PDF is focused and press JAWS b to begin reading the current window.

Convenient OCR

If JAWS indicates a PDF is empty, it likely means it is an inaccessible PDF (image of text). JAWS has a built in optical character recognition tool to extract text from an image and display it in a format readable by JAWS users. To use Convenient OCR:

1.      Open a PDF

2.      JAWS should indicate if the PDF is inaccessible and prompt users to use Convenient OCR. Tab to Yes and press Enter.

3.      If JAWS does not prompt the user, or the dialogue is accidentally closed, press JAWS Spacebar, then o followed by d. This will start the Convenient OCR tool.

4.      When the document is displayed in JAWS Virtual Viewer, press Tab to Open in Word and press Enter to view the document in Word.

PlaceMarkers

For frequently visited websites, users may consider using placemarkers for efficient navigation. Move to the place on the page users want to return to and press Control Shift k and then Enter on the Add button. When returning to the page, press k to cycle through placemarkers or press Control Shift k to see list of placemarkers.

Ignore next key press

When encountering something that should be keyboard navigable (for example instructions read “press left or right arrow to move through content) press JAWS 3 then left or right arrow. JAWS 3 tells JAWS to ignore the next key press and allows navigation of web content as if JAWS weren’t running.

General Windows Keyboard Commands

In addition to JAWs commands, there are some Windows keyboard shortcuts that may help users.

Control f to search in a webpage/document.

Alt Tab to move between open windows.

Windows d moves to desktop. From desktop Windows D moves focus back to previous window.

Windows t moves to taskbar. Windows and number opens/ moves to that taskbar item.

My Computer My Way is an online interface that assists users to use built-in tools and modify settings on their device(s) to make them easier to use. The site helps users filter by need, symptoms, condition, and device to find step by step instructions to adapt their phone, tablet, or computer to be easier to use. My Computer My Way includes basic guides, examples, and detailed instructions for activating and using accessibility features built-in to consumer devices.

My Computer My Way is a web interface available at https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/ By default, My Computer My Way will automatically detect the user’s device and operating system to display tools and settings specific to that device. To research other operating systems and devices or when assisting others, change the Operating system filter to the appropriate device and operating system.

[]

Filters

By default, My Computer My Way will detect the user’s device and operating system. To research other devices or when assisting others, change the Operating system filter to the appropriate device and operating system.

[]

Moving left to right, the first menu is Category which includes: Cognitive, Hearing, Motor, and Vision. Each filter menu can be operated by mouse or keyboard and allows users to search within each criterion by typing.

[]

Each filter allows users to select one or multiple criteria. It is not necessary to select a filter from each menu to use the tool, but choosing criteria will filter down the number of subsequent options.

The next filter, Adjustment, includes options such as captioning, colour settings, keyboard settings, magnify, text settings, voice options, zoom and more.

[]

The next menu, Condition, filters by condition such as common physical, cognitive, vision, hearing, and neurological conditions.

[]

Even when user has a disability listed, use this filter with caution as useful tools may be excluded from results if they aren’t specifically tagged with that disability. This could cause a user to not be aware of a tool that could benefit them.

The fourth menu filters by Symptom. Filters include symptoms such as eye strain, hearing loss, low dexterity, problems reading, and more.

[]

The final menu is Operating System which, as previously discussed, automatically detects the users device and operating system. This menu only allows for one selection, but can be changed to any available option to research other

[]

Clear Filters

Users can remove individual filters by selecting the X beside the criterion to be removed. All filters can be removed using the Clear all filters button.

[]

Search

Use the search tool when returning to a known resource or if a user has high digital confidence and knows the specific terms. However, the My Computer My Way filters are an easier way          to             discover   features   and          tools.

[]

Settings

As My Computer My Way is a web interface there are no settings to change. If users encounter issues, consider clearing cookies and site data. In Chrome and Firefox, click the padlock icon in the address bar and choose Clear cookies and site data in Firefox or in Chrome select Cookies and site data > Manage cookies and site data. Click the trash can icon to delete saved data for the site.

Notable Issues

Beware that My Computer My Way does not include third party assistive technology solutions such as JAWS, Read&Write, Kurzweil, etc.

My Computer My Way is generally up to date and includes older operating systems. This is the most complete collection of user guides for built-in tools and settings that make consumer devices easier to use. However, that does not mean that solutions can be found that are not listed in My Computer My Way.

AT Hive FAQ

Glossary

Accessibility Checkers

Automated tools built-in to many platforms that check for common accessibility issues. Are not to be considered a guarantee of accessibility.

Accommodation

A reactive adjustment to a resource or activity to make it accessible to a person with a disability.

Alternative Text

Alternative text is a text equivalent of graphics in a document or webpage. Alternative text is coded to be hidden visually, but read to a screen reader user.

ARIA

Accessible Rich Internet Applications are roles and attributes that can make Javascript widgets, error messages, and live content more accessible.

Audio Description

Additional audio added to a video that describes important visual details that are not conveyed by the main audio alone.

Camel Case

Capitalization of the first letter of each word in multi-word hashtags. Without Camel Case, hashtags will be read aloud as one long, unintelligible word.

Also known as CamelCase, Pascal Case, or Title Case

Caret browsing

Keyboard navigation using the text cursor to navigate a web page or document. Usually activated by pressing F7 in your browser.

CCTV Magnifier

Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) magnifiers are cameras used to magnify documents or books on a monitor.

Closed captions

A text equivalent of audio content in a video, displayed synchronously. Closed captions are toggled on or off by viewers, as opposed to open captions that are burned into the video and always displayed.

Colour contrast

Colour contrast is the difference in saturation, brightness, and pigment of different elements relative to one another. A contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between text and background     is              required by            common accessibility standards.

Contrast ratio

The contrast ratio between the font colour and the background colour. Accessible contrast should be at least

4.5:1.

Decorative image

An image that does not contain unique information or is used for visual appeal only. Decorative images must be marked as decorative or use alt=""

DOM

The Document Object Module (DOM) represents the hierarchical, logical structure of a document/web page.

EPUB

Most common ebook file format. A very customizable and accessible format.

FAST

A framework for assessing the accessibility of content, by focusing on key criteria, including:

Function

Appearance

Structure

Text Equivalents

Flattened Copy

A digital object that has been "flattened" into a single layer when exported. A scanned document or a PDF created using "Print to PDF" (or similiar) will be a flat image without recognizable text or digital document structure. A flat copy may visually appear as a document, but be completely inaccessible.

Focus

On a webpage, a control or content item that can receive focus by a mouse, keyboard, or screen reader. Typically links, buttons, forms, and menus are focusable.

Focus indicator

A visual indicator of what element on a page is currently focused. This assists users to know where they are on a page and to select menus, links, and buttons with a keyboard.

Focus order

The order in which interactive elements on a page are focused. Focus order should follow a logical pattern that aligns with visual layout.

Functional Accessibility

When something does not meet accessibility standards but is still useable by users of assistive technology.

Headings

Headings are text used to organize a document. Headings are section and subsection titles used to logically separate content, build and show relationships between ideas, and explain the development of concepts. Headings must be hierarchical, not skip a level, and be semantically programmed, not merely cosmetic.

Hyperlink

Linked text to another document or part of document that the user can follow by selecting. Effective hyperlink text should make sense independent of the content around it.

Keyboard trap

When a user cannot navigate away from an interactive element using their keyboard alone.

Label

In HTML, the label element acts a caption for input fields, indicating what a control (form field, check box, radio button, etc.) relates to.

MathML

XML format used to add math to HTML.

OCR

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is software which converts printed material or images of text into recognizable digital text. Scanned PDFs require OCR processes to be accessible. Adobe Acrobat includes builtin OCR technology, but other assistive technology software also employs OCR.

PDF

Portable Document Format. One of the more difficult format to make accessible. Lacks customization options for readers (font customization, reflow, colour options, etc.)

Plain language

Language that is easily understood by the intended audience. Write for the audience using clear, simple language with focus on important information. Organize and group content.

Reading order

The order in which a screen reader reads content on a page. This should match visual order. Reading order also refers to how a PDF will reflow when zoomed.

Responsive Design

Responsive content automatically adapts to the size of the user's display (phone, laptop, tablet, etc.)

Screen reader

Assistive technology software that reads content aloud and helps blind and low vision users navigate and interact with their computers.

Semantic markup

The use of code (HTML attributes, PDF tags, XML, etc.) to distinguish content by meaning, not appearance. For example, a <h1> heading tag creates both a visual and coded navigation waypoint whereas increasing the font size and bolding simply makes regular text appear larger.

SEO

Search engine optimization is the process of improving search engine ranking.

Skip to main content

Often hidden links accessible by keyboard navigation that assist users to skip over repeated parts of webpages or to different parts of a webpage, such as search or navigation region.

Tables

Information presented in a grid format of rows and columns, generally to show a relationship between sets of set

Tag (PDF)

A tagged PDF includes semantic information and structure to create an accessible document. This is done by adding tags to the document in Adobe Acrobat.

Templates

Preset document or file format, used for consistency without having to recreate each time

Timestamp

Specific time in video, often expressed as hh:mm:ss

Transcripts

Transcription is the process of converting audio into written text. A transcript is a written record of all audio in media. Captions are synced to the content.

Universal Design

Design of content, software, facilities, and services so that they are useable, without accommodation, by the largest scope of users.

W3C

The World Wide Web Consortium sets web technology standards.

WCAG

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are maintained by W3C and set the minimum standards for web accessibility.
