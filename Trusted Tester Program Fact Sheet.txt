FACT SHEET                                                                         Mar 2016

What is the Trusted Tester Program (TTP)?

The Trusted Tester Program is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of Accessible Systems & Technologies (DHS-OAST) initiative to address key Section 508 areas related to:

1)      Test and Evaluation standardization: Trusted Testers follow the DHS Section 508 Application Test Process that is based on the interagency Harmonized Processes for Section 508 Testing: Baseline Tests for Software & Web Accessibility.  The test process includes the steps required to determine conformance with Section 508 software and web application requirements, using a consistent code-inspection based testing approach.  

2)      Increasing the workforce 508 test skillset:  OAST developed a comprehensive set of training courses for applying the approved testing methods and tools. Students are tested in a rigorous certification exam.

3)      Sharing 508 test results: The test results provide management with an objective tool for making informed Section 508 compliance decisions throughout the IT governance process. Trusted Tester results are centralized in a database (developed and managed by DHS OAST) that can be accessed by other Trusted Testers and sub-agency 508 teams within DHS.

What is a Trusted Tester?

A Trusted Tester is an individual who has achieved at least 90% on the DHS Section 508 Trusted Tester Certification Exam.  

How do I become a Trusted Tester?

To become a Trusted Tester an individual must complete the DHS Trusted Tester online training course requirements and pass the DHS Section 508 Trusted Tester Certification Exam.

What is the Interagency Trusted Tester Program (ITTP)?

To promote the adoption of unified testing with a common set of tools, test procedures, and evaluation criteria across the federal government, DHS is leading the effort to stand up the Interagency Trusted Tester Program (ITTP).   ITTP is modeled after the DHS OAST Trusted Tester Program and is a strategic solution with a three-pronged approach:

1.      Promoting across the federal government common evaluation processes and procedures for Section 508 testing of electronic and information technology (EIT).

2.      Increasing the workforce skillset and capability by implementing a certification program for Section 508 conformance testing.

3.      Creating a central repository containing trusted tester test results that can be shared amongst government agencies to reduce redundant testing.

How can Federal agencies participate in the Interagency Trusted Tester Program (ITTP)?

Federal agencies that wish to implement the Trusted Tester Program (TTP) can initiate a Unified Testing for Accessibility Project (UTAP) at their agency.  In the UTAP Pilot, DHS OAST staff assisted four outside federal agencies with adopting a ‘Trusted Tester’ approach to testing for conformance with Section 508 standards. UTAP is a six stage process that agency stakeholders follow to develop their own design and implementation plans for adopting Trusted Tester.  

Benefits of ITTP:

ü  Stakeholders can interact with, learn from, and share resources with peer agencies that are testing in a consistent manner.

ü  Supports interagency governance for changes to the Baseline Test Requirements, Test Process, and test tools.

ü  Trusted Tester model is Section 508 Refresh ready.   Note: Minor adjustments will be required when the 508 Refresh is complete.
