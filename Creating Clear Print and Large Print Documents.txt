Introduction

By obtaining these guidelines you are demonstrating your commitment to helping people with a print impairment to read your materials if they find reading standard print materials difficult or impossible. 

This guidance concentrates specifically on modified large print suitable for partially sighted people.  However, others with a print impairment, for example with dyslexia or motor-difficulties, may also find such materials necessary.

UKAAF also offers guidance on other formats suitable for blind or partially sighted people such as Braille and electronic file formats. 

The provision of accessible information is a key requirement of the Equality Act which service providers must follow, but good customer service and business practice includes communicating with your customers and staff in ways which meet their reading needs. 

By providing accessible format materials, you not only demonstrate your commitment to equality and inclusion, but also increase your reach and customer base. It therefore makes good business sense.

This guidance will help you and your organisation to incorporate good practice into your business and provide good quality accessible format materials in a timely and appropriate way. 

Who is this guidance for?

This guidance from the UK Association for Accessible Formats (UKAAF) is primarily aimed at anyone producing clear print or large print documents.  It will be particularly useful for people aiming to create accessible printed materials, either for the general public (clear print) or specifically for people with low vision (large print).  

About UKAAF

Definition of print impairment

A print impaired person means a person who has a physical or mental impairment which prevents the person from enjoying a copyright work to the same degree as a person who does not have that impairment, and “impairment” is to be construed accordingly. A person is not to be regarded as impaired by reason only of an impairment of visual function which can be improved, by the use of corrective lenses, to a level that is normally acceptable for reading without a special level or kind of light.

Detailed guidance

These guidelines explain how to produce clear and large print documents. If you want to learn more about any of the guidance below refer to the corresponding note in the following section.

1. Ask the end user what they need 

These guidelines give general guidance for the adaptation of materials into clear and large print.  Individuals, however, will vary in their needs so the ideal is to find out and apply the user's individual preference. If producing documents in large volumes such as bills or statements it may not be possible but always try to meet the user's needs where you can.

Legibility is affected not just by the text size, but also by contrast, typeface, line and letter spacing, and paper colour. It is also affected by the person’s circumstances, for example the lighting conditions when they are reading, or their state of health on the day. Someone may be able to read a short item in a particular text size, but may need larger text for sustained reading, or to use an alternative medium such as audio.

2. Do not enlarge text with a photocopier

It is not acceptable to enlarge a document to A3 on a photocopier. This produces documents that are unwieldy; difficult to read; any inaccessible design inherent in the original is not improved, and it degrades the quality of images and graphics. The information needs to be re-formatted to conform to these guidelines.

This method creates several problems for the reader. An A3 document is unwieldy to read, carry and store, and this may be particularly difficult for someone who gets very close to the page to read. It may be unacceptable because it makes the reader stand out, for example within a school class. If the text is faint or of poor quality, this is likely to get worse when enlarged in a copier, as are graphics and images. Any design features that are difficult for someone with sight problems to read such as italics are not resolved. 

It may be acceptable under certain circumstances to enlarge with a photocopier, for example from A5 to A4, but in this case you should check the document still complies with the clear and large print guidelines. Simply enlarging may not increase the font size sufficiently and will not address other considerations at all.

However, there are a small number of occasions or situations where A3 can be suitable, see ‘paper size and orientation’ at 3.8.

3. Use an accessible typeface / font and appropriate paper

 

3.1  For clear print use 12 point text size minimum, though 14 point is recommended. For large print use 16 point minimum, though 18 point is recommended.  24 point is sometimes known as giant print.

A given numerical text size such as 12 or 14 point will vary from typeface to typeface. For example, Arial 14 point appears larger than Times New Roman14 point. So, although point sizes are used for convenience, they are not precise. A more precise measure is x-height, which is the height of the letter x in the given typeface. The recommended x-height for 12 point is 2 mm, for 14 point it is 2.3 mm, for 16 point 2.8 mm, and for 18 point approximately 2.9 mm. 

However, many people will need larger text, and one option is to produce documents in a range such as 14, 18 and 24 point which will meet many people’s needs, although some will need larger text than this. 

A few people with sight problems prefer smaller print than 14 point. For example, someone with tunnel vision who only sees a few letters at a time but who has good acuity may be slowed down by larger print.  

You may wish to consider including a note offering the opportunity for people to request a different text size.

3.2 Avoid italics, underlining, and blocks of capital letters because they make text difficult to read.

Italics reduce the clarity of text as they distort the standard letter form readers are used to seeing and affect the spacing between letters. Underlining also affects the standard letter form and overtypes descenders. Blocks of capitals can be hard to read as all letters are the same height, removing the visual cues provided by letters with descenders (y, g) or ascenders (k, h), although a few words in capitals are acceptable, for example in a heading. In general, bold text is preferred as a method of emphasizing text.

If the user requires ordinary body text to be bold, an alternative method will have to be used for emphasis. Possibilities include: quotation marks; a larger text size; capitals; or even italics. Italics and blocks of capitals are inaccessible to some users, so these should be agreed with the user. 

Example of italics, underlining, capitals and bold text: 

This is written in italics 

 

This is underlined 

 

THIS IS WRITTEN IN BLOCKS CAPITALS 

 

This is written in bold text   

 

3.3  Use a legible typeface. Arial is a good choice as it is legible and commonly available on computers, but some others are equally suitable. 

Some people will see everything as blurred, or have difficulty in distinguishing fine detail. It will therefore be easier to read a document that has a clear uncluttered typeface, and preferably one in which different letters are clearly distinguishable. Many people express a preference for either a sans serif typeface or a serif typeface. However, there is no definitive evidence as to whether serif or sans serif typefaces are easier to read for most people, and some evidence that it makes no difference. Examples of legible typefaces include Arial, Verdana, Trebuchet, Times New Roman. An example of a difficult typeface is Monotype Corsiva. Some typefaces have inaccessible forms, for example Arial comes in a light version which is not accessible. 

Example of different font styles:

Sans serif fonts include:

 

This is typed in Arial.

This is typed in Verdana. 

This is typed in Trebuchet. 

 

Serif fonts include:

 

This is typed in Times New Roman. 

This is typed in Monotype Corsiva. 

Use a font commonly available on computers

When choosing a font, try to use one that is available on most computers. For example, a font that came with your computer is more likely to be commonly available than one installed or downloaded separately. If you have used a font that is not available on the computer being used to print your document, another font will be used as a substitute. As you have no control over the substitute font, it may not have a legible

typeface. Using a commonly available font such as Arial means that this situation is unlikely to arise.

3.4 Do not use a smaller text size anywhere in the document. For example, page numbers, footnotes, subscripts and superscripts, image captions and ‘small print’ should all be the same size as the body text. For example, scientific formulae or maths equations may need to be in a larger text size than the rest of the content so that subscripts and superscripts can be an appropriate text size. Headings may need to be in larger text to differentiate them from body text.

When transcribing a document into large or clear print, you are doing so to a set point size, for example 18 point. If we assume that a reader requires this size of text because anything smaller will be inaccessible, it follows that all of the text must be at least 18 point. 

If it is important to keep the relationship of larger and smaller point sizes, for example in chemical formulae, ensure that the smallest size matches that of the document as a whole.

Example:

  ------------- ------------------- -----------------------
                No                  Yes
  Superscript   18^(th) September   18th September
                Intersection¹       Intersection (note 1)
  Subscript     CO₂                 CO2
  ------------- ------------------- -----------------------

 

3.5 Ensure a well-defined contrast between text and background. Black on white offers the strongest contrast. For some people, different colour combinations or coloured paper can be easier and more comfortable to read.

Creating documents and images which contain high contrast between text and background will make documents more accessible. 

•      Reversing out type (white on dark background) is preferred by some readers as it also reduces paper glare. When doing this, use a dark background colour with a bold font as white text can appear smaller; or if badly printed the darker ink may start to fill in the white. The text size may also need to be increased to compensate for this.

•      Avoid placing text directly over an image or patterned background as the contrast will vary and the shapes of the letters may appear distorted.

When using colour with text:

•      use a plain coloured background if using text against colour

•      use high contrast between text and background colour

•      using a paper colour with a coloured tint of 10% – 15%, such as a pale yellow, can help reduce paper glare which some people find uncomfortable

•      avoid using similar colours together.

3.6  Do not use colour alone to convey information, as some                                   people cannot differentiate between different colours 

Some blind and partially sighted people have difficulty distinguishing colours of similar contrast or similar tone such as dark blue and black. In addition many people have colour vision deficiency (colour blindness), where they find specific colours difficult to distinguish.

Simple guidance

There are no set rules to ensure that anyone with colour vision deficiency will be able to distinguish the full range of colour in any publications, but following some simple guidelines can minimise the difficulties:

•      ensure there is a good contrast between text and background

•      avoid combining red and green

•      avoid combining yellow and blue

•      avoid combining colours of similar tone such as dark blue and black.

3.7    Use matt paper, as it is non-reflective and helps to eliminate glare from lights. It must be thick or opaque enough to prevent print showing through. 80 gsm is sometimes sufficient but not always. 100 gsm is usually suitable. 

3.8    In general, use A4 paper unless the content or purpose dictates otherwise.

In general, A4 portrait is preferred for standard documents. However, some layouts may be clearer on larger paper or in landscape orientation. For example, using larger paper or a different orientation may make it possible to include the full width of a table, more columns of a spreadsheet, a whole diagram, or a complete map. The greater ease of comprehension this gives may outweigh the general unwieldiness of larger paper.  

4. Label the document clearly

4.1 Include on the front page who the document is from and a title giving the subject matter unless there is a good reason not to do so.  If the document contents has any legal status it may not be appropriate to add or subtract any text.

4.2 Specify the text size on the cover (front or back).  

Many people do not know what size a specific piece of text is, so cannot tell you their preferred text size. It is very helpful to both the user and yourself if the text size of your document is stated on the cover, to provide a starting point for any discussion. If you are printing a document without being sure what the user needs, one option is to state the text size along with a statement that if they require larger text or a different medium they can request it.

5. Use a clear layout to aid navigation

5.1 Use a consistent layout.

Page layout is important to partially-sighted people because it can help them to find their way around a document in an easy and logical way. This can be achieved by using type and images in a consistent way and by using a grid on which to place these elements.

Grids are an invisible set of lines that are used as guides to place type or images in a consistent way throughout a document. These are set when you first create a document but can usually be changed later. These guides can include: margins (the distance of text columns from the edges of the page and from the spine); text column depth; gutter width (space between text columns); position of page numbers; and placing of headers or footers. 

Not all elements have to be aligned to the top line on a grid, for example a chapter heading may appear lower down the page. This is acceptable providing the chapter heading always appears in the same place in each chapter, so the reader knows where to look for it.

Page numbers, headers and footers may appear to the left on a left-hand page and to the right on a right-hand page, providing they are used consistently throughout the document.

 

5.2 Left align text and headings unless in exceptions where convention dictates otherwise.  N.B. right-align numbers in tables to the decimal.

In general text and headings should be left-aligned. This assists a reader with a restricted visual field to locate the beginning of the line easily. Unlike full justification, it also ensures that word and character spacing is consistent. Full justification can lead to large spaces between words which may be mistaken for the end of a line, and conversely text may be crammed. 

It can be acceptable to centre headings where they are used in a consistent way, such as chapter titles or main headings on a new page, although this should be designed with care.

On some short printed materials, it is conventional to centre text, such as invitations or menus, and most partially-sighted people will be able to cope with a small amount of text in these circumstances. 

If headings are to be centred, wider headings that take up nearly the full width of a column for each line will make it easier to find the start of each new line. Short headings will make this more difficult. Therefore, it is important to check throughout the whole document that headings are long enough to make reading them as easy as possible. If there are too many short headings it will make it difficult to navigate the document and it may be necessary to left-align all of the headings. 

It is important that the use of headings is consistent throughout a document to make navigation as easy as possible. For example, by using the same typeface in the same colour, size and weight for similar kinds of information, and by having the same amount of space above and below the heading. There should also be a distinct visual difference between the different heading levels.

5.3 Clearly differentiate headings from body text, and differentiate different levels of heading. Bold text, larger text, and line spacing can all help to do this [see 5.19 for examples]. 

 

Creating clear print and large print documents

 []

5.4 Do not place images to the left of text as the reader may not realise there is any text to the right of the image.

5.5 In general, avoid printing text over an image. If it is necessary, ensure good contrast and place on an area of plain background.

Placing text over images should usually be avoided, as there is normally insufficient contrast between the text and background for the text to be legible.

However, placing text over an image can be acceptable providing there is sufficient contrast for the text to maintain legibility. For example, placing dark text over an even tone on a photograph, such as a very light blue sky may be acceptable, or placing white text over a very dark night sky.

Making text larger and / or a heavier weight will help maximise contrast between text and background.

It should be taken into account that text placed over an image may not be noticed by some partially-sighted people, as they may not expect to find text there.

5.6 Avoid single pieces of information splitting onto two lines, for example: names, telephone numbers, dates, postcodes, measurements and their units.

It is important that items of information are not split across lines of text as it disrupts reading flow. For example, splitting telephone numbers or website addresses across lines of text may make them difficult to read or to remember. 

This is especially important for partially-sighted people who may be using some kind of magnification to read.

Information that includes a combined symbol and word should also be kept together, for example £10.00, 50 per cent,         80 mm, 3 million, 2 x magnification. Hyphenated words should be kept intact whenever possible. Ideally people’s forename and surname should also be kept together.

5.7 Use a minimum of single line spacing to avoid cramped text.

Leading and line spacing

Leading is the vertical distance between two lines of text measured from the baselines of the text.

Reducing leading can make text appear to merge between two lines, or at worst cause letters from different lines to touch or cross, making letter recognition difficult. 

Increasing leading can help with letter shape recognition and improve reading speed. However too much space between lines, words or characters can also make reading harder.

Some programs refer to leading as line spacing.

Word and letter spacing

People read words by recognising whole word shapes rather than individual letters, but to achieve this it is important that the individual shapes of letters are easy to distinguish.

Reducing the space between letters or words, or changing the proportion of letters (by horizontal scaling) is often used to fit more words to a line, but this can make letters run visually into each other, thereby reducing legibility.

It is also important to keep consistent horizontal spacing between letters and words as this helps with word shape recognition.

Text should be left-aligned and not justified. Justification works by altering the space between letters and between words to fit words exactly to a column width.

5.8 Avoid indenting text at the start of paragraphs, but consider using hanging indents in numbered or bulleted lists. Leave space between paragraphs. 

In general indentation should be avoided for the same reason as left alignment is preferable in order to avoid indentation makes it easier to find the beginning of the line. Instead, paragraphs can be differentiated by putting a blank line between them. However, in some circumstances indentation can assist navigation by imposing a visual pattern on the page. For example, a hanging indent in a bulleted or numbered list may make it easier to locate each item in the list. Staggered indents may assist in identifying the main points and sub-paragraphs.

5.9 Keep text horizontal, including labels on diagrams, maps and other graphics.

5.10 Ensure linked items are connected visually. If there is a large amount of space between linked items (for example in contents lists or invoices) it is easy to lose the visual connection. For example, use a row of dots in contents lists, and show cell lines in tables to link the information. 

5.11 Place page breaks at an appropriate place in the text, avoiding widows and orphans.

 

 

Widow

A line at the end of a paragraph that sits at the start of the next page or column. This results in the end of the paragraph being separate from the rest of the text.

5.12 Tables may become difficult to interpret if the text size is enlarged. It is usually easier if the full width of the table is available to the reader, so consider whether changing page orientation or printing on two facing pages may help. Consider whether reformatting would be helpful, for example changing column width or splitting the table into two. Repeat the heading row for any tables breaking over a page. Bold borders for tables can also be useful.

5.13 If enlarging the text size of a document which has been formatted with columns, consider whether you need to reduce the number of columns or get rid of columns altogether so that the line length and words per line are suitable.

If columns are considered appropriate, ensure the reader can easily distinguish between them by having an adequate space between them, and possibly a vertical dividing line, to avoid the user reading across columns rather than down the page.  

5.14 Have adequate margins, especially from the spine in a bound document. Some people need an area of plain paper around the text to separate the document from its surroundings.

Others use Low Vision Aids (LVAs) such as a handheld or video magnifier (CCTV) to further magnify text, and need to be able to lay the document flat.

5.15 Include page numbers in documents of more than two pages to aid navigation. Do this even if the original document does not have page numbers, unless there is a good reason not to have them. 

5.16 Consider including page numbers from the original text as well as the new page numbering, so the reader knows whereabouts in the standard version they are. This can be achieved by including the information within the text [perhaps in square brackets]; or including it at the top or bottom of the page. This can be useful for: anything with an index; text books; novels (useful in book groups); bills (useful if the customer has to phone with an enquiry). 

5.17 Update the contents list to include the new page numbers. If the original does not have a table of contents, consider if this would be a useful addition. Remember, a large print version will be a significantly larger document than the original.

This is particularly helpful if the user needs to view the text at the same time as sighted companions.

The original text page number is inserted in the large print version in the appropriate place, while the large print page number appears in the footer.

5.18 Consider including a line at the header or footer of each page that contains information additional to the page number. For example, this could include section and / or chapter headings. 

5.19 Consider adding navigation aids, for example where the reader should look for a diagram. These could be bold and in square brackets.

Navigational aids are used to tell a reader what kind of information they are looking at, for example how big or bold a heading is will indicate the kind of information that follows. Symbols such as arrows or triangles can be used to indicate if text continues over a page, or is continued from a previous page; or a square can be used to indicate that an article has finished. The specific symbol used is not as important as its consistent use. 

Consistent use of type is important. Similar kinds of information should be presented in the same way. For instance, a hierarchy of headings (A heading, B heading; or heading 1, heading 2 etc. See example at the end of this paragraph) will help the reader to know what kind of information they are looking at. There should be sufficient difference between the heading styles to make them easy to tell apart. There should also be consistent spacing between headings and text.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Example of a heading hierarchy:

          

     Chapter heading           

 Heading 1   Heading 2      

         Heading 3                                                   

         Text                                                              

 

Aids can also include information such as image captions, which need to be identifiable as different from headings or text, for example by placing text in square brackets. These should appear in the same place in relation to their image each time they are used.

It may be necessary because of lack of space to separate a diagram or table from the text it refers to. In this case there should be an indication in the text of where the relevant image is, and an indication with the image of where the text is.

In a contents list, if there is text on the left of the page and numbers on the right, a partially sighted person may have trouble aligning the information, so it is helpful to join the two elements, for example with a dotted line.

When more than one column of text is used it may help to have a vertical dividing line between them. Also, partially sighted people tend to read from top to bottom of the left column on a page then the right column, so if a page is split horizontally with a two-column article at the top of a page and another two-column article at the bottom, you may need a horizontal dividing line or some other aid to separate the two articles.

Example of a Navigation Aid:

6. Consider using templates 

6.1 Consider using templates for frequently required formats as this will make transcription quicker, more accurate, and more consistent.  

6.2 Templates and Styles are invaluable for supporting consistent look and feel, and efficient production of documents in alternative formats. Different software programs may use different terminology, but essentially using a template with built in styles supports efficient, accurate and consistent transcription. For example, if styles are used, modifying the size, spacing and font style of a specific level of heading only

Creating clear print and large print documents

[]

requires one style definition to be altered. Without styles, the transcriber would need to locate and alter every heading individually. Similarly, copying text from a document based on one template into a document based on another template automatically updates the formatting. For example, if body text was Arial 12 and heading text Arial 16 in the first document, copying the text to a document based on a template with body text set to Arial 18 bold and heading text Arial 24 bold would automatically increase the text sizes and bold the text.

7. Check the document

7.1 Check the document layout has been accurately reinterpreted from the original, and ensure the content matches the original. 

8. Use appropriate binding and packaging 

8.1 Bind the document so that it lies flat, has adequate margins, and the binding does not interfere with the text. (See guideline 5.14 for explanation).

8.2 If your binding includes a cover, ensure this is non-glossy to avoid glare.

8.3 Label the package clearly, and in the same size text as used in the document.

8.4 If required by the client, clearly mark who the package is from.

8.5 Make sure the package can be opened safely and easily by someone with a sight impairment. 

9. Get the document there in good time

9.1 Ensure the document arrives with the user at the same time as sighted users receive their copy or by a pre-determined deadline agreed with the customer, and to give ample opportunity to take any action required.

   

Glossary

A3 paper

A size of paper, 420 mm x 297 mm (16.5 inches x 11.7 inches). (Dimensions of the A series paper sizes, as defined by ISO 216.) See ISO.

A4 paper

A size of paper, 297 mm x 210 mm (11.7 inches x 8.3 inches). (Dimensions of the A series paper sizes, as defined by ISO 216.) See ISO.

CCTV

See Video magnifier.

Font

A complete set of characters in a particular size and style of type. For example, Arial Bold 12 point is a different font to Arial Bold 14 point, although they both belong to the same typeface. See Point size and Typeface.

GSM

Weight of paper in grams per square metre (gsm). Typical photocopier paper is 80 gsm; letterhead paper can be up to 120 gsm; a typical postcard is 300 gsm.

Gutter

The gap separating columns of text.

ISO

International Organization for Standardization.

Kerning

Adjusting the horizontal space between pairs of letters to create visually equal spacing throughout the text, aiding the eye to move smoothly. This is especially necessary with pairs of letters that have overlapping space such as AV, WA, LY, Wa or Vo.

Kerning is usually applied to all text automatically to a set of pre-determined values, but some programs allow manual kerning to make fine adjustments.

Kerning is often necessary with larger text sizes and headings where inter-letter spacing becomes more obvious. 

Leading / line spacing

The amount of vertical space between the baselines of two lines of text. Programs apply leading automatically based on the point size of the text, but most programs allow manual leading to make fine adjustments. For example, 12 point text could be given 3 point leading giving an overall leading of 15 point. This is expressed as 12/15 point. See Point size

Closer leading fits more text on the page, but decreases legibility. Looser leading can increase legibility. Leading can also be negative, where the lines of text are so close that they overlap or touch.

Letter spacing / tracking

Adjusting the average distance between letters in a whole word, single line or block of text to give control over line length. See Word spacing

Low Vision Aids (LVAs)

Aids that someone partially sighted may use to make things easier to see. A typical example is a hand held magnifying glass used to enlarge detail. 

Creating clear print and large print documents

[]

Navigation

How easy it is to find your way around a document. Titles and section headings; table of contents and page numbering can all be used to assist document navigation.

Navigation aids

Instructions added to the original document, often in bold text in square brackets; or symbols such as arrows. These either direct readers to specific sections or elements in a document, such as graphs or tables; or they indicate where text runs over a page.

Paper orientation

Landscape

The aspect of paper when the horizontal dimension is greater than the vertical. For example, for A4 size paper, the height is 210 mm and the width 297 mm.

Portrait

The aspect of paper when the vertical dimension is greater than the horizontal. For example, for A4 size paper the height is 297 mm and the width 210 mm.

Point size

The height of a typeface. There are 72 points to the inch, so one point is 1/72 of an inch high (0.3527 mm). However, type sizes are not standard, that is, one size in a particular typeface is not necessarily the same size as the same point size in another typeface; for example, 14 point Arial appears larger than 14 point Times New Roman.

Serif / sans serif

[]Serifs are the small flourishes at the ends of characters in some typefaces. Sans serif typefaces omit the small flourishes (see example below). Popular sans serif typefaces include Helvetica, Avant Garde, Arial, and Geneva. Serif typefaces include Times Roman, Courier, New Century Schoolbook, and Palatino.  E   E

        serif                        sans serif

Subscript

Characters or symbols written next to and slightly below a letter or number. For example, in

          H₂O

the subscript is '2'.

Superscript 

Characters or symbols written next to and slightly above a letter or number. For example, in

     3rd 

the superscript is 'rd'.

Table cell

A table cell is one grouping within a table. Cells are grouped horizontally (rows of cells) and vertically (columns of cells).

Typeface

A set of fonts of the same family design. For example, Arial is a typeface, but Arial Bold 12 point is a font. See Font.

Video magnifier (sometimes known as a CCTV)

An electronic magnifier, usually used to enlarge close work, although distance models also exist. A camera is focused on the item to be enlarged, and an enlarged image is displayed on screen. Typically, the user places a page on a sliding tray underneath a camera, and a magnified image of the paper is displayed on a monitor. It is usually possible to adjust magnification level and contrast, including reversing the colours to white on black. Hand held video magnifiers also exist, with a small inbuilt screen.

Word spacing

Adjusting the average distance between words to give control over line length.
