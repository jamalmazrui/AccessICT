color:white'>When I was a young girl growing up in Brooklyn, New York, in the
1950s, my mother took me to my neighborhood school to register for class. I
remember carefully picking out my dress the night before and my mother pushing
my wheelchair a few blocks to the school, and then having to pull me up the
steps to the entrance as there was no ramp. When my mother went to the front
desk to register me, the principal came out to talk to her. He told her I would
not be able to attend the school because I was a fire hazard; I could not walk
out of the building. I was denied entry because I could not walk. You don’t
have to guess how that made this little girl feel. Even today, it is difficult
for me to recall how painful it was to think that nobody valued my intelligence
for the completely unrelated reason that I couldn’t walk. Instead, a teacher
came to my house two and a half hours a week until the middle of the fourth
grade. In my own mind, there were no barriers to what I could learn or what I
could achieve. But to society, out of sight, out of mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.15pt;margin-bottom:
13.95pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:120%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:white'>Fast forward to 2017, when Darren Walker invited me to become a
senior fellow at the Ford Foundation as part of the foundation’s effort to be
more disability-inclusive in its work on inequality. I was encouraged to focus
on a problem that I had not previously had the opportunity to work on. Having
spent my life organizing with other disabled people, advocating for
legislative, policy, and programmatic changes to promote the rights and
equality of disabled people around the world, I could think of myriad potential
issues to address.                 </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.15pt;margin-bottom:
15.2pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:120%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:white'>We have certainly come a long way from my youth, when disabled
children were denied the right to an education because of inaccessible schools
or because of low expectations for children with any form of disability.
Calling a child a fire hazard and denying them an education is now illegal.
There is, to be sure, no shortage of laws and resolutions purporting to make
disabled people fully equal participants in mainstream life. The 1990 Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) and numerous other federal measures prohibit
disability discrimination in the United States. In 2006, the United Nations
adopted the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which over
175 countries have since ratified and are legally obligated to uphold
(unfortunately, the United States is not one of the 175, but that is an issue
for another day). But, the fact is, both here in the United States and around
the world, disability discrimination remains pervasive—sometimes it’s
insidious, as is reflected in the vastly lower employment rates among disabled
people, and sometimes it’s more blatant, as the rates of violence and assault
perpetrated against them make clear.</span><sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:120%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:white'>1</span></sup><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.15pt;margin-bottom:
13.95pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:120%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:white'>However it manifests, this kind of disability discrimination
amounts to an “othering” of disabled persons. Boiled down to its essence, such
discrimination arises from the inability of non-disabled people to understand,
appreciate, empathize with, learn from, and respect the lives of those in our
diverse community on an equal basis with their own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.15pt;margin-bottom:

style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:white'> In reflecting on the
cultural norms that permit such discrimination to continue, I realized that I
wanted to focus my time at Ford on the role of the media in shaping these
cultural norms. Growing up, I rarely, if ever, saw anyone with a disability on
television or in movies. If disabled people were shown at all, they were
portrayed as villains to be reviled— Ernst Blofeld in the <i>James Bond</i>
series and the eponymous Doctor Strangelove of the classic Stanley Kubrick film
were both wheelchair riders—or as objects of pity for charitable causes such as
the <i>Jerry Lewis Telethon</i> and on numerous soap operas where “good” or
beloved characters were apt to be miraculously cured of their disability.
Without question, there was nobody I could look to and say, “There’s a
positive, high-achieving disabled person like me,” and certainly no one I could
look to as a role model who reflected my actual lived experience. I felt
invisible. Ironically, of course, one of the most inspirational political
figures of the 20th century was a wheelchair rider himself; four-term US
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt could not walk due to having contracted
polio, just like me. But almost no American knew it: Roosevelt and his advisers
went to fantastic lengths to keep his disability hidden from the American
people because of the societal stigma around disability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.15pt;margin-bottom:
13.95pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:120%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:white'>It is long past time for this cultural invisibility to end. Media
companies, from news outlets to Hollywood studios to the leading social-media
platforms, must be held accountable. Disabled people’s stories should be
standard, presented with a frequency proportional to the community’s vast
numbers. We must act—now—to make this happen. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.15pt;margin-bottom:
13.95pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:120%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:white'>Much attention has been given of late to the need to increase
diversity and representation in the media, but rarely is disability referenced
as part of that diversity. As many in the disability advocacy community are
saying, “It’s time to put the ‘D’—disability—in diversity!” Media must begin to
see those of us with all types of disabilities, and from all backgrounds, as a
part of society and as meaningful contributors. We need to see reflections of
both the diversity and commonality of our stories. Representation of the
diversity within our community—including the breadth of apparent and
non-apparent disabilities—and the intersection of disability with other
identities, is very important, not just for us as disabled people but for
families and communities as a whole. Disabled people in film, on television,
and in other forms of media should reflect the reality of our lives—our joys,
sorrows, struggles, victories, and the everyday issues we all face. Only then
will we be able to effectively counteract the themes of our being invisible or
seen only as incapable, a drain, a tragedy.</span></p>

color:white'>This report then is a foray into the world of media, focusing on
television and film. It examines how disability has typically (and
problematically) been portrayed, presents examples of progress that has been
made in the inclusion of disability, and looks for models from other movements
and other countries that have been successful in shifting the way particular
groups are represented in the media. It also provides recommendations to
further the cause of meaningful and realistic media representation of disabled
people. The recommendations in this paper are focused on those within the
philanthropic community—both donors and grant recipients—who are engaged in
effecting change within and across the media. That said, I hope that the
industry more broadly will pay attention to the recommendations and begin or
expand efforts to be inclusive of realistic representations of disabled people.

color:white'>This report draws extensively on a June 2018 convening held at the
Ford Foundation, which brought together a diverse group of people from
television, film, and organizations focused on advancing the representation of
disability in the arts, as well as some of the major organizations focusing on
advancing diversity in the media in general. I wanted to learn what other
minority groups had been doing over the years to speak out against minimal and
stereotypical representation, including how such efforts have been funded. It
was a unique group and as far as we can tell, the first convening of its kind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.15pt;margin-bottom:
13.95pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:120%'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:white'>I am confident that effective implementation of this report’s
recommendations will lead to tangible changes, ensuring that, over time,
disabled people are visibly and accurately represented in the media as an equal
part of the diversity of our society. In turn, I strongly believe that the
media is capable of positively affecting society’s perceptions of disabled
people so that authentic representation, over time, can reduce stereotypical
perceptions of disability and play an influential role in reducing discrimination
and advancing equality. </span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:white'>Disabled people are a
part of every other group in society, and we are the one group that anyone can
join at any age. After 70 years of waiting, I ought to find the disability
experience an intrinsic element of the media’s representation of society. Regardless
of our age, race, religion, ethnicity, or sexual orientation, whether we were
born with or acquired our disabilities, and whether or not our disabilities are
apparent or not, I and other disabled people ought finally to be able to point
to the presenters and characters on our televisions and in our films and say,
“That person’s like me—they understand my life, joys, sorrows, and
complexities.” I want to be able to stop cringing, and with the millions of
disabled people, families, and friends—including the thousands of disabled
people interested in working in the industry— know that our ever-growing and
diverse community is truly being included. There have been endless discussions
about <i>why</i> the disabled population remains on the margins. The time has
come to seriously and comprehensively take steps that will move us from the
margins to the main stage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.5pt;margin-bottom:
16.2pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>We are at a pivotal point in history. Media is
shifting and changing from traditional broadcast and print to the new world of
online streaming and social media. With movements like #OscarsSoWhite and
Time’s Up, the entertainment industry is galvanizing to create change.
Diversity is in the zeitgeist and blockbuster films like <i>Black Panther</i>
highlight the importance of representation and the need to create a world of
inclusion. The economic benefits that inclusion brings don’t hurt either. <sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>2</span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.1pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>However, one minority that is continually left on the
margins of this new wave of representation is disabled people. We saw this with
the #MeToo movement, which has created a radical shift in our society. Disabled
women were only included after activists from the community called out the
Time’s Up movement for not being inclusive of women with disabilities.<sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>3</span></sup> It is no longer
acceptable to not have women at the table. It is no longer acceptable to not
have people of color at the table. But no one thinks to see if the table is
accessible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>According to GLAAD’s <i>Where We Are on TV ’18-’19</i>,<sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>4</span></sup> only 2.1 percent of
primetime broadcast TV series regulars—or a total of 16 characters—have
disabilities. A recent Annenberg study<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:110%'>5</span></sup> found that, across the 100 top-grossing movies
of 2016, only 2.7 percent of characters were depicted with a disability, only
2.5 percent of characters were depicted with a disability over the past 10
years, and nearly half of the films across the top 100 did not include a single
character with a disability. Of those small numbers of characters, 95 percent
are played by non-disabled actors on television.<sup><span style='font-size:
9.0pt;line-height:110%'>6</span></sup> This has critical ramifications for
media and society. Media reflects society and society can reflect the media.
Society has its own issues with disability that it must grapple with. A study
in the United Kingdom found that “two thirds (67%) of the British public feel
uncomfortable talking to disabled people.”<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:110%'>7</span></sup> It is unlikely that the United States numbers
are dramatically different. However, there is evidence that the media can play
a part in changing these attitudes. When London hosted the 2012 Paralympics, a
strong media push by Channel 4 demonstrated that media can make an impact. A
study regarding attitudes before and after the London 2012 Paralympics showed
that this media push was successful in shifting short-term perceptions
surrounding disability, with one disabled person explaining, “There was like a
two-week or something period when it was very positive to be disabled… Suddenly
they [non-disabled people] realised it’s not a scary thing to talk to me… Cause
[the Paralympics] educated them.”<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:
110%'>8</span></sup> Unfortunately, the Paralympics are only every two years,
with the Summer and Winter Paralympics alternating, and we need sustained
change now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>We have seen that the media has the potential to create
lasting change in the hearts and minds of the public with respect to other
minority groups. This is clearly evident in Ellen DeGeneres’s coming out 20
years ago and the subsequent growth in acceptance of the gay rights movement.
As Eric Marcus, creator and host of the podcast <i>Making Gay History</i>
explains: “For everyday people, Ellen made gay OK.”<sup><span style='font-size:
9.0pt;line-height:110%'>9</span></sup> Ellen visited the homes of millions of
people every afternoon, people who may have never been exposed to an LGBTQI
person otherwise. In a study conducted in 2015, Ellen was cited as a more
influential figure in the LGBTQI movement than any politician, even President
Barack Obama.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>10</span></sup>
Imagine if a disabled person could do what Ellen did for the disability
community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>As Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, said in
a 2015 speech at the Skoll World Forum, “The media cannot serve our
representative democracy if it isn’t representative of our democracy.”<sup><span

style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>13</span></sup> However, far fewer
than 25 percent of characters in the media today are depicted with a
disability—and those who are, most often are not portrayed by a disabled actor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:15.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Moreover, media makers do not seem to be cognizant of
disabled people’s absence. Why would they be? The current system is working for
them. According to the film website IndieWire, “59 non-disabled actors have
earned Oscar nominations for playing disabled characters. History suggests that
those nominees have nearly a 50% shot at a win.”<sup><span style='font-size:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Representation of disability in the media should be one in
four, in front of and behind the camera, in characters, in actors, in
directors, in writers’ rooms, and more. Disabled people come in all shapes and
sizes, from wheelchair riders to people with psychosocial disabilities to those
with chronic illnesses. From the Hispanic deaf person to the legally blind
African American who has albinism to the Asian lesbian wheelchair rider,
diversity is intersectional and the media must reflect this. Not only do disabled
people need to see themselves, but their families and communities need to see
disability on their screens. Most people acquire their disabilities as they
become older, so people should be given the opportunity to learn about the
diversity in this community.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>We are seeing small changes. There are now primetime shows

small peek into deaf community and culture.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:110%'>16</span></sup> <i>Sesame Street</i> (which has been on the
air for 49 years with more than 1,400 episodes,) introduced a puppet character
with a disability in 2017, and the character of Julia, who has autism, was
highly celebrated and accepted. <sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:

the best dramas ever on television,<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;

palsy and is played by an actor with that disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>One of the best examples of disability representation was a
recent Comedy Central <i>Drunk History</i> episode highlighting the Section 504
demonstrations in 1977 that eventually led to the Americans with Disabilities
Act in 1990.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>19</span></sup>
It was part of a collection of stories focused on civil rights activists, from
suffragettes to African Americans in the South, demonstrating how each group
simply wanted access to equal citizenship. Every disabled character in the
episode was played by a disabled actor and it illustrated an actual event in
disability history, one that is seldom discussed in mainstream media.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:45.05pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>However, while we are seeing these advancements we are also
seeing movies like <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> and <i>Me Before You </i>continuing
to be made. These films were not written or acted in by disabled people and
they feature actors portraying disabled people who believe that death is better
than living with a disability. There are some disabled people who may share
these sentiments, but a portrayal like this completely negates the experiences
of other disabled people whose lives are valued by themselves and others. The
disability community has pointed this out by protesting both films, yet all
that uninformed audiences see is that <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> went on to win
the Best Picture Oscar and is considered one of the best films of the 21st
century.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>20</span></sup>

underrepresentation and stereotyped representation in the media, and there are
lessons to be learned from the progress that has been made by such groups. To
be sure, there is still more to be done to move the needle for African
Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, LGBTQI people, and
others. <i>Black Panther</i>, with its majority-black cast, just arrived in
2018, as did <i>Crazy Rich Asians</i>. However, while these communities have
had monumental and impactful moments, disability seems to be decades behind. So
how did these groups make it this far?</p>

<h3 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:60.3pt;margin-bottom:14.5pt;margin-left:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In order to outline an accurate history of the Center for
Asian American Media, it is necessary to briefly address the genesis of the
Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). CPB was founded in 1967 to be “the
steward of the federal government’s investment in public broadcasting and the
largest single source of funding for public radio, television.”<sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>26</span></sup>  In 1977, after a
decade of social and political unrest, much of it fueled by racial injustice, a
task force created to evaluate the status of minorities at CPB found that “the
public broadcast system is asleep at the transmitter.”  Congress therefore
began to fund minority group organizations working to advance their
representation in the media—some of which eventually joined forces to develop
the National Minority Consortia. Today, the National Minority Consortia
consists of five independent organizations: Latino Public Broadcasting, Vision
Maker Media, Black Public Media, Pacific Islanders in Communications, and the
Center for Asian American Media (CAAM). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>CAAM describes itself as “dedicated to presenting stories
that convey the richness and diversity of Asian American experiences to the
broadest audience possible.”<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>28</span></sup>
Its award-winning films are seen by millions of public television viewers a
year across the United States. The organization has supported 47 documentary
shows since 2014 and more than 200 films since 1982.<sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>29</span></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:1.4pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>CAAM was founded in 1980, after CPB funded a three-day
conference at the University of California, Berkeley.<sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>30</span></sup> As the organization’s
executive director Stephen Gong explains, “the founding group was composed by
TV and radio producers, a very few of them, filmmakers, community activists,
funders, and educators.”<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>31</span></sup>
At the three-day conference, the creation of an entity that could benefit from
CPB’s policies was discussed, and CAAM was formed later that year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Gong pointed out that “when we started, we were just trying
to find a place at the table, and some way of inclusion. And now we see a much

broadcasting.</span></b><b><sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:111%;

“bringing filmmakers of color together has provided a foundation for

<h3 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:60.3pt;margin-bottom:.25pt;margin-left:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Although the creation of a majority of minority
organizations is a result of government funding from CPB and foundations such
as the Ford and MacArthur Foundations, the LGBTQI community took a different
approach with GLAAD. GLAAD was founded on November 14, 1985. At the time,
coverage of the community and the HIV/AIDS epidemic was often defamatory and
sensationalized.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>35</span></sup>
Unlike groups within the National Minority Consortia, GLAAD was established and
funded from within the LGBTQI community. Over the years, GLAAD has evolved from
a gay and lesbian alliance against defamation to address a full range of issues
in the community. GLAAD’s Senior Director of Education and Learning, Ross
Murray, describes the expanded scope of their work this way: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.8pt;margin-bottom:15.55pt;
margin-left:18.5pt;line-height:111%'><b><span style='color:#146F6C'>“We call
GLAAD the voice for LGBTQI acceptance. GLAAD started as a protest movement in
1985 in response to defamatory coverage of the LGBTQI community, particularly
around HIV and AIDS. Occasionally, we still have to be a media watchdog, but
today GLAAD is much more proactive. We help media outlets tell the story of
LGBTQI people in a way that is fair, accurate and inclusive. We also train
people how to use the media as a tool to build acceptance for the LGBTQI
community in society.”</span></b><b><sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:111%;color:#146F6C'>36</span></sup></b><b><span style='color:#146F6C'>
</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.6pt;margin-bottom:
14.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Acknowledging the importance of media and the role
it plays in shaping our society, GLAAD established the GLAAD Media Institute.
The GLAAD Media Institute enables communities to effect positive cultural
change through media in three ways: first, by training spokespeople and media
engagement education; second, consulting with industries, corporations, and
organizations positioned to take a stand for justice; and third, conducting
research in evaluating data and developing metrics to strengthen their mission.<sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>37</span></sup> Over the past couple
of years, GLAAD has published various reports examining the status of the
field—perhaps most notably, its annual <i>Where We Are on TV</i>, which
examines primetime scripted series regulars on broadcast networks and streaming
and tracks the number of LGBTQI characters through a diversity lens that is
inclusive of disability.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>38</span></sup> 
As explained by Murray, “If they’re all white, gay, men, cisgendered, that’s
not really representation.”<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>39
</span></sup> GLAAD has also learned from other movements trying to make a
difference in media. Murray cites the example of the Vito Russo Test:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.8pt;margin-bottom:15.55pt;
margin-left:18.5pt;line-height:111%'><b><span style='color:#146F6C'>GLAAD’s
Studio Responsibility Index created the Vito Russo Test, based on the Bechdel
Test. To pass the Vito Russo Test, a film must include these three criteria:
The film must include an identifiable LGBTQI person on screen. The character
must have full complexity, not just the butt of a joke and not urban
authenticity. And third, the character has to matter to the plot; if you
removed this character, would the plot change?</span></b><b><sup><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.0pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>We can look to the United Kingdom for examples of to how
disability can become more integrated into television—from programming to
casting to production—and the benefits that can result. Beyond the efforts of
specific channels, it should be noted that there is an underlying regulatory
framework that has contributed to the level of inclusion attained thus far. For
example, in the UK media system, there is a communications regulator known as
Ofcom. Operating under the Parliamentary Communications Act of 2003, Ofcom
regulates television, video-on-demand sectors, fixed-line telecoms, and mobile
and postal services.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>41</span></sup>
Ofcom oversees operating licenses for both the BBC and Channel 4, and its
diversity targets explicitly include disability. There is even a system known
as Diamond that is used by the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky to
catalog and distribute consistent diversity data on programmes they
commission.”<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>42</span></sup>

efforts of two channels in particular —the BBC and Channel 4— offer powerful

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.5pt;margin-bottom:
16.9pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Channel 4 was founded in 1982 to “challenge the
status quo, and appeal to a diverse, young audience.”<sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>51</span></sup> It was only the second
independent commercially funded television franchise in the UK, following ITV
which was founded in 1955 to provide competition to the BBC. Channel 4 is
funded entirely by advertising, and all of its programming is made by independent
production companies.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>52 </span></sup></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Channel 4 has demonstrated a significant dedication to
including disability in its programming. This can be seen clearly in Channel
4’s coverage of the London 2012 Paralympics. (Although the Paralympics
technically falls outside this paper’s focus on scripted media, Channel 4’s
extensive work to make the London Paralympics such a broadcasting success
illustrates numerous lessons of potential relevance to the scripted media
industry.) </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Channel 4 won the bid to cover the London 2012 Paralympics
over competing bids from the BBC and others, with comprehensive commitments to,
among other things, discover a new generation of disabled talent, deliver more
comprehensive coverage than ever before, and challenge attitudes about
disability.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>53</span></sup> 
It delivered, with a 251 percent increase in daily reach during the games
compared to that of the 2008 Paralympics,<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:110%'>54</span></sup> and it continued its support in subsequent
Paralympics as well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>At the end of July 2012, UK awareness of the 2012
Paralympics was at 16 percent. By the end of August it was at 77 percent.<sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>55</span></sup> This is because
Channel 4 contributed significant resources to a major advertising campaign
known as <i>Meet the Superhumans</i>, which aired across 78 channels and
appeared on 2,000 billboards.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:
110%'>56 </span></sup> This campaign’s impact continues to this day. During
multiple research interviews for this project, when sources were asked to point
out an example of good disability coverage, <i>Superhumans</i> was almost
always mentioned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.3pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Moreover, in 2016, Channel 4 held a competition for
advertisers, awarding £1 million worth of airtime to the best campaign
featuring disabled people, with winning ads to be shown during Channel 4’s
coverage of the opening ceremonies of the Rio Paralympics. The confectionery
manufacturer Mars won for its Maltesers brand of chocolates, beating a short
list of other notable brands, including Amazon, Barclays, Dove, H&amp;M, Lloyds
Bank, Lynx, and Purdey’s. Mars partnered with the disability organization Scope,
which assisted in identifying disabled actors to perform in the adverts.<sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>57</span></sup> The resulting campaign
included three ads that featured disabled actors, and it turned out to be the
most successful campaign for Maltesers in a decade.<sup><span style='font-size:
9.0pt;line-height:110%'>58</span></sup> (The campaign was also one of the most
complained about that year, in part because one of the ads, “New Boyfriend,”
was slightly risqué; the Advertising Standards Authority received 151
complaints that the content was offensive to disabled people or of an overly
sexual nature. None of the complaints, however, was upheld by the ASA.) Having
set a target of four percent sales growth, Maltesers achieved 8.1 percent
growth while the campaign was on the air, illustrating that there is a real
economic benefit to including disability.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:110%'>59</span></sup> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:15.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Channel 4 also kept its promises regarding discovering
disabled talent, as at least half the members of the on-air team during the
London Paralympic Games were disabled.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;
line-height:110%'>60</span></sup> Two years before the games aired, there was a
nationwide search with over 300 applicants. Final contenders were put through
rigorous boot camps and work placements in order to provide real world
experience and be sure they could handle the demands of a fast-paced live show.
The newcomers played a major role in the coverage of the games, and 82 percent
of viewers surveyed after the games said they enjoyed the fact that there were
disabled presenters.<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>61</span></sup>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>This commitment to including disability has continued
beyond the conclusion of the Paralympics. According to Channel 4’s Head of
Creative Diversity, “it changes from year to year but a proportion of [her]
training budget is set aside for production talent with disabilities each year
(about 20%) goes directly to individuals or to indies supporting them into
work.”<sup><span style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>62</span></sup> In
addition, Channel 4 features non-sports-related disability content, from dating
shows to late-night comedy shows (such as T<i>he Last Leg</i>), and went so far
as to call 2016 “The Year of Disability,” as the network doubled the number of
disabled people on the 20 most popular TV shows that year.<sup><span
style='font-size:9.0pt;line-height:110%'>63</span></sup> Channel 4 has clearly
taken great strides to include disability on the screen, while also working
behind the scenes to train and support new disabled talent.</p>

<h2 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:138.5pt;margin-bottom:17.0pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>Conclusions</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The philanthropic community has served as an agent of
change through its funding of the projects and work of historically
marginalized groups. The Ford Foundation, in particular, has always strongly
believed in investing in innovative ideas, visionary individuals, and frontline
institutions that are advancing human dignity around the world. Media, as we
know it, is at a crucial tipping point. Similar to the introduction of printed
press, radio, and broadcast television, the lightning-speed evolution of technology
is creating societal shifts through media due to greater access to more diverse
points of view and information. In the Internet age, it is increasingly
unacceptable for media outlets to fail to represent the diversity of the
population. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The disability community is a vibrant mix of all minority
communities. Disability doesn’t discriminate between, race, religion, gender,
sexual orientation, or socioeconomic status. Which is why the inclusion of
disability must be addressed and enforced in a dynamic and holistic manner. In
order for the disability community to make sure that it is not forgotten and
left behind (yet again) as media evolves and changes, it is imperative to have
investments be made to support the disability community’s efforts to stake a
claim in this arena. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.15pt;margin-bottom:
13.6pt;margin-left:.5pt;line-height:103%'><i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:103%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The disability community
needs a central hub that is a hybrid of organizations like CAAM and GLAAD, to
ensure the visible and proper representation of disabled people. It is not
enough to merely encourage current programs to become inclusive of disability.
The disability community needs a space where its members can come together and
work on changing the narrative around disability, and where community leaders
can help nurture and support artists in developing their craft with the support
of both federal and foundation funding. </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:23.5pt;margin-bottom:
28.45pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Currently, the work in this area is limited and
scattered. The burden of an entire movement rests on the shoulders of the few
individuals who have broken into the field. There is need for a sustainable
solution that allows for further growth and development within mass media and
pushes the industry beyond its historic reliance on tokenistic and
stereotypical representations of disability. </p>

it he describes his growing awareness of the problem: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.3pt;margin-bottom:
.2in;margin-left:18.5pt;line-height:111%'><b><span style='color:#146F6C'>In my
own life, I have not been forced to consider whether or not there were ramps
before entering a building, or whether a website could be used by people who
were hearing or visually impaired. In the same way that I have asked my white
friends to step outside their own privileged experience to consider the
inequalities endured by people of color, I was being held accountable to do the
same thing for a group of people I had not fully considered. Moreover, by
recognizing my <i>individual</i> privilege and ignorance, I began to more
clearly perceive the Ford Foundation’s<i> institutional</i> privilege and
ignorance as well.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:15.05pt;margin-bottom:
28.45pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Since the publication of this blog, the Ford
Foundation has begun an internal audit to assess its approach to disability in
its culture and grant making. It has also conducted staff trainings on
disability as a social justice issue, with the goal of incorporating disability
across grant-making processes. Essentially, the Ford Foundation has been in a
learning mode for the past year and hopes to share what it has learned with the
rest of the philanthropic community in the coming years. Ford Foundation grantees,
like the Sundance Institute, are also beginning to include disability in their
work. It is critical that funders not only examine disability inclusion within
their own institutional structure and programming but that they strongly
encourage their grantees to do the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.05pt;margin-bottom:
14.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Nearly one in four people in the US has a
disability. That means a percentage of your community (be it LGBTQI, people of
color, women, etc.) is a part of the broader disability community, as well.
Seek out the people with disabilities (visible/ apparent and
invisible/non-apparent) within your community, make space for their voices to
be heard, and actively support their leadership. As actress Ali Stroker
explains:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.8pt;margin-bottom:14.3pt;
margin-left:18.5pt;line-height:111%'><b><span style='color:#146F6C'>People are
afraid to make a mistake around our community. They want to be careful. They
don’t want to offend. So oftentimes, they love the idea of casting somebody
with a disability but they’re too afraid to have conversations around
accommodations or something as simple as, “Does this content feel
representative of your truth?” </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Before tackling larger systematic changes, a simple first
step is examining our own personal experiences with the disability community
(whether that be in film, television, or our own family and community). By
becoming more attuned to our own explicit and implicit biases regarding
disabled people, we can better formulate practical approaches to enhancing the
realistic and inclusive representation of disabled people in the media.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.95pt;margin-bottom:
14.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>I must give a huge thanks to the Ford Foundation for
its support throughout this year as we dove headfirst into the world of media
and disability. I want to thank Darren Walker for reaching out and offering me
the opportunity to be a senior fellow at the Ford Foundation. Were it not for
Darren’s vision for truly inclusive and diverse programing at the Ford
Foundation, I would not have had the opportunity to work with Ford to advance
the inclusion of disability within the fabric of the foundation and its grant
making. I know that I am quite an unorthodox fellow, who does not fit the
conventional mold of fellows. I am extremely grateful to Noorain Khan and
Kelsey Baker, whose creativity and passion for our work made this activist feel
at home and fully supported at the Ford Foundation. During my once-a-month
trips to the foundation, I had the pleasure of getting to know many members of
the staff. It was energizing to see so many people ask questions and show a
genuine interest in creating positive change. The staff at the Ford Foundation
carry an enormous amount on their shoulders, and have schedules that make my
24/7 work lifestyle seem slow at times. For that reason, I am particularly
grateful to Cara Mertes, Chi-hui Yang, Paul Silva, Farai Chideya, Andrew Catauro,
Marc Climaco, Catherine Townsend, and the many others who took time out of
their busy schedules to become thought partners throughout this journey. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.45pt;margin-bottom:
14.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>This past year has been an incredible learning
experience. This was thanks to every person and organization that agreed to sit
down, Skype, or take a call with us to provide input and share their
experiences, while also considerately acknowledging that these are sensitive
issues. This includes and is not limited to Keri Putnam and Karim Ahmad
(Sundance), Leslie Fields-Cruz (Black Public Media), Bridgit Evans (Pop Culture
Collaborative), Storm Smith and Jd Michaels (BBDO), Lynette Taylor (ASL
interpreter), Beth Haller (Towson University), Day Al-Mohamed (Filmmaker), Tari
Hartman Squire (EIN SOF Communications), Elisabeth Axel (Art Beyond Sight),
Betty Siegel (VSA, Kennedy Center for the Arts), Christine Bruno (Alliance for
Inclusion in the Arts), Ross Murray (GLAAD), and Jennifer Mizrahi
(RespectAbility). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.35pt;margin-bottom:
14.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Throughout this journey, I have had an incredible
rock and touchstone in my advisory group. Those who have heard me speak of them
know that I lovingly call them my “Kitchen Cabinet.” It was this group of
amazing individuals who, on the days that this project seemed too much,
provided warmth and sustenance in the form of thoughtful advice and direction.
Thank you Jim LeBrecht, Sara Bolder, Lawrence Carter-Long, Nicole Newnham, Dan
Habib, Corrie Frasier, Katherine Salinas, and Michellie Hess. Some of you were
there from that first conversation over a meal in the Bay Area that led to the
creation of this project and continued as we all huddled around computer
screens every few weeks from all across the country to discuss this project and
share insights on what is happening in the field. I would also like to thank my
brother, Joe Heumann, for always picking up the phone and answering my random
questions, day or night. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.75pt;margin-bottom:
14.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>I have always found a large part of my strength and
motivation from the community I have spent my life serving and advocating with
others. Special thank you to the disabled artists and allies in the field that
we had the opportunity to talk with who are contributing to what we want the
future to look like: Becky Curran, Jason DaSilva, Reid Davenport, Nyle DiMarco,
Simi Linton, Ali Stroker, Alice Wong, Judith Smith, and Selina Mills.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>This project has been an emotional one for me. Having spent
my life advocating for the rights of disabled people, I take every conversation
as an opportunity to break down larger barriers. This project has further
confirmed what my life experience had already taught me, which is that in any
field there is normally a gaping absence of disability. Pointing out this
absence can sometimes be a particularly difficult conversation. However, it is
leaders such as Sally Fifer (ITVS), Paula Kerger (PBS), and Stephen Gong and
Don Young (CAAM), who remind me that there are engaged individuals who may have
had limited involvement with my community, but are eager to learn and make it a
part of theirs. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Corrie Frasier fell from heaven after Nicole Newnham
recommended her to act as the facilitator for our convening. Our convening
would not have been as smooth and dynamic without Corrie’s passion for the
subject matter, fighter jet pilot execution, and attention to detail. She has
got others engaged in our work and introduced us to many people, including Sam
Howe Verhovek. I will miss our weekly calls discussing our work and her son’s
wheelchair basketball team. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Thank you to Allison Shefcyk, who I first worked with at
the State Department, for the time and care she gave to helping us with
research the background in the early stages of this project. It was a great
help to our small team we began to tackle this large subject. Also thank you to
Paul Schroeder, a longtime friend and go to person when looking at issues of
accessibility around low vision and blindness.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>And, of course, I must thank Kathy Guernsey, who is called
“Saint Kathy” by my research fellows. Having worked with Kathy for more than 20
years, I know she has a unique set of skills that are admired worldwide. Kathy,
you are an incredible thought leader, mediator, and translator: the calm in the
storm. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The Gruesome Threesome. This is a journey I did not intend
to make, as it was my expectation that I would continue my previous work at the
State Department under a newly elected President Clinton. When she did not win
the election, I was out of a job and looking for new challenges. I have always
loved working with intergenerational teams. I am thankful to my friend Curtis
Richards who recommended that I interview Katherine Salinas. Because of this, I
have been working with Katherine and with Michellie Hess, whose contribution to
the development and completion of my Ford fellowship has been invaluable. They
taught me about social media and pop culture, and I taught them about good old
Brooklyn gumption and chutzpah. They came to me with Human Rights backgrounds
and no knowledge about the Disability Rights Movement here in the US or around
the world. This past year has been one of learning for us all. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.4pt;margin-bottom:14.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Finally, to my number one supporter throughout this journey
and many others I have taken throughout my career, my loving husband, Jorge
Pineda, who constantly reminds me to take time for myself, take a break to
spend time with his family in Mexico, and enjoy the simple things in life. It
has been his constant support of my work throughout our marriage that has made
what I do possible. When I turned our home into an office and held conference
calls and meetings, he was more than understanding and his input on this
project has been of great importance to me. </p>
