Introduction

This guide helps screen reader users effectively navigate and use the Microsoft Accessibility Insights for Web browser extension. Microsoft Accessibility Insights for Web helps developers, testers, and designers find and fix accessibility issues in websites and web applications. It offers automated tests, guided manual testing workflows, and specialized tools for evaluating specific aspects of accessibility.

The extension works with JAWS from Freedom Scientific, NVDA from NV Access, and Narrator built into Windows. This guide focuses on Windows usage, though the extension also works on macOS.

Document Structure

This document is organized to follow the typical workflow of using Microsoft Accessibility Insights for Web:

1.  Introduction and installation
2.  Basic navigation and keyboard shortcuts
3.  Using the main testing tools (FastPass and Assessment)
4.  Working with individual specialized tools (Ad hoc tools)
5.  Saving, exporting, and reviewing results
6.  Finding documentation and providing feedback
7.  Appendices with navigation commands and troubleshooting

Each section focuses on a specific page or feature of the extension, with clear keyboard instructions for navigating and using that feature. The document uses consistent terminology and navigation patterns throughout.

Extension Structure

Microsoft Accessibility Insights for Web is organized into four main components:

1.  FastPass: A quick automated scan that checks for common accessibility issues including automated rule checks and tab stop verification. FastPass is designed to be run frequently during development to catch basic issues.

2.  Assessment: A comprehensive testing workflow that guides you through evaluating a website against WCAG requirements. Assessment combines automated checks with manual verification steps to provide thorough coverage of accessibility standards.

3.  Ad Hoc Tools: Individual specialized tools for testing specific aspects of accessibility, such as color contrast, heading structure, landmarks, tab stops, and images. These tools can be used independently as needed.

4.  Settings: Configuration options for customizing how the extension works, including keyboard shortcuts, assessment configurations, and export options.

Each of these components is accessible from the main menu and has a dedicated keyboard shortcut for quick access.

Platform and Browser Compatibility

-   Operating Systems: Windows 10 and 11, macOS (10.14+)
-   Browsers: All modern versions of Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) and Google Chrome
-   Screen Readers: Works with JAWS, NVDA, and Narrator on Windows

The Chrome and Edge versions of the extension provide identical functionality and user experience. There are no significant differences between them.

WCAG Standards

Microsoft Accessibility Insights for Web tests websites against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which are the internationally recognized standards for web accessibility developed by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative.

The current version is WCAG 2.2, which was released in October 2023. WCAG is organized into three conformance levels:

-   Level A: The minimum level of conformance, addressing the most basic accessibility requirements.
-   Level AA: The standard level of conformance required by most regulations and policies, including Level A requirements plus additional criteria.
-   Level AAA: The highest level of conformance, addressing advanced accessibility features.

Microsoft Accessibility Insights for Web typically tests against WCAG 2.2 Level AA, which includes both Level A and Level AA success criteria. This is the commonly accepted standard for most websites and applications.

You can learn more about WCAG at https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/.

Testing Approaches

Microsoft Accessibility Insights uses three main testing approaches:

1.  Automated Testing:
    -   Tests performed by the extension without user intervention
    -   Provides definitive pass/fail results
    -   Examples include color contrast detection, missing alt text, keyboard traps
    -   Found in the FastPass automated checks and parts of Assessment
2.  Semi-automated Testing:
    -   Extension identifies “candidate instances” that might have accessibility issues
    -   User must manually verify each instance to determine if it’s a true issue
    -   Involves human judgment to evaluate potential issues
    -   Examples include meaningful link text, keyboard focus traps, logical reading order
    -   Often includes instructions for the tester to follow
3.  Manual Testing:
    -   User performs specific actions to test accessibility requirements
    -   Extension provides instructions but doesn’t automate the testing
    -   Based entirely on human verification and judgment
    -   Examples include logical focus order, meaningful sequence, sensory characteristics
    -   Primary testing method in the Assessment workflow

Test Results and Instances

When using the extension, you’ll encounter various terms related to test results:

-   Failures: Confirmed accessibility issues that don’t meet WCAG requirements
-   Failure Instances: Specific examples of a failure found on the page
-   Candidate Instances: Potential issues identified by the extension that require human verification
-   Pass/Fail/Not Applicable: Options for marking test results in Assessment

Test Mode is an optional feature that helps with some assessment requirements by modifying the page to make testing easier. For example, when testing keyboard functionality, Test Mode might add visual indicators to show focus states. You can enter Test Mode during applicable assessment items using the “Enter Test Mode” button, and exit it by pressing Escape.
