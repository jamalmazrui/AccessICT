Windows 10 Built-In Accessibility

Features - Quick Start Guide

Overview

[]

The Windows 10 operating system comes with accessibility features that allow for customization of the user experience and interface. This guide instructs new users in how to locate menus to access these built in features, and how to turn them on and off.  

Start Screen

The desktop of Windows 10 is similar versions prior to Windows 8, as it has a desktop workspace with a Start menu. Within the Start menu are many options to view “All Apps” in a list format, browse files using “File Explorer,” or search for specific names within the computer or internet using the taskbar search field.

Built-In Accessibility Features

To find the built-In “Ease of Access” features in Windows 10, open the Start Menu and select the “Settings” icon. Then, select “Ease of Access.” A menu will appear, which includes many accessibility features that will be further explained in the next sections below.

Narrator

Narrator is a screen reader that reads all of the elements on the screen, like text and buttons. The voice, speed and pitch of the narrator can be customized. To turn on narrator, toggle the switch from off to on. 

[] 

After Narrator opens, a Narrator Settings window will appear on your taskbar. This window provides access to many settings within Narrator, including changing the voice, speed of the voice, keyboard commands, and how Narrator interacts with the Windows functions.

Magnifier

Magnifier allows the user to increase the size of items on the screen. To turn on Magnifier, toggle the switch from off to on. 

[] 

A Magnifier Tool, shaped like a magnifying glass, allows users to adjust the strength of the magnification and switch from full screen magnification to a docked bar or a lens following the mouse.

Other features in Magnification include inverted colors, which adjusts all colors to their opposite color to reduce the brightness while maintaining contrast.

High Contrast/Change Background Color

This option allows the user to change the color themese used on the screen, increasing the contrast of features on screen. There are four themes to choose from. To choose a theme, select one of the four themes in the dropdown tab and select “Apply.” 

Themes assign colors to text, hyperlinks, selected text, disabled text and the default background of screens. Colors in the preset themes can also be adjusted by selecting the color box while in the theme menu dropdown box. These changes will apply to Windows 10 screens and within Windows programs (such as Word or Excel), but may not be reflected in all websites or additional applications.

Closed Captions

Closed captioning can be turned on when watching many videos by tapping and holding on the video and selecting the “CC” icon, if available. Users can customize the captioning font, size, color, background, and other characteristics by selecting their preferences in the dropdown menus in the “Closed captions” tab in the Ease of Access menu.

Speech Recognition

Speech recognition allows you to navigate your computer through voice commands. This feature also has dictation, or speech-to-text, capability. The use of a headset microphone is recommended for this feature. The speech recognition menu is found in the control panel, but can be found two ways: 

1.       Search for “speech recognition” in the search box of the desktop’s taskbar.

[] 

2.       Control Panel > Ease of Access  > Speech Recognition  > Start Speech Recognition

Once Speech Recognition is activated, you will be able to state commands into your headset. A Speech Recognition toolbar will appear on your desktop. To turn on speech recognition, either click on the microphone icon or speak in to your headset microphone, “Start listening.”

Within the Speech Recognition menu, users can set up a microphone or headset to adjust for the loudness and clarity of speech, take a tutorial, train the computer to better understand the user’s voice, and view a list of common commands.

Cortana is a digital assistant which receives voice commands from users to provide access to various computer functions, such as setting reminders, playing music, searching for files, or performing searches on the computer or internet. To activate this feature, speak “Hey Cortana” followed by a command phrase. Users can also type their commands into the search field located in the taskbar.
