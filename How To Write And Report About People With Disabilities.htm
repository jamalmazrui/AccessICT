<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:8.95pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines disability
as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major
life activities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:8.95pt;
margin-left:.5pt'>That said, people with disabilities are like every other
human being – they have strengths and weaknesses, successes and failures, hopes
and dreams. Like other minority groups, they don’t want to be stereotyped when
their stories are told. By following these guidelines, you can portray people
with disabilities in an accurate and objective manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:8.95pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><b>Put the person first</b>, not his or her disability. Use <i>person
with a disability</i>, <i>woman with multiple sclerosis</i> or <i>a child who
has an intellectual disability</i>. This “person-first language” puts the focus
on individuals, not their functional limitations. Labeling a person (for
example, <i>an autistic</i>) dehumanizes him and equates a person with a
condition. Think people first, too, for indicating disability groups, such as<i>
people who have cerebral palsy</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:8.95pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><b>Emphasize abilities</b>, not limitations. For example, <i>uses
a wheelchair</i> or <i>uses</i> <i>a</i> <i>communication</i> <i>device</i>
rather than <i>confined</i> <i>to</i> <i>a</i> <i>wheelchair</i> or <i>unable</i>
<i>to</i> <i>speak</i>. In reality, wheelchairs and other assistive devices
represent independence for their users, not a burden. To emphasize
capabilities, avoid negative words that portray the person as passive or
suggest a lack of something, such as <i>victim</i>, <i>invalid</i> or <i>defective</i>.
While the term <i>disability</i> itself implies a negative, it is the most
objective term we have in English.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:8.95pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><b>Do not focus on a disability</b> unless it is essential to
a story. Avoid tear-jerking human interest stories about incurable diseases,
congenital disabilities or severe injury. Focus instead on issues that affect
the quality of life for those same individuals, such as accessible housing and
transportation, affordable health care, employment opportunities and
discrimination. Focus on personal characteristics that aren’t related to
disability, such as artist, professional, mother, etc. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.1pt;margin-bottom:.2pt;
margin-left:.5pt;line-height:109%'><b>Bypass condescending euphemisms.</b>
Terms such as </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:8.95pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><i>special</i>, <i>handicapable</i>, <i>differently</i> <i>abled</i>
and <i>challenged</i> reinforce the idea that people cannot deal honestly with
their disabilities. While <i>special</i> is used in the names of some
educational programs and organizations, the use of <i>special needs</i> is
offensive to many adults with disabilities, who want to be treated like
everyone else in their community. <i>Special</i> also implies a paternalistic
need to be taken care of, which is frequently not true. Just say <i>children
with disabilities</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:8.95pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><b>Do not portray successful people with disabilities as
heroic overachievers or long-suffering saints. </b>Every human faces challenges
in life. Even though the public may find such portrayals inspirational, these
stereotypes raise false expectations for people with disabilities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:8.95pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><b>Avoid sensationalizing and negative labeling.</b> Saying <i>afflicted</i>
<i>with</i>, <i>crippled</i> <i>with</i>, <i>victim</i> <i>of</i> or <i>suffers</i>
<i>from</i> portrays individuals with disabilities as helpless objects of pity
and charity. State the facts in neutral terms, saying a <i>person who has AIDS.</i>
Avoid emotional descriptors such as <i>unfortunate</i> or <i>pitiful</i>. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:8.95pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><b>Do not equate disability with illness. </b>People with
disabilities can be healthy, though they may have chronic diseases such as
arthritis, heart disease and diabetes. People who had polio and experienced
after-effects have <i>post-polio syndrome</i>; they are not currently
experiencing the active phase of the virus. Also, do not imply disease if a
person’s disability resulted from anatomical or physiological damage (for
example,<i> a person with spina bifida</i>). Finally, do not refer to people
with disabilities as <i>patients</i> unless their relationship with their
doctor is under discussion, or if they are referenced in the context of a
clinical setting.</p>

the clinical diagnosis for a genetic neurobehavioral condition that is
characterized by symptoms in three categories: inattention, excessive activity
and impulsive behavior. While the medical community includes <b>ADD </b>(Attention
Deficit Disorder) as a subset of this condition, disability advocates consider
the two conditions as distinctly different. A person who has ADD has difficulty
focusing attention and a high level of distractibility, but does not experience
hyperactivity or impulsive behavior. Say<i> person with ADHD </i>or<i> student

severe limitations in one area with no limitations in others. Use <i>child with
autism </i>or<i> Asperger’s syndrome</i> or<i> person on the spectrum</i>.<i> </i>Do

loss caused by macular degeneration and other conditions.<span

Reactions for those with chemical sensitivities are triggered by low-level
exposure to everyday substances and products including pesticides, solvents,
cleaning agents, new carpeting and adhesives, fragrances and scented products.
Electrical sensitivities are triggered by electromagnetic fields from
electrical devices and frequencies. These conditions are also called <i>environmental
illness,</i> <i>toxicant-induced loss of tolerance</i> or <i>sick building
syndrome.</i> Use <i>person with chemical intolerance </i>or <i>people with

<i>Hard of hearing</i> refers to a mild to moderate hearing loss that may or
may not be corrected with amplification. A person who has hearing difficulties
may have speech difficulties, too, but deafness does not affect mental abilities.
Say <i>woman who is deaf </i>or<i> boy who is hard of hearing</i>. People who
have some degree of both hearing and vision loss prefer the term <i>deaf-blind.

many regard <i>a blind man</i> as a neutral descriptor (the same as <i>a tall
man</i>), and <i>amputee</i> is more often used than <i>a person with an

vision or hearing disabilities, such as when a hospital provides patient
education materials in large print or  a university adds captions to a

environment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:8.95pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><b>Advocacy </b>is an active process designed to make
institutions and social and political systems more responsive to the civil
rights, needs and choices of individuals. Through individual and group
advocacy, people with disabilities can assert their rights under various civil
rights laws and participate in decision-  making that affects them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.5pt;margin-bottom:8.95pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><b>Consumer </b>is the term used by many in the disability
community to refer to someone with a disability.<b> </b>The civil rights
movement in the U.S. inspired the independent living movement of the 1970s,
which maintained that people with disabilities are <i>consumers</i>  of
assistive services and have a responsibility to evaluate and control those
services. On a similar note, some people prefer to be described by what they
use, such as <i>wheelchair user, ventilator user</i> or <i>mental health
service user.</i> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:16.7pt;margin-bottom:
11.8pt;margin-left:.5pt'><b>Independent living (IL) </b>refers<b> </b>to the

nonresidential resource centers are run by and for people with disabilities, as
well as for the benefit of the entire community. Their core services include
advocacy, information and referral, independent living skills training, peer

disabilities.</p>

margin-left:.5pt'><b>Inclusion</b> is perhaps best known for its role in public
school programs, though the concept has a wider significance. It means that
people with disabilities are considered full citizens, with equal opportunity
to participate in community life. As the largest minority in the U.S., people
with disabilities should also be included in conversations about diversity. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.55pt;margin-bottom:18.05pt;
margin-left:.5pt'><b>The medical model</b> is an attitude and practice that
regards disability as a defect or sickness that must be cured or normalized
through medical intervention. People in the disability community prefer the <b>social
</b>or<b> independent living model</b>, which regards disability as a neutral
difference between people – and acknowledges that people with disabilities can
be healthy. In the social model, problems related to disability are caused by
the interaction between the individual and the environment rather than the individual’s
disability itself. These problems can be remedied by changing social attitudes,
physical environments, public policies and other barriers to full
participation. </p>
