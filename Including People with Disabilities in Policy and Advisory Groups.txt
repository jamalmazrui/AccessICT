|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| A process that includes qualified individuals with disabilities in, not token ways, but major significant and powerful ways, can result in exceptional improvements in an organization’s understanding and responsiveness to diverse communities of people with access and functional needs. |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The expertise of health care professionals, emergency managers and planners, and many other corporate, profit and not-for-profit organizations can be augmented by utilizing external qualified advisors with disabilities. Qualified advisors are those who understand and can think through issues from disability, access, functional needs and universal design perspectives. These advisors can help an organization take advantage of the wealth, depth and breadth of information available from diverse disability communities, and effectively plan to include these groups, as  well as prevent making sometimescostly mistakes.

Unfortunately, the history of including people with disabilities has been, in large part, one of paternalism. Entire professions of “experts” have emerged who have taken control over basic life decisions away from people. However, experience demonstrates that people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs can devise creative approaches to remove barriers that have stumped the experts. For example, today’s popular lightweight “sports” wheelchairs were designed by innovative wheelchair users, not by the established wheelchair industry (Kaplan 1992). People with disabilities can be excellent problem solvers and  can offer recommendations that serve the mutual interests of an organization and its customers.

Benefits of involving people with disabilities include:

^(u) Listening and learning about the issues facing individuals with disabilities;

^(u) Understanding the value of accessibility for a very large segment of the population, beyond the communities who self-identify as having a disability; ^(u) Allowing for free and frank discussion between an organization and knowledgeable people;

^(u) Utilizing expertise to develop accessible, inclusive and appropriate programs; ^(u) Providing respectful and targeted critiquing and problem solving to help an organization be more successful; ^(u) Allowing for identification and resolution of issues in a cooperative rather than a confrontational environment; ^(u) Creating a forum for thoughtful people to discuss needs, concerns and obstacles to achieving mutual goals;

^(u) Allowing for the growth of disability advocates in understanding how an organization operates and continues to evolve; knowledgeable and qualified people with disabilities and activity limitations can be one of an organization’s best and most articulate allies;

^(u) Strengthening an organization’s ability to be inclusive of people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs and to better plan, set priorities regarding existing and emerging policies, and determine how to effectively deliver services;

^(u) Evaluating all levels and methods of communications between an organization and people with disabilities; ^(u) Providing insightful input on strategies, tactics, policies, practices and processes to help test, improve and strengthen programs and products;

^(u) Applying best thinking to effectively include people with disabilities; and ^(u) Enhancing an organization’s credibility and accountability with the disability and senior communities.

Who Are Qualified People with Disabilities?

It is important to be specific regarding who is qualified to serve. For example, consider these qualifications: ^(u) Identify as a person with a disability, ^(u) Have a user’s perspective, ^(u) Have personal experience with disability and disability advocacy, ^(u) Can speak broadly on disability issues as opposed to only addressing  personal needs, ^(u) Are knowledgeable about cross-disability access issues (hearing, vision, mobility, speech and cognitive limitations), ^(u) Are knowledgeable about a variety of physical, communication and program access issues,

^(u) Are connected to and actively involved with segments of national, state or local constituencies of disability communities, including such disability communities and organizations that are of, by and with (as opposed to just for and about) the blind, deaf, hard of hearing, learning disability, intellectual disability, developmental disability, independent living, chemical sensitivities, etc.

^(u) Have in place and use communication arteries to facilitate two-way communication with the segments of the disability communities they represent. In addition, other types of experience may be needed. For example, qualified advisors, trainers, contractors and consultants with disabilities need to have:

^(u) Specific technical expertise; and ^(u) Advocacy experience, management experience and training skills.

How to Recruit Qualified People with Disabilities

Avoid Haphazard Random Recruitment

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                                                          |
|                                                                                                          |
| Planning for and not with people with disabilities reflects an old paradigm “a lot about us without us.” |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

When including perspectives from the disability communities in planning, organizations sometimes seek and get less than adequate representation. This is because selecting representatives can be a haphazard and random process where planners don’t take time

to think through the type of representation they need.  It is common for people responsible for recruiting representatives to automatically think of and choose a co-worker, colleague, neighbor, friend, relative or acquaintance that happens to have a disability or activity limitation. Sometimes recruiters call the first disability organization they can think of. These individuals may or may not be qualified representatives.

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| It is important to include people with disabilities as contributors and collaborators, not just as people viewed as patients or victims to be rescued. It is time to revise methods and embrace the approach “nothing about us without us!” |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Pay for Participant’s Time and Expenses and Clearly State Expectations

It is sometimes incorrectly assumed that people representing not-forprofit organizations are able to volunteer their time.  Reimbursement of expenses and providing an honorarium demonstrates that you value these individuals’ expertise and time, and expect full and valuable contributions. Offering a wage-replacement honorarium is especially important for people who have to use their personal time (versus job time) to participate.

Commitment Involves Attention to Details

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

|                                                                       |
| “One thing you can’t recycle                                          |
|                                                                       |
| is wasted time.”               – Anonymous                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Lack of attention to accommodations and travel details; orientation of members; and minutes, follow-up and report-backs on pending issues can show a lack of true commitment on the part of the sponsoring organization. If the effort is undertaken only because it is required, it will show! Use the “Planning Checklist,” “Recruiting Matrix” and the “Agenda and Minutes Template” to assist you in attending to these important details. Take time to think through specifically how your organization can benefit from the efforts involved in successfully sponsoring a group.  Value and use members’ ’ time wisely and present real issues you are struggling with and trying to solve.

Planning Checklist

Use the checklist starting on the next page as a tool to evaluate your organization’s readiness to sponsor or sustain a board, panel task force, work group or advisory council.  Use the listed items to identify areas needing attention and to set priorities. This checklist can also be used over time to track areas of improvement.

     √ Check Not Applicable if the question does not apply.

     √ Check Unsure if you do not know and need to find out.

Summary

Planning for and not with people with disabilities reflects an old paradigm “a lot about us without us.” It is important to include people with disabilities as contributors and collaborators, not just as people viewed as patients or victims to be rescued. It is time to revise methods and embrace the approach “nothing about us without us!” Being diligent regarding seeking qualified representatives will yield positive payoffs.
