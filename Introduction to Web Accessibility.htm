  <meta name="description" content="With raised awareness and accessibility laws emerging around the world, understanding what inclusive access to the Web means is becoming necessary knowledge for anyone who produces digital content. Much of the current information on Web accessibility requires some technical understanding, and may be difficult to consume for the average person. The instruction here will “interpret” the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1), to make it easier to understand for a general audience. You will have an opportunity to experience barriers firsthand, then experience that content with the barriers removed, developing a practical understanding of web accessibility." />

<p>The materials here are intended for a <strong>general
audience</strong>. No previous knowledge of web accessibility is
needed.</p>
<p>The topics will interest those who want to understand what “web
accessibility” means both from a legislative perspective and from an
inclusive or socially responsible perspective, ensuring people with
disabilities can participate in a digital society at the same level as
their fully able peers. The materials here will help you understand what
needs to be done to comply with local and international accessibility
laws.</p>
<p>People in the following roles can benefit from the information
presented here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managers</strong>: Understand what an organization needs to
do to ensure it is serving all of its potential customers or clientele
and is able to accommodate potential employees with disabilities. Learn
compliance requirements to ensure an organization is meeting all local
and/or international accessibility laws.</li>
<li><strong>Web Content Creators</strong>: Become aware of the elements
needed in web content to ensure no potential barriers are being
introduced that may prevent some people from accessing that
content.</li>
<li><strong>Web Developers</strong>: When creating websites or web
applications, know what needs to be implemented to ensure they are
accessible and usable by diverse groups of people with different
abilities who may be using different assistive technologies or accessing

<p>Though we attempt to make all the materials here conform with
international accessibility guidelines, we must acknowledge a few
accessibility issues that are out of our control or are done on purpose
to demonstrate barriers.</p>
<div>
<div>
<h2>Other Accessibility Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some external resources may not conform with accessibility
guidelines</li>
<li>The Lulu’s Lollipops website referenced in <a
href="#chapter-009-activity-1-experience-barriers.xhtml">Activity 1:
Experience Barriers</a> has had barriers added intentionally.</li>
<li>Third-party video content may not be captioned, or may be captioned
poorly.</li>
<li>PDFs have been tested with Acrobat Pro for accessibility though will
be inaccessible to those without the <a
href="https://get.adobe.com/reader" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Acrobat</a> <a
href="https://get.adobe.com/reader" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Reader</a> application or with another PDF
reader installed on their computer.</li>
<li>Flash is used in a number of places to demonstrate Flash-related
accessibility issues. A Flash plugin is needed, and it must be manually
enabled in your browser before the Flash content will appear. This is
typically done through a security icon that appears in the browser
location bar.</li>
<li>Iframe embedding of pages from this resource into a secured site
that uses https may cause clicked links to produce a security error. To
get around this, open these links in a new window. For Windows press
<strong>Shift+f10</strong> when a link has focus to open the context
menu<strong>.</strong> For Macs, after enabling Mouse Keys in the
Accessibility preference settings, on laptops use
<strong>fn+ctrl+i</strong> or for Desktops use <strong>ctrl+5</strong>
to open the context menu, then choose “Open link in a new window.”</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessibility Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Links to other pages of this resource will always open in the
current window.</li>
<li>Links to external sites will always open in a new window.</li>
<li>Use your screen reader’s list headings feature to navigate through
the headings within the content of a page.</li>
<li>Use the Previous and Next links found at the bottom of each page to
navigate through the sequence of pages in the web version of this
resource. To access these links most easily, use your screen reader’s
landmarks list to navigate to the content info region, then press
Shift+Tab to back up to the Next link.</li>
<li>Depending on the operating system and browser being used, font size
can be adjusted by pressing a key combination including the plus (+) and
minus (-) keys. On Windows systems the key combination is typically
“Ctrl+” and on Mac it is “Command+”.</li>

<h2 class="chapter-title">The "Curb Cut" Effect: An Accessible Web
Benefits All</h2>
</div>
<div class="ugc chapter-ugc">
<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>Think about “curb cuts” as a great example of what is often thought
of as inclusive design.</p>
<p><strong>Curb cuts</strong> were originally added to streets to
accommodate those in wheelchairs so they could get up from the road onto
a sidewalk and vice versa. But curb cuts are helpful for many people —
not just those in wheelchairs. A person pushing a baby stroller can now
easily get on the sidewalk. A person riding a bike can more easily get
on the sidewalk where the bike lockups are located. An elderly person,
who may have difficulty stepping up to a curb or who may be using a
walker, now has a smooth gradient and can walk onto the sidewalk rather
than climb onto it. Curb cuts were designed to help those in wheelchairs
but have come to benefit many.</p>
<p><strong>From a web accessibility perspective</strong>, most of the
accessibility features you might add to a website will have that
so-called “curb cut effect.” For example, the text description one might
include with an image to make the image’s meaning accessible to a person
who is blind also makes it possible for search engines to index the
image and make it searchable. It allows a person on a slow Internet
connection to turn images off and still get the same information. Or it
allows a person using a text-based browser, on a cell phone for
instance, to access the same information as those using a typical visual
browser. Virtually every such feature that might be put in place in web
content to accommodate people with disabilities will improve access and
usability for everyone else.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<strong>Key Point:</strong> Think of accommodations provided to improve
web accessibility for people with disabilities as “curb cuts.” Like curb
cuts, they will very likely improve usability for everyone.

<p><strong>Video: </strong><a href="https://youtu.be/jZySw1HSR0Y">The
Business Case for Accessibility</a> by <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ChangSchool">The Chang School</a></p>
<p>Karl Groves wrote an interesting series of articles in 2011 and 2012
that looked at the reality of business arguments for web accessibility.
He points out that any argument needs to answer affirmatively at least
one of the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Will it make us money?</li>
<li>Will it save us money?</li>
<li>Will it reduce risk?</li>
</ol>
<p>He outlines a range of potential arguments for accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved search engine optimization:</strong> Customers will
be able to find your site more easily because search engines can index
it more effectively.</li>
<li><strong>Improved usability:</strong> Customers will have a more
satisfying experience, thus spend more on or return more often to your
site.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced website costs:</strong> Developing to standard
reduces bugs and interoperability issues, reducing development costs and
problems integrating with other systems.</li>
<li><strong>People with disabilities have buying power:</strong> They
won’t spend if they have difficulty accessing your site; they will go to
the competition that <em>does</em> place importance on
accessibility.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced resource utilization:</strong> Building to standard
reduces use of resources.</li>
<li><strong>Support for low bandwidth:</strong> If your site takes too
long to load, people will go elsewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Social responsibility:</strong> Customers will come if they
see you doing good for the world and you think of people with
disabilities as full citizens.</li>
<li><strong>Support for aging populations:</strong> Aging populations
also have money to spend and will come to your site over the less
accessible, less usable competition.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced legal risk:</strong> You may be sued if you prevent
equal access for citizens/customers or discriminate against people with
disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>What accessibility really boils down to is “quality of work,” as
Groves states. So, in approaching web accessibility, one may be better
off not thinking so much in terms of reducing the risk of being sued or
losing customers because your site takes too long to load, but rather
that the work you do is quality work and the website you present to your
potential customers is a quality website.</p>

<p><strong>Video: </strong><a href="https://youtu.be/KWLO80DDW3s">AODA
Background</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ChangSchool">The
Chang School</a></p>
<p>For those studying the materials here from Ontario, Canada, we’ll
provide occasional references to the <em>Accessibility for Ontarians
with Disabilities Act</em> (AODA). For those outside Ontario, you might
compare AODA’s web accessibility requirements with those in your local
area. They will be similar in many cases, likely based on the W3C WCAG
2.0 Guidelines. The goal in Ontario is for all obligated organizations
to meet the Level AA accessibility requirements of WCAG 2.0 by 2021,
which, ultimately, is the goal of most international jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The AODA provided the motivation to create this resource. All
businesses and organizations in Ontario with more than 50 employees (and
all public sector organizations) are now required by law to make their
websites accessible to people with disabilities (currently Level A).
Many businesses still don’t know what needs to be done in order to
comply with the new rules. This materials here aim to fill some of that
need.</p>
<p>The AODA has its roots in the <em>Ontario Human Rights Code</em>,
introduced in 1990. It essentially made it illegal to discriminate based
on disability (among other forms of discrimination). The development of
the AODA began in earnest in 1994 with the emergence of the
<em>Ontarians with Disabilities Act</em> (ODA). Its aim was to legislate
the removal and prevention of barriers that inhibit people with
disabilities from participating as full members of society, improving
access to employment, goods and services, and facilities. The Act was
secured as law in 2001.</p>
<p>With the election of a new government in 2003, the movement that
brought us the ODA sought to strengthen the legislation. The
Accessibility Standards Advisory Council was established, and the AODA
was passed as law in 2005, and in July of 2011 the Integrated
Accessibility Standards Regulation (IASR) brought together the 5
standards of the AODA covering Information and Communication,
Employment, Transportation, and Design of Public Spaces, in addition to
the original Customer Service standard.</p>
<p>The AODA sets out to make Ontario fully accessible by 2025, with an
incremental roll-out of accessibility requirements over a period of 20
years. These requirements span a whole range of accessibility
considerations — from physical spaces to customer service to the Web,
and much more.</p>
<p>Our focus here is on access to the Web. The timeline set out in the
AODA requires government and large organizations to remove all barriers
in web content between 2012 and 2021. The timeline for these
requirements is outlined in the table below. Any new or significantly
updated information posted to the Web must comply with the given level
of accessibility by the given date. This includes both Internet and
intranet sites. Any content developed prior to January 1, 2012, is
exempt.</p>

<!-- pb_fixme -->
<h2>The Global Perspective on Web Accessibility</h2>
<p>While the learning here is being delivered in the context of the
<em>Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</em> (AODA), the
AODA and similar laws around the world are typically based on the W3C
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). As a result, whenever we
talk about AODA from an international perspective, you can think of it
as WCAG.</p>
<p>In this day and age, we live in a global economy, so an understanding
of accessibility laws around the world can be beneficial if you or your
organization conducts (or is planning to conduct) international
business. In many cases, if your organization complies with WCAG and
local accessibility regulations, you will likely comply with regulations
in the countries in which you do business.</p>
<p>Here, we’ll introduce the regulations around much of the world,
starting with North America.</p>
<h2>WCAG 2.0: The Basis for Accessibility Laws</h2>
<p>The W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20">Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</a> are broadly accepted as the
definitive source for web accessibility rules around the world. Many
jurisdictions are adopting it verbatim or with minor adjustments. WCAG
2.0 is used as the basis for accessibility laws that remove
discrimination against people with disabilities from the Web.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #3c3">
<p><strong>Toolkit:</strong> WCAG 2.0 can be dry and time-consuming to
read through and understand. We have created the downloadable <a
href="http://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/iwacc/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2019/06/10-Key-Guidelines-1.pdf"
class="instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file"
title="10 Key Guidelines.pdf">10 Key Guidelines</a> (PDF) that
summarizes and will help familiarize you with the more common web
accessibility issues.</p>
</div>
<p>After reviewing the 10 Key Guidelines, start by learning about the
Canadian and U.S. web accessibility regulations.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Though most international legislation is based
on WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1 was introduced in June 2018. This focus here is on
WCAG 2.1, which includes all WCAG 2.0 guidelines and success criteria.
In time, it is expected WCAG 2.1 will replace WCAG 2.0 as the basis for
international IT accessibility laws.</p>
<h2>Canada</h2>
<h3>Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA)</h3>
<p>Again, the reading and activities here been created in the context of
the AODA, which came into effect in 2005 with the goal of making Ontario
the most inclusive jurisdiction in the world by 2025. Part of this
twenty-year rollout involves educating businesses in Ontario. Any
businesses with 50 or more employees are obligated by the Act to make
their websites accessible by the following timeline: (a) Level A
compliant, between 2012 and 2014, and (b) Level AA compliant, between
2016 and 2021.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> AODA adopts WCAG 2.0 for its web
accessibility requirements, with the exception of two success
criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ontario businesses and organizations are not required to provide
captioning for live, web-based broadcasts (WCAG 2.0, <strong>Success
Criterion 1.2.4</strong>, Level A).</li>
<li>Ontario businesses and organizations are not required to provide
audio description for pre-recorded, web-based video (WCAG 2.0,
<strong>Success Criterion 1.2.5</strong>, Level AA).</li>
</ol>
<p>Otherwise, AODA adopts WCAG 2.0 verbatim.</p>
</div>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #3c3">
<p><strong>Toolkit:</strong> For key information on the adoption of WCAG
2.0 in the context of the AODA, refer to the <a
href="http://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/110191#BK15">Integrated
Accessibility Standards (of the AODA)</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3>Standard on Web Accessibility, Government of Canada</h3>
<p>In 2011, the Government of Canada (GOC) introduced its most recent
set of web accessibility standards, made up of four sub standards that
replace the previous Common Look and Feel 2.0 standards. The <a
href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=23601">Standard on
Web Accessibility</a> adopts WCAG 2.0 as its web accessibility
requirements with the exception of <strong>Success
Criterion 1.4.5</strong> Images of Text (Level AA), which applies in
cases where “essential images of text” are used, in cases where
“demonstrably justified” exclusions are required and for any archived
web content. The standard applies only to Government of Canada
websites.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #3c3">

<h3>Accessibility 2024, British Columbia</h3>
<p>In 2014, the British Columbia government released <a
href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/accessibility">Accessibility
2024</a>, a ten-year action plan designed around 12 building blocks
intended to make the province the most progressive in Canada for people
with disabilities. Accessible Internet is one of those building blocks.
The aim is to have all B.C. government websites meet WCAG 2.0 AA
requirements by the end of 2016.</p>
<h3>Accessibility for Manitobans Act (AMA)</h3>
<p>The <a
href="http://www.accessibilitymb.ca/law.html"><em>Accessibility for
Manitobans Act</em> (AMA)</a> became law in 2013. Like the AODA, the AMA
will be made up of several standards, one of which is the Accessible
Information and Communications Standard, which will govern accessibility
requirements for web content. This legislation is still a work in
progress.</p>
<h3>Canadians with Disabilities Act (CDA)</h3>
<p>Currently a work in progress, the <em>Canadians with Disabilities
Act</em> (CDA) intends to produce national accessibility regulations for
Canada. Visit the Barrier-Free Canada website for more about the

<h2>United States</h2>
<h3>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h3>
<p>The ADA does not have any specific technical requirements requiring
websites to be accessible. However, there are a number of cases where
organizations that are considered to be “places of public accommodation”
have been sued due to the inaccessibility of their websites (e.g.,
Southwest Airlines and AOL), where the defendant organization was
required to conform with WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA guidelines.</p>
<p>There is a proposed revision to Title III of the ADA (Federal
Register, Volume 75, Issue 142, July 26, 2010) that would, if passed,
require WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA conformance to make web content
accessible under ADA.</p>

<h3>Section 508 (Rehabilitation Act, U.S.)</h3>
<p>The purpose of Section 508, which is part of the U.S.
<em>Rehabilitation Act</em>, is to eliminate barriers in information
technology. This applies to all federal agencies that develop, procure,
maintain, or use electronic and information technology. Any company that
sells to the U.S. government must also provide products and services
that comply with the eleven accessibility guidelines in Section 508, as
described in Section 1194.22 of the <em>Rehabilitation Act</em>.</p>
<p>Originally, these guidelines were based on a subset of the WCAG 1.0
Guidelines. Recently, the guidelines were updated to include WCAG 2.0
Level A and AA requirements for those obligated through Section 508.
While Section 508 has been in effect since March 20, 2017, those
affected by the regulation are required to comply with the updated
regulation by January 18, 2018.</p>

<h2>United Kingdom</h2>
<h3><strong>Equality Act, 2010</strong></h3>
<p>While the <em>Equality Act</em> (UK) does not specifically address
how web accessibility should be implemented, Section 29(1) of the
<em>Equality Act</em> places a requirement on service providers.
Specifically, those who sell or provide services to the public must not
discriminate against any person requiring the service. In effect,
preventing a person with a disability from accessing a service on the
Web constitutes discrimination.</p>
<p>Based on Sections 20 and 29(7) of the Act, it is an ongoing duty of
service providers to make “reasonable adjustments” to accommodate people
with disabilities. To this end, the British Standards Institution
(BSI) <a
href="http://shop.bsigroup.com/en/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030180388">provides
a code of practice (BS 8878)</a> on web accessibility, based on WCAG
1.0.</p>

<h2>Europe</h2>
<p>Throughout Europe, a number of countries have their own accessibility
laws, each based on WCAG 2.0. In 2010, the European Union (EU)
introduced web accessibility guidelines based on WCAG 2.0 Level AA
requirements. Next, in 2014, the EU Parliament passed a law requiring
all public sector websites and private sector websites that provide key
public services to conform with WCAG 2.0 Level AA requirements. In
addition, new content must conform to those requirements within one
year; existing content, within three years; and multimedia content,
within five years.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that all countries in the EU must now
conform. The law now goes before the EU Council, where heads of state
will debate. Seemingly, this promises to draw out adoption for many
years into the future, if it gets adopted at all.</p>

comply with WCAG Level AA requirements: government and government-funded
organizations; or organizations larger than 100 employees; or with
trading column greater than six million euros; or those providing

<h2>Australia</h2>
<p>Though not specifically referencing the Web, Section 24 of the
<em>Disability Discrimination Act</em> of 1992 makes it unlawful for a
person who provides goods, facilities, or services to discriminate on
the grounds of disability. This law was tested in 2000 when a blind man
successfully sued the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games
(SOCOG) when its website prevented him from purchasing event
tickets.</p>
<p>The Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC)
shortly after released the Worldwide Web Access: <em>Disability
Discrimination Act</em> Advisory Notes. These were last updated in 2014,
and though they do not have direct legal force, they do provide web
accessibility guidance (based on WCAG 2.0) for Australians on how to
avoid discriminatory practices when developing web content.</p>

<p>To understand where accessibility issues can arise, it is helpful to
have a basic understanding of a range of disabilities and their related
barriers found in digital content.</p>
<p>Not all people with disabilities encounter barriers in digital
content, and <strong>those with different types of disabilities
encounter different types of barriers</strong>. For instance, if a
person is in a wheelchair, they may encounter no barriers at all in
digital content. A person who is blind will experience different
barriers than a person with limited vision. Many of the barriers that
people with disabilities encounter on the Web are often barriers found
in electronic documents and multimedia. Different types of disabilities
and some of their commonly associated barriers are described here.</p>
<p>Watch the following video to see how students with disabilities
experience the Internet.</p>

<h3><strong>People Who Are Blind</strong></h3>
<p>People who are blind tend to face the most barriers in digital
content, given the visual nature of much digital content. They will
often use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen
reader</a> to access their computer or device, and they may use a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refreshable_braille_display">refreshable
Braille display</a> to convert text to Braille.</p>
<p>Common barriers for this group include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual content that has no text alternative</li>
<li>Functional elements that cannot be controlled with a keyboard</li>
<li>Overly complex or excessive amounts of content</li>
<li>Inability to navigate efficiently within a page of content</li>
<li>Content that is not structured (i.e., missing proper headings)</li>
<li>Inconsistent navigation</li>
<li>Time limits (insufficient time to complete tasks)</li>
<li>Unexpected actions (e.g., redirect when an element receives
focus)</li>
<li>Multimedia without audio description</li>
</ul>
<p>For a quick look at how a person who is blind might use a screen
reader like JAWS to navigate the Web, watch the following video.</p>

<h3><strong>People with Low Vision</strong></h3>
<p>People with low vision are often able to see digital content if it is
magnified. They may use a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_magnifier">screen
magnification</a> program to increase the size and contrast of the
content to make it more visible. They are less likely to use a screen
reader than a person who is blind, though in some cases they will.
People with low vision may rely on the magnification or text
customization features in their web browser or word processor, or they
may install other magnification or text reading software.</p>
<p>Common barriers for this group include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content sized with non-resizable absolute measures</li>
<li>Inconsistent navigation</li>
<li>Images of text that degrade or pixelate when magnified</li>
<li>Low contrast (inability to distinguish text from background)</li>
<li>Time limits (insufficient time to complete tasks)</li>
<li>Unexpected actions (e.g., redirect when an element receives
focus)</li>
</ul>
<p>See the following video for a description of some of the common
barriers for people with low vision.</p>

<h3><strong>People Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing</strong></h3>
<p>Most people who are deaf tend to face barriers when audio content is
presented without text-based alternatives, and they encounter relatively
few barriers in digital content otherwise. Those who are deaf and blind
will face many more barriers, including those described for people who
are blind. For those who communicate with American Sign Language (ASL)
or other sign languages, like Langue des signes québécoise (LSQ), the
written language of a website may produce barriers similar to those
faced when reading in a second language.</p>
<p>Common barriers for this group include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio without a transcript</li>
<li>Multimedia without captions or transcript</li>
<li>Lack of ASL interpretation (for ASL/Deaf community)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>People with Mobility-Related Disabilities</strong></h3>
<p>Mobility-related disabilities are quite varied. As mentioned earlier,
one could be limited to a wheelchair for getting around and face no
significant barriers in digital content. Those who have limited use of
their hands or who have fine motor impairments that limit their ability
to target and click elements in digital content with a mouse pointer may
not use a mouse at all. Instead, they might rely on a keyboard or their
voice to control movement (i.e., <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition">speech
recognition</a>) through digital content, along with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access">switches to control
mouse clicks</a>.</p>
<p>Common barriers for this group include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clickable areas that are too small</li>
<li>Functional elements that cannot be controlled with a keyboard</li>
<li>Time limits (insufficient time to complete tasks)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>People with Some Types of Learning or Cognitive
Disabilities</strong></h3>
<p>Learning and cognitive-related disabilities can be as varied as
mobility-related disabilities, perhaps more so. These disabilities can
range from a mild reading-related disability to very severe cognitive
impairments that may result in limited use of language and difficulty
processing complex information. For most of the disabilities in this
range, there are some common barriers and others that only affect those
with more severe cognitive disabilities.</p>
<p>Common barriers for this group include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of overly complex/advanced language</li>
<li>Inconsistent navigation</li>
<li>Overly complex or excessive amounts of content</li>
<li>Time limits (insufficient time to complete tasks)</li>
<li>Unstructured content (no visible headings, sections, topics,
etc.)</li>
<li>Unexpected actions (e.g., redirect when an element receives
focus)</li>
</ul>
<p>More specific disability-related issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading: Text justification (inconsistent spacing between
words)</li>
<li>Reading: Images of text (not readable with a text reader)</li>
<li>Visual: Visual content with no text description</li>
<li>Math: Images of math equations (not readable with a math
reader)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Everyone</strong></h3>
<p>While we generally think of barriers in terms of access for people
with disabilities, there are some barriers that impact all types of
users, though these are often thought of in terms of usability.
Usability and accessibility go hand-in-hand. Adding accessibility
features improves usability for others. Many people, including those who
do not consider themselves to have a specific disability (such as those
over the age of 50) may find themselves experiencing typical age-related
loss of sight, hearing, or cognitive ability. Those with varying levels
of colour blindness may also fall into this group.</p>
<p>Some of these usability issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link text that does not describe the destination or function of the
link</li>
<li>Overly complex content</li>
<li>Inconsistent navigation</li>
<li>Low contrast</li>
<li>Unstructured content<a
href="http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator"></a></li>

<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>When addressing accessibility, a main focus is to make web content
compatible with screen readers (often used by people who are blind to
access their computer, device, and the Web). That’s not to say that
people with other types of disabilities don’t encounter barriers, but
this group will certainly face the most barriers given the visual nature
of the Web. Often, addressing screen reader compatibility issues will
help resolve potential barriers for others as well.</p>
<p>Here we focus specifically on the ChromeVox screen reader add-on for
the Chrome web browser because of its simplicity, good support for
standards, and its availability across platforms as free, open-source
software. We will first introduce you to a number of other screen
readers before spending some time learning to use ChromeVox and to
experience barriers firsthand.</p>
<p>For new or inexperienced users, learning to operate a screen reader
can be difficult, particularly if you are not using one on a regular
basis. Memorizing the basic commands provided in the upcoming pages is
often enough for screen reader testing purposes, though there is much
more functionality in screen readers that is not discussed here. You are
encouraged to explore the full range of features that screen readers
have to offer as time allows.</p>
<p>ChromeVox is ideal for introducing screen readers, though it does
have its limitations, and people who are blind are more likely to use
one of the more broadly used screen readers like JAWS, Window Eyes (now
discontinued), NVDA, or VoiceOver. What may seem accessible with
ChromeVox may not be accessible when using other screen readers.</p>
<h2>Summary of Available Screen Readers</h2>
<p>There are a variety of screen readers available for different
operating systems, whether you are using Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, or
Android, and there are also a few web-based screen readers. The more
common screen readers are listed below for reference.</p>
<p>Screen readers should not be confused with text-to-speech (TTS)
applications. Though both read text content aloud, TTS only reads
content text, such as the text on this web page. Screen readers read
content text, but they also read aloud elements of the browser’s
interface and the operating system, as well as providing ways to
navigate the content, with features for listing headings, links, or
tables, for example. These features are not typically found in TTS
applications.</p>

<h2>Screen Reader Usage Trends</h2>
<p>It is not typically feasible to test with every screen reader
available, so it is a good idea to choose the screen readers you use
strategically. Understanding screen reader usage patterns can help you
decide which one(s) to test with.</p>
<p>The WebAIM Screen Reader User Survey, conducted every one to two
years since 2009, shows changing trends in screen reader usage. Up until
the 2019 survey, the JAWS screen reader was the most commonly used. With
built-in screen readers like VoiceOver on Mac and Narrator on Windows,
and free open source screen readers like NVDA — each much improved in
recent years — many users are opting for these less expensive options.
JAWS, though highly functional, is expensive software and can be out of
reach for some who need screen reader technology. In the 2019 survey
NVDA users (72.4%) surpassed JAWS users (61.7%) for the first time.
Mac’s VoiceOver users (47.1%) also increased since the 2017 survey
(39.6%), as did Narrator users (30.3%) compared with users reporting in
2017 (21.4%). See the latest <a
href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/#used">WebAIM
Screen Reader User Survey</a> for the latest statistics.</p>
<p>Mobile screen reader usage has increased exponentially over the last
few years, from just 12% in 2009 to 88% in 2017, increasing again in
2019 to 96.5% — keep this in mind when screen reader testing. Testing
with mobile screen readers should be considered.</p>
<p>The following table and graph from WebAIM shows usage statistics for
screen readers commonly used for desktop and laptop computers.</p>

<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>We are introducing you to the ChromeVox screen reader early in the
materials here so you have plenty of opportunity to practice using it.
It will be a useful tool for understanding what creates barriers in web
content, and it will be used throughout the units here to experience and
understand barriers firsthand.</p>
<p>For day-to-day screen reader testing, ChromeVox (particularly, the
ChromeVox plugin for the Chrome web browser) is our screen reader of
choice because of its simple installation and configuration, its ability
to work across computer platforms, and it is free and open source.</p>
<p>While a relatively small number of screen reader users currently use
ChromeVox, it is a highly effective tool for developers when testing web
content. Also, ChromeVox is tailored to work with elements of <a
href="https://www.google.com/drive">Google Drive</a>, so even for users
of other screen readers, ChromeVox may be preferable when working with
Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #3c3">
<p><strong>Toolkit:</strong> Visit the Chrome store while using the
Chrome web browser to install the <a
href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn">ChromeVox
screen reader</a>. It will be a key element of your Toolkit.</p>
</div>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Though we recommend using ChromeVox for
activities in the units that follow, if you already use another screen
reader regularly, you are free to use it if you prefer.</p>
</div>
<h2>ChromeVox Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open the Chrome web browser.</li>
<li>Type “ChromeVox” into the browser<span lang="it">’</span>s location
bar and press the Enter key.</li>
<li>In the search results that appear, ChromeVox should be the first.
Follow that link to the Chrome Web Store.</li>
<li>On the ChromeVox page in the store, click on the “Add to Chrome”
link to start the installation.</li>
<li>In the dialog that opens, click “Add to Chrome.”</li>
<li>When the installation is complete, ChromeVox will announce it is
ready, and a small dialog will open pointing out the ChromeVox icon
added to the Chrome toolbar. (You<span lang="it">’</span>ll need
speakers or headphones to hear ChromeVox.)</li>
<li>Click on the ChromeVox icon in the Chrome toolbar, then choose
Options.</li>
<li>On the Options screen, click in the Modifier Key field, and set the
key, typically by pressing the Alt key. In the key commands when you see
the “ChromeVox” or “Cvox” prefix before a specific key, this is
referring to the modifier key you set.</li>
<li>If Alt conflicts with other key commands on your system, try using
Ctrl, or Ctrl+Alt.</li>
<li>You may also want to adjust the voice used by ChromeVox, on the
Options page.</li>
<li>You may also want to set the reading speed, by pressing Cvox + [ to
speed up reading, and Cvox + ] to slow the rate.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Cvox key is held down while pressing other
keys. For example, to turn ChromeVox on or off, press the Cvox key
(e.g., Alt) and hold it, then quickly press the “A” key twice (i.e.,
Cvox + A + A).</p>
<p>The videos below show you how to install and begin using
ChromeVox.</p>

<p>Web content must be:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Perceivable</strong>: Users must be able to process web
content by seeing, hearing, or touching it (and someday maybe smelling
it). If one sense is missing, such as sight, information must be
perceivable through another sense, such as hearing.</li>
<li><strong>Operable</strong>: In general terms, web content must
operate with both a keyboard and a mouse but may also operate through
voice or other alternative input devices like switches and a

<li><strong>Understandable</strong>: Web content is presented in a
consistent, predictable, readable form that reduces the likelihood of
making errors and can be understood by a wide range of users.</li>

<h2 class="chapter-title">WCAG Accessibility Levels</h2>
</div>
<div class="ugc chapter-ugc">
<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>WCAG 2.1 groups guidelines by their level of importance and their
relative impact on accessibility. It is helpful to think of these levels
as things that must, should, and could be done to eliminate potential
barriers. The levels are Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA.<br />
</p>
<h2>Level A</h2>
<p>Level A guidelines address barriers that will prevent some groups
from accessing web content. They <strong>MUST</strong> be addressed or
the content will not be accessible to some people.</p>
<p>An example of a Level A barrier is an image that is not described in
text (<strong>Success Criteria 1.1.1</strong>). There is little a person
who is blind can do, without the help of another person, to determine
what is being presented in an image when it is not described.</p>
<h2>Level AA</h2>
<p>Level AA guidelines address barriers that may make it difficult to
access web content, but it may still be possible through workarounds or
added effort. They <strong>SHOULD</strong> be addressed, or the content
will be more effortful to access than it needs to be.</p>
<p>An example of a Level AA barrier is keyboard focus that is not
visible (<strong>Success Criteria 2.4.7</strong>). For someone with low
vision who navigates web content with a keyboard, the inability to see
when a link has focus, for instance, makes it difficult to know when to
press Enter to activate the link. They may still be able to find their
way to the link through trial and error, but a lot of unnecessary effort
would be needed.</p>
<h2>Level AAA</h2>
<p>Level AAA guidelines address usability, more so than barriers. These
items <strong>COULD</strong> be addressed to improve usability for
everyone.</p>
<p>An example of a Level AAA usability issue is the lower-level high
school reading–level requirement (<strong>Success Criteria
3.1.5</strong>). For instance, if someone reads in a second language,
the use of simpler language, whenever possible, makes reading easier.
The use of simpler language also improves accuracy when using automated
translation tools. Even for typical readers reading in their first
language, using simpler language is generally appreciated and easier to
comprehend. For someone with a cognitive disability, simpler language
will be easier to understand. In each case, however, the reading level
does not prevent a person from accessing the content, but that content
would be more <em>usable</em> if it were addressed.</p>
<h2>Which Level Should Be the Goal?</h2>
<p><strong>Level AA is the generally accepted level of accessibility
websites should aim to meet</strong>. If it is not possible to meet the
requirements at this level, then Level A should be a temporary goal,
while working toward Level AA over time. Very few websites will meet
Level AAA requirements, and, in some cases, it may be counterproductive
or undesirable to meet these guidelines. Take, for example, an online
medical sciences book. If the Level AAA reading level guideline were
followed, it would probably make the content unusable by the intended
audience (medical students), if jargon and technical language is
replaced with low level paraphrasing to meet this requirement. That
said, most public websites that cater to a general audience should
probably meet the lower-level high school reading–level requirement.</p>
<p>In addition to meeting Level AA requirements, websites can address
some of the Level AAA guidelines, but meeting Level AAA should generally
not be the goal.</p>

<p>There are 13 guidelines in WCAG 2.1 (e.g., <strong>Guideline
1.1</strong>), containing a total of 78 success criteria (e.g.,
<strong>Success Criterion 1.1.1</strong>), that represent basic goals
web authors and developers should aim for. Compared with WCAG 2.0, WCAG
2.1 adds one additional guideline (2.5) and 17 additional success
criteria. Guidelines provide a framework for organizing success
criteria.</p>
<p>Examining a guideline below from WCAG 2.1, you can see the principle
listed first (<strong>2. Operable</strong>), followed by a guideline
associated with that principle (<strong>Guideline 2.1</strong> Keyboard
Accessible), followed by a success criterion associated with the
guideline (<strong>Success Criterion 2.1.1</strong> Keyboard).</p>

class="alignnone size-large wp-image-55" width="1024" height="500"
alt="Format for presenting guidelines in WCAG, described above." /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The guidelines themselves are not meant to be
testable. Success criteria are testable. You may also notice that
success criteria are technology-neutral. That is, they are not specific
to HTML, JavaScript, Flash, or any other web technology. Instead, these
technology-specific references are found in the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/understanding-techniques.html">Sufficient
and Advisory Techniques</a>, described on the next page. These
techniques can be found by following the “How to Meet” link to the right
of each success criterion. Additional information about the guideline
can be found by following the “Understanding” link.</p>
<h3>Normative vs. Informative</h3>
<p>WCAG documents are classified as either “normative” or “informative.”
Guidelines and success criteria are normative. That is, they are
required for conformance. Elements of WCAG that are normative are also
stable and do not change until at least a new version of the guidelines
is released. For example, the guidelines and success criteria in WCAG
2.1 will not change until WCAG 3.0 (or whatever version number it is
assigned) is released.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Understanding and Techniques documents are
“informative” (also known as “non-normative”), which means they are not
required for conformance. These documents are evolving and change as new
information and new techniques become available in between releases of
stable, normative, specification documents.</p>

<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>For each success criteria in WCAG, there are supporting techniques
available that provide potential solutions or strategies that can be
used to ensure barriers are removed in web content. The techniques
documents continue to evolve over time (i.e., informative). New
techniques are added as technology and our understanding of barriers and
solutions improve. This is unlike the WCAG specification itself, which
stays stable (i.e., normative) until a new version of the specification
is created.</p>
<p>While techniques listed in the WCAG supporting documents are
recommended, strategies for eliminating barriers are not required per
se. There may be several techniques available to address a success
criteria, or there may be techniques available that are not listed in
the supporting documents. As such, techniques are not a requirement;
success criteria are. Any technique can be used that reliably removes
barriers associated with a particular success criterion.</p>
<p>There are two types of techniques that can be used to remove
barriers: sufficient techniques and advisory techniques.</p>
<h2>Sufficient Techniques</h2>
<p>Sufficient techniques are techniques known to reliably address
particular barriers. They are typically technology-specific, particular
techniques with a related prefix for resolving HTML accessibility (H),
scripting accessibility (SCR), Flash accessibility (FLASH), or one of
the other technologies outlined in the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li>General (G)</li>
<li>HTML (H)</li>
<li>CSS (C)</li>
<li>Client Side Scripting (SCR)</li>
<li>Server Side Scripting (SVR)</li>
<li>WAI-ARIA (ARIA)</li>
<li>Flash (FLASH)</li>
<li>Failures (F)</li>
<li>PDF documents (PDF)</li>
<li>Silverlight (SL)</li>
<li>SMIL (SM)</li>
<li>Plain-Text (T)</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of a sufficient technique for <strong>Guideline
1.1</strong>, <a
href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0&amp;showtechniques=131#non-text-content">Success
Criteria 1.1.1 Non-text Content</a>, is technique “<a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H37.html">H37 Using alt
attributes on img elements</a>.” Adding alt text to an image that
requires a short description is sufficient to make the meaningful
information in the image accessible. But also, “<a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA6.html">ARIA6: Using
aria-label to provide labels for objects</a>” is listed as a sufficient
technique for this success criterion. While the latter technique may be
sufficient for those using current technology, there is a possibility,
for those using an older browser or assistive technology (AT), that the
WAI-ARIA solution may not be supported by their AT. That is, despite
being a sufficient technique, it is still a good idea to include some
redundancy where newer solutions are being applied. An example of this
backwards compatibility is using both alt text and aria-label to provide
image descriptions. If aria-label fails, the alt text will be read in
its place. This is sometimes referred to as “graceful degradation.”</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Don’t be too concerned about understanding
WAI-ARIA techniques at this point. These are typically techniques web
developers would apply, or it may be applied behind the scenes by
authoring tools when creating web content. For example, consider the
task of adding alt text to an image you should understand (i.e., an
image that is not decorative). The alt text code will look like the
example below when presented in the HTML of a web page. It may be added
to images through a text, alt, or title field in the authoring tool used
to insert the image into a web page.</p>

techniques for Success Criteria 1.1.1</a> and examine the other
techniques associated with this success criteria in <strong>Guideline
1.1</strong>.</p>
</div>
<h2>Advisory Techniques</h2>
<p>Advisory techniques may not reliably address barriers as can
sufficient techniques, but they do address a particular barrier for
particular people.</p>
<p>An example of an advisory technique might be “<a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C22.html">C22: Using CSS to
control visual presentation of text</a>” for <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#content-structure-separation">Success
Criteria 1.3.1 Info and Relationships</a>. While this technique can be
used to style text with various sizes, fonts, or indentations to
represent document structure (the appearance of headings and
subheadings), the visual appearance of the content will not be
sufficient for those who cannot see the visual presentation. As a
result, this technique needs to be used in addition to a sufficient
technique that adds the structural semantics provided by the HTML
heading elements, H1 to H6 (<a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H42.html">H42: Using h1-h6 to
identify headings</a>).</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #0000ff">
<p><strong>Suggested Reading:</strong> See techniques for <a
href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0#info-and-relationships">1.3.1
Info and Relationships</a> for more about sufficient and advisory
techniques for this success criteria.</p>
</div>
<h2>A Third Category of Techniques</h2>
<p>There is a third category of techniques called
<strong>failures</strong>. These are not techniques that could be used
to resolve potential barriers. Rather, failures are techniques that,
when used, potentially introduce barriers. Techniques listed in this
category should be avoided.</p>
<p>An example of a failure is “<a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/F43.html">F43: Failure of
Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using structural markup in a way that
does not represent relationships in the content</a>.” In this case, a
web author or developer uses HTML heading markup to make text larger. As
a result, the large text becomes part of the document’s topic structure.
When read by assistive technologies, the text is announced as a heading,
which may result in confusion since a heading structure is presented
where none is expected. In a case like this, the C22 advisory technique
mentioned above should be used to size the fonts instead of using the
structural markup and larger text provided by HTML headings.</p>

<h2>Selecting a Level of Conformance</h2>
<p>Each <strong>level</strong> of accessibility can represent goals with
which organizations and websites should aim to conform. Depending on the
website — whether it’s a site being retrofitted to improve its state of
accessibility or if it’s a new website being developed — the conformance
goal may vary.</p>
<p>As you’ll recall, <strong>Level A</strong> allows most people to
access the content of a website. While Level A conformance is an
honourable accomplishment, it is generally considered “minimal
conformance.” If you are working with a limited budget (or no budget)
this may be an acceptable level of accessibility. However, as mentioned
earlier, it is generally accepted that <strong>most sites should strive
for Level AA</strong> and, perhaps, should conform with a few of the
Level AAA success criteria (defined below).</p>
<p>If you are working on a new website, Level AA should be the goal from
the start. Assuming the developers know what needs to be done, there is
very little extra effort required to jump from Level A to Level AA. If
you are working with an existing site that is receiving an accessibility
retrofit, then you may want to first aim for Level A, then with time
resolve all Level AA issues. Generally, it is less costly to build a
site to be accessible from the start than it is to build a site and
retrofit it later to conform.</p>
<p>Level AAA conformance is unattainable for many websites. While it is
possible to conform with some of the requirements at this level, they
can often be counterproductive or unnecessary. Take for instance the
reading level requirement (WCAG 2.0, <strong>SC 3.1.5</strong>). Public
organizations will want to meet this guideline, reducing the reading
level required to understand their website’s content and thereby
reaching the broadest audience possible. But for other sites that focus
on a particular or highly educated audience, it may be impossible or
even inadvisable to comply with this requirement. Imagine an advanced
book in biomechanics written at the lower secondary school reading level
required to satisfy this guideline. If it were possible, replacing the
advanced terminology and jargon with low-level paraphrasing would likely
make the content unusable by the intended audience.</p>
<h2>Other Conformance Considerations</h2>
<p>In addition to meeting all the Level A, AA, or AAA requirements,
there are other conformance requirements to consider before being able
to claim conformance at one of these levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full pages:</strong> Conformance applies to full web pages
only. It cannot apply to parts of pages.</li>
<li><strong>Complete processes:</strong> When a conformance claim is
being made on a collection of pages that make up a web application, for
instance, all pages in the collection must conform. If one were to claim
“the discussion forum conforms at Level AA,” then all aspects of the
forum must conform — logging in, reading posts, posting new messages,
and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility supported:</strong> Techniques to implement
accessibility requirements are done in a way that is supported by
assistive technologies. For example, there is a linked image, which when
clicked, opens a feature. The linked image does not have alt text to
describe the function of the image but does include text nearby that
says “click the button to open the feature.” This example would not be
accessibility supported. Even though the image has been described with
text, it has not been described in a way that assistive technologies can
make use of it. In this case, by adding alt text to the image, it would
be considered accessibility supported because assistive technologies can
read alt text. Accessibility support is a very complex issue with many
grey areas. Read through “<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-accessibility-support-head">Understanding
Accessibility Support</a>” for a discussion of other things to consider
when assessing accessibility support.</li>
<li><strong>Non-interference:</strong> When non-accessible technologies
are used and accessible alternatives are provided, the inaccessible
version must not interfere with access to the accessible version. For
instance, an embedded Flash object may have a link to an accessible HTML
version on the page following the object. If, while navigating through
the page by keyboard or using assistive technology, the cursor becomes
trapped in the Flash object, it is interfering with the accessible
version that follows. In this case, even though an accessible version is
provided, it cannot be accessed; thus, the page does not conform. If a
bypass link were provided to skip over the Flash object, and users were
able to back out of the object, the page would then conform. Ideally,
the Flash object should be created in a way that does not trap the
cursor.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Making Conformance Claims</h2>
<p>Once a website has addressed all the issues required for a certain
level of conformance, it may be desirable to “claim” conformance, though
there is no requirement that a claim be made in order to conform.</p>
<h3>Basic Conformance Claim</h3>
<p>A basic claim must include <strong>the date</strong> the site was
judged to be conformant. Since web content tends to change over time,
conformance can typically only be claimed for a specific date (with
exceptions such as numbered versions of web software). The basic claim
must also include <strong>the specification</strong> or standard the
site is claiming conformance with, and it must include <strong>the
level</strong> of conformance. A basic conformance claim may look like
the following:</p>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="example">
<p>On January 20, 2019, this site conformed with the Web Content
Accessibility Guideline 2.0 at Level AA.</p>
</div>
<p>A conformance claim can be more extensive than just a basic claim
like that described above. It can also provide documentation about the
accessibility features found on a website, so those accessing the site
with assistive technologies can read about these features rather than
having to discover them on their own. This documentation is often found
linked prominently in the navigation elements of a website, usually near
the start of a page so it is easily found by assistive technology users,
and it is often labelled “Accessibility” or “Accessibility
Statement.”</p>
<p>If the conformance claim does not apply to the whole site (e.g.,
there may be some older content that remains inaccessible), the scope of
the claim should also be specified. For instance, add to the basic claim
above, “…for any content added to the site after January 1, 2012.” The
claim can also list known issues if there are areas of the site that are
known to be inaccessible, perhaps because there isn’t a suitable
accessible alternative to a particular technology being used. For
example, “…the video conferencing area of the site remains
non-conformant due to the lack of an alternative accessible conferencing
system.”</p>

</div>
<div class="ugc chapter-ugc">
<div>
<!-- pb_fixme -->
<p>Currently, there are two versions of WCAG that are considered stable
specifications.</p>
<p>Initially released in 2008, <strong>WCAG 2.0</strong> is the basis
for many international accessibility rules and regulations, and it
remains a stable W3C Recommendation. However, since it was developed
when the first smartphones were only just emerging, there is little in
the specification to address accessibility through mobile devices. Also,
there was little in WCAG 2.0 to address accessibility for people with
cognitive disabilities.</p>
<p>On June 5, 2018, <strong>WCAG 2.1</strong> was released as a W3C
Recommendation. It is intended to extend WCAG 2.0, adding 17 new success
criteria and one additional guideline that addresses mobile
accessibility, as well as aspects of accessibility for people with
cognitive disabilities, among other additions.</p>
<p>A goal in creating WCAG 2.1 has been to ensure that sites that comply
with it also continue to comply with WCAG 2.0. This ensures that any
obligations to conform with WCAG 2.0 are compatible with WCAG 2.1
conformance, if it is used as the basis for creating accessible web
content. Organizations and websites should be aiming to conform with
WCAG 2.1 into the future but can continue to conform with WCAG 2.0.</p>
<p>We won’t go into the details and differences between WCAG 2.0 and
WCAG 2.1 here, but we will point out the new success criteria, and the
one guideline, when we get into the details in the units that follow
this one. Look for the following to denote success criteria that fall

is evolving under the code name “Silver,” which has the chemical symbol

<p>For those in Ontario who want to understand how WCAG 2.0 is related
to the <em>Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</em>
(AODA), this is a brief discussion of how it applies. The AODA
legislation outlines a gradual roll-out, initially adopting WCAG 2.0
Level A and working toward Level AA web content accessibility
requirements with the exception of two success criteria.</p>
<p>These two exceptions are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Success Criteria 1.2.4 Captions Live</strong> (Level
AA)</li>
<li><strong>Success Criteria 1.2.5 Audio Description
(Prerecorded)</strong> (Level AA)</li>
</ul>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #0000ff">
<p><strong>Suggested Reading:</strong> Review <a
href="https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/110191#BK14">Section 14(3)
of the Integrated Accessibility Standards of the AODA</a> for details on
the above exceptions.</p>
</div>
<p>Though the rest of WCAG 2.0 is adopted verbatim, obligated
organizations in the province (except the Ontario government that has
until January 1, 2020) are not required to provide captions for live
events or audio description for prerecorded video. Both of these are
Level AA success criteria in WCAG 2.0. Depending on where you are in the
world, other jurisdictions will often require these success criteria be
met.</p>
<p>There are no plans currently to adopt WCAG 2.1 as the basis for web

that you have been introduced to WCAG, this activity will give you an
opportunity to explore the specification and develop familiarity with
its parts.</p>
<p>To assist you, we have set up a scavenger hunt activity. Read the
requirements that follow for details.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Your mission in this scavenger hunt is to <strong>find</strong> <span
style="text-decoration: underline"><strong><em>one</em></strong></span><strong>sufficient
technique for each of the following barriers and record the technique ID
and its title/description.</strong> See the sample below for an example
of what’s expected for this exercise. If there are multiple techniques,
choose the one you think fits best, given the barrier described.</p>
<p><strong>Hint:</strong> You will likely start by looking at some key
words in the barrier description in order to locate the relevant
<strong>Guideline or Success Criterion in WCAG 2.0 or WCAG
2.1</strong><em>.</em> After that, look at <strong>How to Meet</strong>
that guideline in order to identify a <strong>Sufficient
Technique</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is your list of barriers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Image has no text alternative.</li>
<li>Video has no captions.</li>
<li>Colour is used on its own to represent meaning.</li>
<li>Contrast between text and background colours is insufficient (&lt;
4.5:1).</li>
<li>Form button is not keyboard operable.</li>
<li>Page redirects to another before contents can be read.</li>
<li>Web page does not have a descriptive title.</li>
<li>No means is provided to skip past a large main menu on a web
page.</li>
<li>The language of a page is not defined.</li>
<li>Page redirects when a form radio button receives focus.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sample</h3>
<p>Here is a sample:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p><strong>Barrier:</strong> Pre-recorded video does not audibly
describe meaningful visual activity.</p>
<p><strong>Technique ID:</strong> G78: Providing a second,
user-selectable audio track that includes audio descriptions.</p>

<h2>Principle 1: Perceivable</h2>
<p>Information and user interface components must be presentable to
users in ways they can perceive.</p>
</section>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="definition">
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Perceive</strong>: 1. To become aware of (something) through
the <strong>senses</strong>, especially the sight; recognize or observe.
2. To come to <strong>comprehend</strong>; grasp (dictionary.com)</p>
</div>
<h3>The Principle Explained</h3>
<h4>Sensing</h4>
<p>As suggested in the first definition above, people must be able to
perceive web content through one or more of their senses. When a person
cannot see or hear, for instance, and an alternate means of perceiving
is not available, then that content becomes inaccessible to them.</p>
<p>Content may not be perceivable if web authors:</p>
<ul>
<li>choose small or hard-to-read fonts;</li>
<li>specify colours for fonts that do not provide sufficient contrast
with the background;</li>
<li>leave out a text description of a photograph;</li>
<li>do not provide captions or a transcription for multimedia and audio
content; or</li>
<li>require timed responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perceptual barriers occur when information is communicated entirely
through one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sight</li>
<li>Sound</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people perceive web content through sight and sound. When
content is communicated exclusively through one sense, such as sight,
some people will not be able to perceive it.</p>
<p>These types of perceptual barriers are addressed through
<strong>Guidelines1.1</strong>, <strong>1.2</strong>, and
<strong>1.4</strong>.</p>
<h4>Comprehending</h4>
<p>The second definition suggests people must be able to comprehend or
grasp web content. The ability to comprehend web content can be affected
by the structure, the relationships between elements, its complexity, or
consistency in the presentation.</p>
<p>Perceptual barriers of this nature occur when:</p>
<ul>
<li>information is poorly structured;</li>
<li>navigation or presentation is inconsistent;</li>
<li>the focus ordering of content is illogical;</li>
<li>functional elements are not effectively described or labelled;</li>
<li>content operates only in a single display orientation; or</li>
<li>instructions reference content solely through shape, colour, size,
or visual location.</li>
</ul>
<p>These types of perceptual barriers are addressed by <strong>Success
Criterion 1.3.3</strong> (sensory characteristics), described later in
this unit.</p>

<h4>Non-Text Content Explained</h4>
<p>There is good reason why this guideline is the first. While barriers
can affect a wide range of people, those who tend to face the most
barriers are people whose visual senses are limited or absent. Given the
visual nature of the Web, potential barriers are many. Anything visual
that is not described in text is a potential barrier.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I always need alternatives to images in my
website?</strong></p>
<p>If a website has photographs, artwork, drawings, or other graphic
elements, adding text alternatives is an easy way to make the site
accessible to people with certain disabilities. In addition, text
alternatives benefit people who use text-based browsers, have slow
Internet connections, or have limited data plans. Text alternatives also
make it possible to search the Web for images.</p>
<ol>
<li>Many people who are blind use a screen reader to access computers.
But screen reading programs only understand text; they cannot interpret
the content of images. By writing a description for each image on a web
page, screen reader users gain access to the images. In most cases, the
description need not be elaborate. The text alternative for a photograph
of a sunset can be as simple as “sunset on Georgian Bay.” The text
alternative for a reproduction of a Picasso painting might be: “painting
of an old man with a guitar by Pablo Picasso.”</li>
<li>Text-based browsers do not display images. By providing text
alternatives, people who use text-based browsers will see the
descriptions displayed in place of the images.</li>
<li>Similarly, people with slow Internet connections or limited data
plans sometimes set their browser to not display images (web pages load
faster when images are not displayed, using up much less bandwidth). By
providing text alternatives, users will see the descriptions displayed
in place of the images, as opposed to seeing blank spaces where images
would have appeared.</li>
<li>When search engines “crawl” websites to catalogue their content,
they cannot determine what is contained in images (image content
detection is in its early stages of development). Search engines only
“understand” text. By including text alternatives, search engines are
able to catalogue images, making them searchable.</li>
</ol>
<h4>The Art of Alt Text</h4>
<p>One of the most common ways to remove barriers associated with visual
content is to use the HTML alt attribute with images in web content.
When people learn about web accessibility, “alt text” is often
introduced first. Alt text for images is, in most cases, an easy
accommodation. There is, however, an art to creating effective alt
text.</p>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="definition">
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elements:</strong> Often referred to as HTML tags, these are
the main features of HTML syntax. Examples include
 <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;</code>, or
<code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>, among many others.</p>
<figure id="attachment_53" class="wp-caption alignnone"
aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53" style="width: 499px">

Wikipedia</a></figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="definition">
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Attributes:</strong> These are the properties associated with
an HTML element. In the image above, <code>class</code> is an example of
an attribute. Attributes have values that define characteristics of an
element. Other examples of attributes include <code>style=""</code>,
<code>href=""</code>, <code>src=""</code>, and <code>title=""</code>,
among many others.</p>
</div>
<p>What needs to be described in alt text must be done in <strong>125
characters</strong> or less. Some screen readers will stop reading at
this character length. There is often much more in an image (i.e., a
picture is worth a thousand words) than can be described in alt text.
Depending on the context, the same image may have different
descriptions. Consider the following image in the two contexts
described:</p>
<figure id="attachment_61" class="wp-caption alignnone"
aria-describedby="caption-attachment-61" style="width: 974px">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/population_growth.png"
class="wp-image-61 size-full" width="974" height="593"
alt="When graphing population growth, population is presented on the y-axis, and years are presented on the x-axis." />
<figcaption>Example of a chart. Source: United Nations, World Population
Prospects.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4>Context 1: In a statistics book</h4>
<p>In a statistics book the actual data values in the graph may not be
important. What may be important is the way that data is presented. Alt
text in this case might read:</p>
<p><em>“When graphing population growth, population is presented on the
y-axis, and years are presented on the x-axis.”</em></p>
<h4>Context 2: In an article on global birth rates</h4>
<p>In an article that talks about birth rates around the world, the data
values will be more important, and the way the data is presented less
so. Alt text in this case might read:</p>
<p><em>“Since 1950, population growth for less-developed countries has
increased at 5 times the rate of developed countries. See
below.”</em></p>
<p>Note the reference to additional description with “See below.” With
the limitation on the length of alt text, it is commonly necessary to
provide additional details about an image in a long description. This
can often be accomplished by providing an extended description in the
text surrounding the image and in the alt text referring to that
description. This extended description can be placed before or after the
image or perhaps in a caption for the image. These long descriptions can
be beneficial for many people, including those that do not have a
disability but perhaps are not sure how to interpret the graph.</p>
<p>A long description for context 2, might then read:</p>
<p><em>“In 1950, the ratio of population growth between less- and
more-developed countries was approximately 2.5:1. Since then, the ratio
has increased steadily. Today, that ratio is approximately 6:1. By 2050,
that ratio is expected to increase to 9:1, with developed countries
maintaining a close-to-zero population growth, compared to a nearly 600%
increase in less-developed countries.”</em></p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Alt text should be no longer than 125
characters. Some screen readers will stop reading at this character
length.</p>
</div>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> The HTML image element (i.e.,
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) also has a <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_longdesc.asp">longdesc</a>
attribute that can be added to it, in addition to alt text, that
references a URL to a location where a more detailed description is
provided, perhaps on another web page or perhaps farther down the page,
accessed using an HTML anchor. Unfortunately, <a
href="https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/longdesctestcases.htm"
title="Longdesc Test Cases"><code>longdesc</code> is not
well-supported</a> in any of the common browsers, so at this point using
an alternative to <code>longdesc</code>, like describing in the
surrounding text, is recommended.</p>
</div>
<h4>Text Is Special</h4>
<p>One important characteristic of text is its <em>adaptability</em>. As
mentioned, text makes images searchable and enables search engines to
index the alt text of images. Some of the many ways text can be adapted,
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen readers can convert it to audio</li>
<li>Screen readers can convert it to Braille</li>
<li>Text-to-speech software can convert it to audio</li>
<li>Text can be spoken and accessed with speech recognition
software</li>
<li>It can be translated using translation software</li>
<li>Tools can simplify text to make it more readable</li>
<li>Text can be magnified without losing its crisp appearance, unlike
images of text</li>
<li>Text colour can be changed to make it more readable</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, remember, providing text alternatives is usually a good way
to make web content more accessible.</p>

<h4><strong><span
id="chapter-019-slug-1-1-text-alternatives-level-a.xhtml_TT1.1.1"></span>Try
This: CAPTCHA and Spambots</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Are You Human? Hiding from Spammers</strong></p>
<p>Spam robots are constantly roaming through sites to find ways of
accessing unprotected mail systems so they can be used to send
unsolicited mail or to hide the origins of spam emails.</p>
<ol>
<li>To prevent “spambots” from finding their way into websites, a common
strategy is to use a CAPTCHA task. This strategy requires a task be
completed that can only be accomplished by a human being. The screenshot
below shows a typical CAPTCHA task, in which a user identifies randomly
generated letters in an image and enters those letters into a form
field, typically done while registering on a system or using a web form
that sends email.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/captcha.jpg"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-50" width="579" height="231"
alt="CAPTCHA task with phonetic spelling as an accessible alternative" /></li>
</ol>
<p>CAPTCHAs can be effective for warding off spambots, but they pose
access barriers for some users. A person who is blind would not be able
to see the characters in the CAPTCHA image and, thus, would be prevented
from registering on the system without the help of a sighted person.
It’s not possible to include a text alternative of the characters in the
CAPTCHA image because spambots can easily be programmed to find them.
CAPTCHAs are available with audio output to get around this problem, so
the blind person can hear the characters in a CAPTCHA image. But this
still leaves out deaf blind users, who cannot see or hear the CAPTCHA
characters. For such cases the site maintainer should provide a means
for registrants to contact the site administrator, who can register the
person manually. A variety of CAPTCHA utilities are available on the
Web, which can be copied into a site’s forms, and free services are
available to generate audio CAPTCHAs:</p>
<ol>
<li><ul>
<li><a href="http://www.captchas.net">Free CAPTCHA Service</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Another method of confirming that a human and not a spambot is
registering on a website is to have registrants confirm their
registration by replying to a message sent to their email address. This
method avoids accessibility issues associated with CAPTCHA and can be
accessible to deaf blind users. Many web applications today have email
confirmation utilities built into them.</li>

<h2><strong>Guideline 1.2</strong> Time-Based Media</h2>
<p>Provide alternatives for time-based media.</p>
</section>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="definition">
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Time-Based Media</strong>: Time-based media includes various
forms of media like video, audio, slides, computer simulations, or any
other media that has duration as a property and is presented over
time.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Why do I need to include alternatives for “time-based media”
(multimedia)?</strong></p>
<p>If a website includes a multimedia presentation like a movie or
video, some people will be unable to perceive (or will have difficulty
perceiving) the visuals and/or the audio. By providing alternatives, web
content authors improve accessibility for a wide range of individuals
with and without disabilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individuals who have trouble understanding the visual track include
people with visual impairments, certain cognitive disabilities, language
disabilities, and learning disabilities. Text alternatives make the
multimedia presentation accessible to these people.</li>
<li>Individuals who have trouble understanding the audio track include
people who are hard of hearing or deaf or who have certain cognitive,
language, or learning disabilities. Text alternatives and captioning are
the two most common ways to enhance accessibility for people who have
trouble processing the audio portion of a multimedia presentation.</li>
<li>People who are deaf and blind may have trouble (or be unable to)
understand the visual track, the audio track, or both. A special type of
text alternative, the alternative for time-based media, can make
multimedia accessible to people who are deaf and blind.</li>
<li>Second-language learners benefit from text alternatives, especially
those who understand a second language better when they read it rather
than listen to it.</li>
<li>Some people are <em>visual learners</em> — they are “wired” to
understand best by looking rather than by hearing or doing. Others are
<em>auditory learners</em> — they learn best by listening rather than
seeing or doing. Text alternatives help them all get the most from a
multimedia presentation.</li>
<li>Text alternatives and captions are convenient. For example, a
captioned video can be understood in a noisy environment (like a bar) or
in a quiet environment (like a bedroom where one person is sleeping
while the other is watching a movie).</li>
<li>Text alternatives make multimedia searchable. When search engines
“crawl” websites to index their content, they cannot “read” movies and
videos. Search engines only understand text (though image recognition
technology is currently emerging).</li>
</ol>

<h4>1.2.1 Audio-Only and Video-Only (Prerecorded) Explained</h4>
<p>When audio content is presented, people who are deaf or hard of
hearing may not be able to access it. When video content is presented
(without audio), people who are blind may not be able to access it. In
both cases, equivalent alternatives are required. In both cases, text
equivalents can serve this purpose by reproducing the content of an
audio track as text or describing what is going on in the video in
text.</p>

</section>
<h4>1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded) Explained</h4>
<p>Any video that contains meaningful spoken dialogue requires closed
captions in order to make the audio portion of the video accessible to
people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Captions should identify who is
speaking and describe other meaningful audio elements that are relevant
to comprehending the video.</p>
<h4>Closed vs. Open Captions</h4>
<p>Closed captions should be used instead of open captions. The latter
type of captions are burned right into the video, cannot be hidden, and
are not typically editable. In contrast, closed captions are contained
in a text file and are presented over a video. Closed captions can be
hidden away if they are not needed, and they are easily edited in a
simple text editor.</p>
<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<p>Though captions are a Level A requirement in WCAG, they are not
required when multimedia is being used as an alternative for text and is
clearly identified as such. For example,  in the previous unit you saw
an ordered list used to describe the steps required to install
ChromeVox. For some people, they may prefer to see it done rather than
reading instructions. The video that was included with the instructions
is an example of a <strong>media alternative for text</strong>. That
video was captioned, but it did not need to be.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Video producers should not rely on
automatically generated captions through services like YouTube.</p>
</div>
<p>Depending on the quality of the dialogue in a video, errors are
likely to occur when captions are automatically generated. However,
auto-generated captions can be used as an initial set of captions, which
a human being can edit to improve accuracy, provided the error rate is
less than about 25%. With error rates higher than that, one would be
better off captioning manually from scratch.</p>
<p>Automatically generated captions can be used as a temporary measure,
if, for example, a video release is time sensitive, and captions cannot
be created in time for that release. Video producers should still
caption those videos using human captioners, as soon as it is
feasible.</p>

<h4>1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)
Explained</h4>
<p>There are two approaches to this success criteria. Both describe
elements of a video, such as actions, characters, scene changes, or
on-screen text, among other important information that is not spoken in
the dialogue.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Audio Description:</strong> A secondary audio track is added
to a video. During breaks in dialogue of the video, this second audio
track describes visual information not referred to in the dialogue.</li>
<li><strong>Media Alternative:</strong> Important visual information not
spoken in the dialogue of the video is integrated into the captions,
typically enclosed in square brackets and inserted during breaks in
dialogue.</li>
</ol>

Criteria 1.2.6</strong> Sign Language (Prerecorded)</h3>
<p>Level AAA</p>
<p>Sign-language interpretation is provided for all prerecorded audio
content in synchronized media.</p>
</section>
<h4>Sign Language (Prerecorded) Explained</h4>
<p>American Sign Language (ASL) and other forms of sign language are
languages in their own right. For one, they are not based on English.
Much like French can be translated to English, ASL can also be
translated to English. Some people who are Deaf (with a capital D
representing a member of the Deaf community) may rely on ASL to
communicate and may understand very little English. Hence, typical
English captions may not always be understood effectively by a person
who is Deaf.</p>
<p>Some people who are deaf grow up in hearing families and will often
learn signed English, learn to read lips, and learn to write in English.
As a result, they will understand English captions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign language allows people who are deaf or hard of hearing to
understand the audio track of a synchronized media presentation.</li>
<li>Sign languages are very rich and convey shades of meanings that are
not captured in captions. For this reason, sign language interpretation
of synchronized media is considered more equivalent than access via
captions.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> A university makes a video of a visiting
professor talking to students and faculty and decides to post it online.
There is no sign-language interpreter during the original lecture.
Afterwards, the university produces a second video of a sign-language
interpreter interpreting the professor’s talk. The university “splices”
the second video into the corner of the original video.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some people who are deaf or hard of hearing are not as fluent in
written language as they are in sign language. Conversely, not everybody
who is deaf or hard of hearing understands sign language. For this
reason, access to synchronized media content is improved by providing
sign language as well as captions.</li>

Criteria 1.2.7</strong> Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded)</h3>
<p>Level AAA</p>
<p>Where pauses in foreground audio are insufficient to allow audio
descriptions to convey the sense of the video, extended audio
description is provided for all prerecorded video content in
synchronized media.</p>
</section>
<h4>Extended Audio Description (Prerecorded) Explained</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is similar to <strong>SC 1.2.5</strong>, which states that
authors include audio descriptions in synchronized media presentations.
Sometimes there are no (or insufficient) pauses to allow audio
descriptions. In these cases, provide extended audio descriptions to
convey the sense of the video.</li>
<li>Extended audio descriptions are done by freezing the presentation at
key moments and playing additional audio material. The synchronized
media presentation is then resumed.</li>
<li>Because extended audio descriptions may disrupt viewing for those
who do not need them, make it possible to turn the feature on and off.
Alternatively, two versions of a presentation, one with extended
descriptions and the other without, can be provided.
<ul>
<li><strong>Example:</strong> An art school owns a film of an
influential artist describing her approach, and she digitizes the film
for posting online. She speaks rapidly, with few pauses. As she talks,
she rapidly draws shapes on a flip chart. After completing each sketch,
she flips the flip chart and starts a new drawing, talking all the
while.</li>
<li>To make extended audio descriptions, the video is paused after she
completes each drawing, and a narrator describes it and her gestures.
The video then resumes.</li>

<h4>Media Alternative (Prerecorded) Explained</h4>
<ul>
<li>An “alternative for time-based media” is a method for making
audio-visual materials accessible to people who do not see well enough
to read captions and who do not hear well enough to listen to dialogue
and audio descriptions.</li>
<li>To create an alternative for time-based media, describe (in writing)
all information in the synchronized media (both visual and auditory).
This text is the alternative for time-based media. It reads like a book
narrative — a running description of everything that happens.</li>
<li>The alternative for time-based media contains a transcript of all
dialogue; descriptions of all visual information (e.g., scene changes,
actions, and facial expressions); and descriptions of all non-speech
sounds (e.g., laughter, off-screen voices, and background music).</li>
<li>If the presentation requires user interaction (e.g., buttons
labelled “Go to next lesson” at the end of every section), include
hypertext links to provide the same functionality.</li>
<li>These techniques make it possible for people who are deaf-blind to
access time-based media using a <a

Braille display</a>.</li>

<p>An alternative for time-based media that presents equivalent

</section>
<h4>Audio-Only (Live) Explained</h4>
<ul>
<li>To make live events (such as video conferencing, speeches, and radio
webcasts) accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, use text
alternatives.</li>
<li>The best text alternative is live text captioning. A trained human
operator listens to what is being said and types a verbatim transcript
in real time. The operator also adds non-spoken details, such as
laughter and applause, that are essential to understanding what is
happening.</li>
<li>If an event follows a script, a transcript prepared in advance is a
possibility. However, live captioning is preferred because the
operator’s transcript plays out in real time, and the operator can adapt
when deviations from the script occur.</li>

</div>
<h3>Guideline 1.3 Adaptable Explained</h3>
<p><strong>Why should I make it possible to present content in different
ways?</strong></p>
<p>People need choices in how they use computers. One of the advantages
of electronic documents over paper is flexibility. It is — or should be
— easy to substitute one font for another or change colours, line
spacing, margins, and dozens of other formatting characteristics. By
following a handful of guidelines, web content authors make it easy for
users to adjust the appearance and organization of web pages to suit
users’ individual needs. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>An individual with low vision can read many web pages when the font
is yellow, zoomed at 400% larger than normal, and displayed on a black
background. If web content authors follow guidelines, users can
substitute a custom style sheet to display pages in their desired
format.</li>
<li>A screen reader user accesses an online article about Canadian
weather. The content includes a data table that shows the number of
hours of sunshine per year for every provincial capital. The user can
navigate from cell to cell in the table, certain about which cells
contain header information and which cells contain data. A user using a
screen reader should be able to determine, for example, that Winnipeg
receives an average of 2,372 hours of sunshine per year.</li>
<li>A lawyer accesses the Internet from a web-enabled cell phone.
Despite the small screen, she can easily read the content on a law
library site that conforms to WCAG 2.1 guidelines.</li>

</div>
<h4>Info and Relationships Explained</h4>
<p>If you look “under the hood” of a web page, you will find a document
that consists of all the words that appear on the page (the “content”)
thickly interspersed with words, non-words, numbers, and symbols (the
“code”). The code describes how the content should be formatted and what
purpose it serves. For example, you might find something like this on a
recipe website:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;h1&gt;Recipes for Whole Wheat Bread&lt;/h1&gt;

  </code></pre>
<p>The pair of <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code> tags
that surround “Recipes for Whole Wheat Bread” means that the phrase
appears larger and bolder than the text that surrounds it, and the
phrase is the most important heading on the page.</p>
<p>Within that page of recipes there may be several types of whole wheat
bread. Each of those would be presented with an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>
to indicate their relationship as subtopics to the main topic of the
page presented in an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>. Likewise, within each
recipe, there may be an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> used to present
ingredients, another to present preparation instructions, and yet
another for serving suggestions. Each of those <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>
headings has a relationship to the parent <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> but
not to the other <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> headings that represent other
types of whole wheat bread. The following shows a semantic structure
(i.e., the relationships of topics and subtopics) associated with the
bread recipes.<br />
</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #0be">
<p><strong>Technical:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;Recipes for Whole Wheat Bread&lt;/h1&gt; //main topic
   &lt;h2&gt;Whole Grain Bread&lt;/h2&gt; //type of bread
       &lt;h3&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt; //recipe elements
       …
       &lt;h3&gt;Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;
       …
       &lt;h3&gt;Serving&lt;/h3&gt;
       …
   &lt;h2&gt;Multigrain Bread&lt;/h2&gt; //type of bread
      &lt;h3&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt; //recipe elements
      …
      &lt;h3&gt;Preparation&lt;/h3&gt;
      …
      &lt;h3&gt;Serving&lt;/h3&gt;
      …
   &lt;h2&gt;Sourdough Bread&lt;/h2&gt; //type of bread
      &lt;h3&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h3&gt; //recipe elements

      …
      &lt;h3&gt;Serving&lt;/h3&gt;
      …</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The above semantic structure uses headings that represent topics, and
subtopics could also be represented as a nested list. The following list
maintains the same relationships defined by the headings above. In this
case, there is a main list with one item, the main topic; three sublists
with each type of bread; and one sublist under each of those
representing the elements of a given recipe.</p>

<p><strong>SC 1.3.1</strong> requires web content authors to use the
right code to generate relationships and associate related information.
When they do, browsers and assistive technologies automatically
“understand” how content relates to other content on the page. (This is
what is meant by “programmatically determined.”) For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>On a form with two fields, “Name” and “Email address,” using the
correct code, in this case an associated <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>
element, ensures that browsers and assistive technologies know that the
first field contains the name and the second field contains the email
address. In the example markup below, note that the <code>for</code>
attribute with each label creates an association with the
<code>id</code> attribute of the related input field. When an input
field receives focus, the content of the associated label is read
out.</li>
</ul>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #0be">

<ul>
<li>In a table that displays the population of Canadian provinces, using

that says “11.4 million” with the header cell (i.e.,
<code>&lt;th&gt;</code>) “Ontario” and the data cell that says “3.3

Criterion 1.3.2</strong> Meaningful Sequence</h3>
<p>Level A</p>
<p>When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning,
a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.</p>
</section>
<h4>Meaningful Sequence Explained</h4>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="definition">
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Meaningful sequence</strong>: A sequence is
<em>meaningful</em> if the order of content in the sequence cannot be
changed without affecting its meaning.</p>
</div>
<p>There are a range of scenarios where web content must be arranged in
a particular order to be effectively understood. For example, when
looking up the address for a company, we would expect to find
information in this order:</p>
<p><strong>ABC Company</strong><br />
<strong>123 Main Street</strong><br />
<strong>Suite 456</strong><br />
<strong>Toronto</strong><br />
<strong>Ontario</strong><br />
<strong>M7N 8X9</strong></p>
<p>We might become confused if the information appeared in this
order:</p>
<p><strong>ABC Company<br />
</strong> <strong>Toronto<br />
</strong> <strong>123 Main Street<br />
</strong> <strong>Ontario<br />
</strong> <strong>Suite 456<br />
</strong> <strong>M7N 8X9</strong></p>
<p>The latter sequence is the presentation order to a screen reader user
if the web content author were to use the following layout table to
format the address in two columns. By default, screen readers read left
to right and top to bottom, thus reading the left then right cells in
the first row, left then right cells in the second row, and so on.</p>
<table class="addborder">
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>ABC Company</strong></td>
<td style="border-left: 1px solid black"><strong>Toronto</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>123 Main Street</strong></td>
<td style="border-left: 1px solid black"><strong>Ontario</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Suite 456</strong></td>
<td style="border-left: 1px solid black"><strong>M7N 8X9</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Sometimes content can be presented in any order without compromising
comprehensibility. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If an online magazine article contains a sidebar, it usually does
not matter whether a person reads the article first or the sidebar
first.</li>
<li>If CSS is used to position a main navigation bar, the content, and a
secondary navigation bar, understanding the page does not depend on the
order of the sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another common sequencing error occurs with modal dialogs, like the
one described below. For a modal dialog to comply with this success
criteria, when a user clicks an element (in this case, the button
labeled “Add Delivery Address”) to open the dialog, focus must be sent
to a focusable element in the dialog. The cursor must then remain
trapped in the dialog until the user explicitly dismisses it, either by
pressing the escape key or clicking one of the buttons.</p>
<p>Modal dialog sequencing failures occur when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cursor is not sent to the dialog when it opens, and keyboard
navigation continues through the content in behind the dialog.</li>
<li>While navigating through the dialog, the cursor does not loop back
to the start of the dialog after reaching its last element. Navigation
moves from the dialog back to the content in behind before the user has
acknowledged or dismissed the dialog.</li>
<li>When the dialog is acknowledged or dismissed, and the cursor’s focus
returns to the start of the browser window rather than returning to the
location the dialog was opened from.</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="definition">
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Modal Dialog</strong>: A dialog window that typically opens
on top of existing web content and forces the user to interact with the
dialog before access to the existing content can be re-established. The
modal dialog takes focus, and, typically, the content in behind the
dialog is greyed to reduce its visibility while the dialog is open.</p>

Criterion 1.3.3</strong> Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>Level A</p>
<p>Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not
rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape,
size, visual location, orientation, or sound.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #3c3">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For sensory characteristics related to colour,
refer to <strong>Guideline 1.4</strong>.</p>
</div>
</section>
<h4>Sensory Characteristics Explained</h4>
<p>Some users with disabilities cannot perceive shape, position, colour,
or location due to the nature of their disability and/or the assistive
technologies they use.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: There are three buttons at the bottom of a survey
form. The instructions read: “Click the brown button to exit the survey
without saving. Click the square button to save in-progress survey
results. Click the large button to submit your results.” A screen reader
user cannot determine which button is brown, square, or large.</p>
<p>The form buttons in the example above can be made accessible by
labelling the brown button “Exit without saving;” the square button
“Save partial results;” and the large button “Submit your results.”</p>
<p>In addition to the button examples above, phrases like “make a choice
from the menu on the left” will be more accessible as “immediately
following the main menu near the top of the page, make a choice from the
content menu on the left.” In the latter case, the user can find the
main menu, assuming it is labelled as such, and, when it is announced,
understand what follows will be the content menu.</p>
<p>When including instructions that describe how to interact with the
content of a web page, do not state the instructions exclusively in
terms of a single sensory characteristic. Instead, provide additional or
alternate descriptions.</p>

<h4>Orientation Explained</h4>
<p>When WCAG 2.0 was introduced in 2008, the first iPhone had only just
been released. At that time there was no real consideration regarding
device orientation because, typically, there was no need. Today,
however, mobile devices have become as prevalent as computer screens,
and orientation is a key characteristic of such devices. Even computer
monitors these days typically have an orientation setting that allow a
monitor to be turned to a vertical orientation.</p>
<p>It is common for people to mount a mobile device on their wheelchair
arm, for instance. Depending on preference, the device may be positioned
in either a portrait or landscape orientation. If web content is limited
to a particular orientation, it can make content difficult to access
effectively in cases like this.</p>
<p>There are occasions where orientation has to be limited to landscape
or to portrait, but in general, such a limitation should be avoided.</p>
<p>Some examples where orientation may be restricted could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A piano app, which would need to be in a landscape orientation in
order for the piano keys to be wide enough to touch individually with a
finger</li>
<li>A cheque deposit function in a banking app, where landscape
orientation would be required</li>
</ul>

<li>the content is implemented using technologies with support for

</ul>
</section>
<h4>Identify Input Purpose Explained</h4>
<p>For people with cognitive disabilities, low vision, or some types of
learning disabilities, it can be difficult to determine the purpose of a
form field or the correct format for the data being entered. This
success criteria indicates that browsers and assistive technologies must
be able to determine the expected input.</p>
<p>While browsers have been able to do this for some time, it’s only
recently that browsers have used their own strategies to automatically
fill (autofill) forms with predefined data using technology-specific
algorithms. For instance, Firefox will remember values entered into a
field named “name” or “telephone.” So, the next time a field with the
same name is encountered, it will offer up the values that were
previously entered into a field with the same name. While this does
provide some indication of the expected input, they are general and not
exact. That is, “name” could refer to first or last name; “telephone”
could include a country code, area code, and extension, and so on.</p>
<p>In HTML 5.2, the “autocomplete” attribute was added to help
developers meet this requirement in WCAG 2.1. It can be used to provide
specific descriptions about the purpose for form fields. For the name
example, one could add <code>autocomplete="given-name"</code> and
<code>autocomplete="family-name"</code> to make it clearer what name is
expected for respective form fields. If these values have been
previously saved, they would be offered to the user to choose from, so
they are not required to type their name.</p>
<p>There is fairly good support for the autocomplete attribute across
current browsers. Form developers are encouraged to use it to make it
easier for people with disabilities to fill out forms. Consequently, it
makes filling out forms more efficient for everyone, including frequent
online shoppers, for example. For more about “autocomplete” see the
suggested readings below.</p>

<h4>Identify Purpose Explained</h4>
<p>In addition to roles associated with various user interface elements
that identify what an element is (e.g., <code>role="link"</code> for a
link), this success criteria adds a purpose to that role (e.g., a link
to the site’s home page).</p>
<p>These “purposes” are defined by the W3C’s Cognitive and Learning
Disabilities Accessibility Task Force (COGA). It will likely be
introduced with the next version of WAI-ARIA, which will provide
standard ways to define purpose that will help make content on the Web
easier to understand, particularly for those with cognitive
disabilities.</p>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="definition">
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>WAI-ARIA:</strong> The two parts of the acronym represent
“Web Accessibility Initiative,” the group at the World Wide Web
Consortium (i.e., W3C) that works on accessibility specifications, and
“Accessible Rich Internet Applications,” the specification introduced
around the same time as HTML5. WAI-ARIA is used to add semantics for
custom web elements (like a slider or popup menu) and web interactivity
(like a control bar for a video player) to make them understandable by
assistive technologies such as screen readers.</p>
</div>
<p>For example, icons may be used to provide a visual representation of
an element. The home link, for instance, might include a house icon,
along with the word “home” to represent the link. Those who are then
unable to read the word can make use of the visual representation. Being
defined in a standard way (e.g.,
<code>aria-function="home-link"</code>), technology will be able to read
(i.e., programmatically determine) these “purpose” attributes, making it
possible for users to replace the icons with their own, perhaps using an
arrow icon to represent home, for instance, which may be more meaningful
to a particular person than a house icon.</p>
<p>Though standardizing how purpose will be identified is still a work
in progress, there are already WAI-ARIA landmark roles that function to
define the purpose of regions on a web page (e.g., banner, navigation,
main, or complementary). This then makes it possible for technology to
identify those regions. A user can potentially hide away everything
except the main region on the page, which contains the primary content,
so, for example, a person with an attention-related disability is not
distracted by other elements on the page.</p>
<p>Personalization of this nature is an evolving area of research at W3C
and elsewhere, which promises to optimize using the Web for each
individual user in the not-too-distant future.</p>

</section>
<h4>Use of Colour Explained</h4>
<p>Most estimates suggest that about 8% of males and 0.5% of females
have some form of colour-blindness, ranging from an inability to see
colour at all to minor deficiencies seeing specific colours.</p>
<p>Use of colour becomes a barrier for some people when it is used on
its own in a meaningful way. For example, “click the green button to
start and the red button to stop” is going to be problematic for people
who may have trouble seeing greens or reds (the majority of colour-blind
individuals) not to mention problematic for people who are blind. A
solution in a case like this might be to add the word “Start” to the
green button and “Stop” to the red button. Or, in the instructions,
suggest using the first/left/top button to start and using the
second/right/bottom button to stop.</p>
<p>A common issue in web content occurs when error feedback messages are
presented in red or success feedback is presented in green, without some
other indicator of what the text represents. A simple fix might be to
include a checkmark icon with the success feedback (with alt text of
course), and an X icon with an error message. Or, just include the word
“Error” with an error message and “Feedback” or “Warning,” and so on
with other forms of feedback.</p>
<p>Whenever colour is used in a meaningful way, some other element with
equivalent meaning is required. Text as an alternative to colour is
often a good choice.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Since any content that does not meet this

page, all content on the web page (whether or not it is used to meet
other success criteria) must meet this success criterion. See: <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc5">Conformance Requirement 5:
Non-Interference</a>.</p>
</div>
</section>
<h4>Audio Control Explained</h4>
<p>When audio begins playing automatically when a web page loads, it can
make it difficult for screen reader users to navigate. Since they rely
on the output from their screen reader, other sounds playing at the same
time can make it difficult to comprehend either audio stream. Even if
there is a way to stop the automatically played audio, finding the stop
control can be difficult if one has to distinguish between the audio and
the screen reader output in order to find the control.</p>
<p>Though automatically playing audio when a web page loads is
discouraged, in cases where it is necessary you must include a way to
control the audio volume independent of the system’s audio controls,
which also moderates the volume of the screen reader output. Users
should be able to reduce the automatically playing audio volume or turn
it off without affecting the volume of the screen reader.</p>
<p>Web content developers should avoid using the HTML autoplay
attribute.</p>

</ul>
</section>
<h4>Contrast Explained</h4>
<p>For those with low vision or significant colour vision deficiency,
low contrast between text colour and background colour can make reading
difficult or impossible. These may be people with congenital (genetic)
or acquired vision loss, including those with typical reduced visual
acuity associated with aging.</p>
<p>Larger font (e.g., 18+ pt or 14 pt bold) is easier to read at lower
contrast than typical text, like the text you are reading now, so the
required contrast level (a.k.a., relative luminance) can be lower, at a
contrast ratio of 3:1. Typical fonts (e.g., approximately 12 pt or less)
require a higher contrast to be readable for some people, at a minimum
contrast ratio of 4.5:1. These ratios are calculated based on the
contrast required by someone with 20/40 visual acuity to effectively
read text without the assistance of system or software contrast
enhancements (see also: <strong>SC 1.4.6</strong> Contrast
Enhanced).</p>
<p>A common contrast issue occurs when the colour of link text has its
typical underline removed using CSS styles. The resulting link text may
not provide sufficient contrast with the surrounding text. In such
cases, links that are embedded in a paragraph, for instance, become
invisible to many users. The link text may only be discovered by
inadvertently passing a mouse pointer over the link, causing the finger
pointer to appear. Web content developers will often remove the standard
link underline for aesthetic reasons, perhaps not realizing that this
creates a barrier for some people. In contrast, for links in navigation
menus, removing the underline is less of an issue, since the function of
these links is usually obvious. Developers should distinguish between
navigation links and links embedded in content, styling the latter with
an underline. The underline for links is the default, so they have to be
removed intentionally. Developers should avoid removing the underline in
such cases.</p>
<p>Colour contrast is relatively easy to check. There are many tools
available that take codes for foreground (text) and background colours,
then calculate the contrast ratio. These colour codes can be found by
using a tool like ColorZilla or by using a browser’s Inspect Element
window. In order to use Inspect Element, try selecting an element in the
HTML window to the left, then observing the associated colour code in
the CSS window on the right, as seen in the figure below.</p>

<h4>Resize Text Explained</h4>
<p>The goal of this success criteria is to ensure that people with mild
visual disabilities can read content without the need for assistive
technology to magnify text. This group of people includes the large
population of individuals over 50 years of age, who tend to lose visual
acuity with age and often need to increase text size just a little to
make it readable.</p>
<p>Current browsers have a built-in zoom feature that will magnify the
content on a web page, including images, regardless of how they have
been sized. Typically, web content should be sized using relative
measures (em or %) rather than absolute measures (pt or px) to ensure
that elements throughout a page of web content magnify at the same rate.
This includes container elements sized with absolute measures that have
relatively sized text in them. If the container is sized with absolute
measures, they run the risk of text magnifying but the container
remaining the same size. This scenario may result in the magnified text
presented one word per line, making it difficult to read. Or magnified
text may float over or under adjacent text or other elements on the
page, again making it difficult to read.</p>
<p>Relative sizing is also a requirement for responsive designs, which
have become the norm for websites in recent years. Most websites are now
developed in a way that adapt to the size of the screen they are being
viewed on (i.e., they are responsive to screen size). Sizing text with
relative measures thus accommodates people who need larger text to make
it readable and ensures websites adapt effectively for a range of screen
sizes.</p>
<p>Also see <strong>SC 1.4.10</strong> Reflow for more about web content
adapting to screen size.</p>

<h4><strong><span></span>Try This: Using Zoom to Resize
Text</strong></h4>
<p>Open a YouTube video and magnify the content of the page using your
browser’s zoom function (CMD and + on Mac; CTRL and + on Windows).
Notice what zooms and what does not. Depending on the browser you’re
using, you may notice differences in the way browsers magnify
content.</p>
<p>Try this activity with Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Edge
browsers. If testing on Firefox, you can also try zooming on the text
only by selecting “Zoom Text Only” from the View &gt; Zoom menu.</p>
<p>Also, try making the width of your browser narrow. Grab the right
edge of the browser window with your mouse pointer and drag the edge of
the window to the left. Notice whether the content adjusts its layout
and resizes (or does not resize) to fit into the smaller available
space.</p>

</section>
<h4>Images of Text Explained</h4>
<p>Most bitmap (or raster) images are made up of pixels or dots, which
makes these images lose their crisp appearance when magnified. In
contrast, vector-based images consist of points, lines, and curves and
can adapt well to being resized. The vast majority of images on the Web
are bitmap images (png, gif, or jpeg).</p>
<p>When bitmap images contain meaningful text and are magnified, the
letters will typically pixelate, resulting in ragged edges around
letters thereby making text more difficult to read for a person with low
vision using browser-based zooming.</p>
<p>Images of text will also be inaccessible to people who are blind and
using a screen reader to read web content. Screen readers are not able
to extract text from images. While it is possible in some cases to
reproduce the text in the alt text for an image or in a long
description, this won’t accommodate people with low vision.</p>
<p>While there are some cases where images of text are necessary,
generally web content developers should avoid using them. Wherever
possible, actual text should be used. Actual text will magnify while
keeping its crisp appearance, unlike the pixelated text in a magnified
image.</p>
<p>Another reason why web developers may want text instead of images of
text is for search engine indexing. Search engines can index text to
make it searchable, while images of text cannot be indexed, apart from
indexing the associated alt text. Text also uses much less bandwidth
than an image of the same text, an important point for developers who
are conscious of page loading times and bandwidth usage. By opting for
smaller, faster-loading pages, websites can be considerate of data usage
for visitors who may have limited data plans or who may turn off images
to reduce their data consumption.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Per the definition of “decibel,” background
sound that meets this requirement will be approximately four times
quieter than the foreground speech content.</p>
</div>
</section>
<h4>Low or No Background Audio Explained</h4>
<p>This success criteria is intended to ensure that people with mild to
moderate hearing loss are able to distinguish between foreground speech
and background sounds and still understand what is being said. The
optimal approach is not to have background audio. In cases where
background audio is necessary, users should be able to disable the
background audio. Alternatively, you should ensure that there is at
least 20 decibels between speech volume and the volume of the background
audio.</p>
<p>Measuring the separation between foreground speech and background
sounds requires audio editing software. Samples are taken from an audio
track at two instances: when just the background sound is audible and
when both speech and background sounds are audible. Then, the decibel
output of each is compared.</p>
<p>Alternatively, someone with good hearing listens to the speech over
the background sounds, and if there are any parts that require added
attention to comprehend, there is likely less than 20 dB of separation.
For someone with a hearing impairment, those parts will be even more
difficult to comprehend.</p>

</ul>
</section>
<h4>Visual Presentation Explained</h4>
<p>This success criteria essentially requires that the presentation of
blocks of text be adaptable to the text/font preferences of the reader.
This adaptability can benefit people with low vision and people with
some cognitive or learning disabilities.</p>
<p>Some people find it easier to read with non-standard text and
background colours (e.g., yellow on black). Some people with cognitive
or certain learning disabilities will find it easier to read text with a
little extra white space between lines. Others find text easier to read
when spacing between words is consistent, as opposed to variable spacing
in the case of justified text. While the text does not necessarily have
to meet all these requirements by default, it must be possible to
override the default presentation so readers are able to apply their own
styles that meet their particular needs.</p>
<p>Plain text will generally comply with this success criteria. Failures
occur when authors or web developers prevent text from adapting. Here
are more examples of failures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fonts are sized with absolute measures (e.g., px and pt).</li>
<li>Text colours are defined with inline styles or older deprecated HTML
attributes.</li>
<li>Paragraph text is justified with inline styles.</li>
<li>Text container widths are defined in absolute measures.</li>
<li>Font colour is defined but background colour is not, or vice
versa.</li>

<h4>Reflow Explained</h4>
<p>The aim of this success criteria has two parts: (1) Allow people with
significant vision loss, who do not use screen readers or magnifiers, to
magnify web content to 400% using only a browser’s zoom; and (2) allow
content to adapt such that there is no need to scroll left or right (or
to scroll up and down for vertical languages). When scrolling is
required, it can be difficult to move from the end of one line of text
to the start of the next. Also, when scrolling is required, there is
also the risk that content that is not in the visible area of the screen
may go unnoticed.</p>
<p>While reflowing content is very helpful for this group, it is also a
prerequisite for responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes
and orientations.</p>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Responsive design</strong> is an approach to web page
creation that makes use of flexible layouts, flexible images, and
Cascading Style Sheet media queries. The goal of responsive design is to
build web pages that detect the visitor’s screen size and orientation
and change the layout accordingly. (<a href="http://whatis.com">Source:

<p><strong>Viewport</strong> is another name for a browser window, or
for a mobile phone or tablet screen. It is the visible space available
to display a web page. Responsive designs were introduced to accommodate
the wide range of viewport sizes across desktop and mobile device
displays.</p>
</div>
<p>In the figure below, you will see a standard desktop display of the
Ryerson website on the left and a reflow version (responsive) on the
right. Dragging the right side of the browser window to the left to
narrow its width causes the elements on the page to reflow to fit the
available space. Likewise, when using your browser’s zoom to increase
the view to 400%, the content reflows into a single column, so it can be
viewed with ease by someone who needs magnification but does not use an

<p>There are a few exceptions to the reflow rule. Larger images, for
example, that when viewed full width in a desktop browser window at 100%
will flow off the side of the screen when magnified to 400%. Depending
on the content of the image, developers may be able to set the maximum
width of images to 100% of the browser window, so it increases in size
until it reaches the width of the window. You may notice this happening
on the Ryerson website in the activity above.</p>
<p>Data tables are another exception. Header cells and data cells have a
particular relationship that cannot be changed without changing the
meaning in the table. Both images and data tables are out of scope for
this success criteria.</p>

</ul>
</section>
<h4>Non-Text Contrast Explained</h4>
<p>This success criteria builds on <strong>SC 1.4.3</strong> Contrast
Minimum, which ensures text is readable over its background colour,
extending the need for good contrast to <strong>functional
elements</strong> in web content such as links and forms, as well as
other visual elements such as icons, graphs or charts, and infographics,
among <strong>other graphical objects</strong>.</p>
<p>Take links, for example. It is common for web content developers to
remove the underline from links for aesthetic reasons. In some cases,
removing the underline is okay, when the function of links, such as
links in a menu, is obvious to the users. Often link text is blue by
default, which over a typical white background will provide sufficient
contrast to be readable. However, readers may not be able to distinguish
between the blue link text (with the underline removed) and the
surrounding black paragraph text. Such links may go unnoticed. The
default contrast between the link colour and the surrounding text colour
will fail this success criteria.</p>
<p>Another common non-text contrast issue occurs when disabled buttons
are greyed out to indicate they are not functional. This may very well
be desirable to de-emphasize the button until a particular task is
complete or data entered, for example. But it may also create a barrier
for low-vision users who may not be able to effectively see the disabled
button to know that some task needs to be completed before continuing.
In such a case, there are competing needs between those who can see and
those who may have difficulty seeing. If higher contrast is required to
make the disabled button more visible, it may make the disabled state
less distinguishable for those who can see the buttons.</p>
<p>Readers should refer to <strong>SC 1.3.5</strong> and <strong>SC
1.3.6</strong> for more about potential solutions to competing needs.
Icons, for example, might be used in the future with disabled elements,
so those who may not be able to see the element have an alternative
available through a preference setting that inserts an icon where a
disabled element is present.</p>

</section>
<h4>Text Spacing Explained</h4>
<p>You were introduced to text sizing in <strong>SC 1.4.4</strong>
Resize Text and in <strong>SC 1.4.8</strong> Visual Presentation, both
of which ensure that readers are able to modify the presentation of text
to make it more readable. <strong>SC 1.4.12</strong> builds on
customizing text properties, adding line height, paragraph spacing,
letter spacing, and word spacing to that mix.</p>
<p>This success criteria does not require authors to set these text
properties. It requires that they do not prevent users from setting
them. It is users who are responsible for applying these properties
though tools such as <a
href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-css/okpjlejfhacmgjkmknjhadmkdbcldfcb?hl=en">User
CSS</a>, introduced earlier. Much like sizing with relative measures (%,
em), as discussed with <strong>SC 1.4.4</strong>, relative sizing should
be used for line height and for paragraph, letter, and word spacing. In
this way, all elements related to text presentation, including text
containers, increase in size at the same rate, rather than floating over
adjacent text or floating under an adjacent image or text container, for
example.</p>
<p>Similarly, older HTML attributes, such as height and width, should be
avoided, as well as inline styles controlling these properties when
defining text sizes. The same is true for the four properties associated
with this success criteria. HTML attributes and inline styles can make
it difficult or impossible for users to adjust text presentation to
their liking.</p>

<p>Level AA</p>
<p>Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus
triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the
following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dismissable</strong>: A <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-mechanism">mechanism</a> is
available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover
or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an <a

does not obscure or replace other content;</li>
<li><strong>Hoverable</strong>: If pointer hover can trigger the

<li><strong>Persistent</strong>: The additional content remains visible
until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or
its information is no longer valid.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exception:</strong> The visual presentation of the additional

author.</p>
<div

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Custom tooltips, submenus, and other non-modal
popups that display on hover and focus are examples of additional
content covered by this criterion.</p>
</div>
</section>
<h4>Content on Hover or Focus Explained</h4>
<p><strong>SC 1.4.13</strong> Content on Hover or Focus applies to
elements like tooltips, popup menus, and other non-modal dialogs (i.e.,
popups). Modal dialogs are covered under <strong>SC 1.3.2</strong>
Meaningful Sequence and should not open on hover or focus.</p>
<p>As described in the success criteria above, when a tooltip or small
dialog window opens with a definition, for example, users must be
<strong>able to dismiss the new content</strong> without having to move
the mouse or having to move focus away from the element that triggered
the popup content. This is typically accomplished by scripting the
<strong>Escape key to dismiss</strong> the content. This allows a user
who may have screen magnification set high (e.g., 400% or more) to
dismiss a popup that is accidentally opened when a mouse pointer or
keyboard focus inadvertently hits a trigger, without being forced to
navigate away and potentially lose their place in the original
content.</p>
<p>Users must also be able to move the mouse pointer away from the
trigger to <strong>hover in the popup content</strong>, without losing
the popup when focus on the trigger is removed. Users who have their
screen magnified may need to drag their mouse pointer away from the
trigger and off the side of the visible screen, in order to bring the
whole popup into view.</p>
<p>Finally, popup <strong>content must persist until the user explicitly
dismisses it</strong>. It can take longer for some people with
disabilities to read content, so this tactic ensures there is enough
time to read through the content of the popup before it disappears.</p>
<section
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #b9f">
<h4><strong><span></span>Try This: Dismissing Tooltips</strong></h4>
<p>In the example below, users can dismiss the tooltips by moving focus
away from the triggers, accessing another trigger, or pressing the
Escape key. Tooltips persist by clicking the trigger, until clicking
out, pressing the Escape key, or clicking another trigger.</p>

content poses different types of potential barriers for different groups
with disabilities. There are three potential adaptations for multimedia
content that can make it accessible to a broader range of users. These
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closed captions</li>
<li>Audio description (and extended audio description)</li>
<li>Transcripts</li>
</ul>
<p>These elements can often be combined to produce video content that is
adaptable to a wide range of users. Though audio description for
multimedia is an exception in Ontario, many jurisdictions will require
it. In Ontario, what might have gone into audio descriptions can be
added as text to closed captions instead. These descriptions are often
included in [square brackets] to indicate their function within
captions, distinguishing them from the spoken dialogue of the video.
These can include a description of the setting, visual activity in the
video, names of people speaking, and any other important information
that one may not be able to determine from listening to the video’s
audio track.</p>
<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>In this activity, you will produce closed captions for
<strong><em>one minute of video</em></strong> (or the full video if it
is shorter than one minute).</p>
<h3>Use the Amara Caption Editor (Recommended)</h3>
<p><a href="https://amara.org">Amara Caption Editor</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select a video to caption.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a short video on YouTube that has spoken dialogue.</li>
<li>The video must not be captioned or is captioned using automated
captioning. (Be sure the video is family friendly.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Get set up to caption a video on Amara.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an account on <a href="https://amara.org">Amara</a> (if you
don’t already have one) and log in.</li>
<li>Click on “Subtitling Platform” located in the navigation menu across
the top of the site.</li>
<li>On the page that opens, scroll down to the “Get Started” section
near the bottom of the page and click on “Create.”</li>
<li>On the next page, you’ll see the “Subtitle a Video” form. Enter the
URL to the video you will be captioning, and press “Begin” next to the
URL field.</li>
<li>On the first screen of the caption editor, choose “Add a new
language.” In the subtitle dialogue box that follows, select a language
for both the video and the subtitles. Then, press “Continue.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Caption the video.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are now ready to start typing the captions. Remember, if there
are important visuals or contextual information, use square brackets to
add descriptions where possible.</li>
<li>Once you have created captions, synchronize them with the video, and
review the captions for accuracy. Press the “Publish” button in the
final step.</li>
<li>If you need more instructions, watch the following video that
describes how Amara works.<br />

data-preview-alt="Captioning with Amara">Captioning with Amara</a>©
Captioning Course Online. Released under the terms of a Standard YouTube
License. All rights reserved.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Download the captions file, and create a
transcript file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now that the captions are published, the caption file can be
downloaded through the “Download” drop-down menu near the top of the
published captions.</li>
<li>Download the SRT caption file.</li>
<li>Make a copy of the caption file and rename it “transcript.” Open the
file in a plain text editor. Remove all the time stamps to produce the
transcript for the video.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Use YouTube Studio (Alternative)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/dashboard?o=U&amp;ar=2">YouTube
Studio</a> (Login)</p>
<p>If you already have a YouTube account and have videos of your own
there, you can produce your captions using the YouTube Caption editor
instead.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to YouTube.</li>
<li>Open YouTube Studio.</li>
<li>Open Videos from the navigation menu on the left.</li>
<li>In the list of videos, click the video you’ll caption to open the
editor.</li>
<li>Click on “Transcriptions” in the menu on the left.</li>
<li>In the list of transcripts that opens, click on “Add” in the
Subtitles column, to open the caption editor.</li>
<li>In the caption editor click “Create new subtitles or CC.”</li>
<li>Review the “Keyboard shortcuts” above the video player.</li>
<li>Type your captions into the subtitle text entry field.</li>
<li>When complete, under the Actions menu, choose Download (which
produces a SBV caption file).</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: YouTube updates fairly regularly, and the new YouTube Studio
was in beta at the time of writing. As a result the instructions above,
and the labels described, may vary from what is currently available on
YouTube. Explore, if necessary, to find the caption or subtitle editor
if the above instructions have become outdated.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>If you are completing this activity as part of a course, your
instructor may ask you to submit your work. Your submission should
contain two parts (or as instructed by your instructor):</p>
<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Your captioning work</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy and paste about 15 lines from the <strong>caption</strong>
file.</li>
<li>Copy and paste about 15 lines from the <strong>transcript</strong>
file.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part 2: </strong>A few lines or a paragraph about your
experience using the caption editor</p>
<p>Some questions you might answer in your paragraph:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you have any difficulties?</li>
<li>Were you able to effectively use the editor’s navigation keys?</li>
<li>How long did it take you to caption 1 minute of video (or whatever
the length of the video is, stating the video length)?</li>
<li>Did you get faster at captioning with practice?</li>
<li>What other thoughts do you have about the caption editor and the
process of captioning?</li>

<li>Make it possible to perform all tasks with a keyboard in addition to
a mouse.</li>
<li>Give users enough time to perform tasks.</li>

<h4>Keyboard Explained</h4>
<p>The computer mouse is ubiquitous today, but before 1984 most computer
users did not use one. The mouse only became pervasive during the
mid–1990s. In recent years, other mouse-like devices have been
introduced, including trackballs, touchpads, and trackpoints. Now, a
mouse (or a similar pointing device) comes with every computer, and most
people would be lost without one.</p>
<p>Yet some people cannot use — or have difficulties using — a mouse.
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>An individual with low-vision may have trouble locating the mouse
pointer on a screen</li>
<li>A person who is totally blind cannot see the mouse pointer at
all</li>
<li>Someone with a learning disability may find the movements of the
mouse pointer distracting</li>
<li>A person who has hand tremors may be unable to hold the mouse
steadily enough to click on small screen objects</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there are individuals who find that pressing a few keys
on the keyboard is faster, easier, and more accurate than pointing and
clicking. Many “average” computer users know a few keyboard shortcuts,
and some “power users” rarely touch the mouse at all.</p>
<p>Many tasks that are typically done with a mouse can be (or should be)
easily keyboard accessible, including “clicking” hypertext links,
drawing straight lines and regular geometric shapes, and resizing
windows. There are even keyboard equivalents for dragging and dropping.
But when a task cannot be performed without a mouse, some people will be
prevented from taking full advantage of a site.</p>
<p>WCAG 2.1 acknowledges that some tasks cannot reasonably be done with
a keyboard, such as real-time flight simulations. Tasks that depend on
continuous, time-sensitive movements that do not have start and end
points are excluded. But the highest conformance level that such a
website can attain for <strong>Guideline 2.1</strong> is Level A. To
achieve Level AAA, all content must be keyboard accessible. Also, see
<strong>SC 2.1.3</strong> Keyboard (No Exceptions).</p>
<p>Many of the assistive technologies that people with disabilities rely
upon emulate the functionality of a keyboard. Content that is accessible
by keyboard can also be accessed by devices that emulate keyboards. For
this reason, the ability to interact with web content using only a
keyboard is core to web accessibility.</p>

important as <strong>SC 1.1.1</strong> Text Alternatives. If neither are
addressed, a website will have insurmountable barriers that some users

<h4><strong><span></span>Try This: Keyboard Accessible
Drag-and-Drop</strong></h4>
<p>One common keyboard-inaccessible culprit around the Web is
drag-and-drop widgets. Developers often have trouble making these
accessible, though there are a number of strategies available to make
them usable with a screen reader.</p>
<p>The following two examples of drag-and-drop sortable lists may look
identical, but there is one difference. Mouse users will find that both
function exactly the same way; however, for keyboard users, only the
first one is accessible.</p>
<p>To test each sortable list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open ChromeVox or your preferred screen reader.</li>
<li>Using your mouse pointer (if you are able), grab one of the list
items from each list and drop it in a new position.</li>
<li>Listen to what the screen reader announces in each case.</li>
<li>Now put your mouse away, and use your keyboard to complete the same
task.</li>
<li>Mac users use Command + arrow to select and move list items. Windows
users use Ctrl + arrow.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that there is no way to reorder the list using a keyboard
alone in the second example below. The first example would pass, and the
latter would fail accessibility testing.</p>
<p>Also, notice how the screen reader announces the accessible version.
These semantics are created using WAI-ARIA. WAI-ARIA will be covered in
more detail later in later unit and will be covered in great detail in
our <a href="https://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/wafd">Web
Accessibility for Developers</a> book.</p>

<h4>No Keyboard Trap Explained</h4>
<p>A “keyboard trap” is an area of a web page where a person gets stuck
when navigating without a mouse. You can navigate to a spot by pressing
a sequence of keystrokes, but you cannot leave — unless you use a
mouse.</p>
<p>Keyboard traps usually occur when applications are embedded in web
pages. The main culprits are text editors, spreadsheets, and media
players. For example, on some online forums, it is possible to navigate
to a built-in text editor by repeatedly pressing the Tab key but
impossible to exit it without a mouse.</p>
<p>If there is a non-intuitive keystroke (or series of keystrokes) to
escape a keyboard trap, let users know about it. One option would be to
provide instructions within the embedded application: “To exit this
spreadsheet, press Ctrl + W (Windows) or Command + W (Mac).”</p>

<p>If a <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-keyboard-shortcuts">keyboard
shortcut</a> is implemented in content using only letter (including
upper- and lower-case), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then
at least one of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn off</strong>: A <a

available to turn the shortcut off.</li>
<li><strong>Remap</strong>: A mechanism is available to remap the

Ctrl, Alt, etc).</li>
<li><strong>Active only on focus</strong>: The keyboard shortcut for
a <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-interface-components">user
interface component</a> is only active when that component has
focus.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>Character Key Shortcuts Explained</h4>
<p>This success criteria was introduced in WCAG 2.1 to take into account
a growing awareness of the need for keyboard access on the Web, for both
desktop and mobile applications. It is intended to address access via
single, printable keyboard characters, including numbers, letters, and
punctuation used to control websites and web application features. An
example might be using the “F” key to open a File menu.</p>
<p>While these shortcuts can be very handy for keyboard-only users, they
can be quite problematic for voice users, using speech recognition
software to control their computer or mobile device. When using speech
recognition software, it is typically possible to switch between command
and dictation modes, which can be quite inefficient. Speech users will
often use an all-encompassing mode, with pauses between dictation and
commands. However, if the pause is too short, commands may end up being
dictated into a form or document. These types of errors are typically
easy to revert and are more an annoyance than a barrier.</p>
<p>Real problems occur when spoken words in command mode fire off a
series of commands associated with the letters in a word. It can be even
more problematic when spoken words are picked up in the background,
especially from other speakers. The result can completely disorient a
user. Watch the following video to see what happens when spoken words
are interpreted as commands.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/xzSyIA4OWYE">Single
key shortcuts affecting speech input</a> by Kim Patch</p>
<p>To prevent these types of occurrences, keyboard commands programmed
into websites and web applications can include a non-printable character
key as a modifier, much like Alt, or Ctrl, or Alt + Ctrl together as the
ChromeVox modifier keys. Or, if single characters are to be used, a
feature is available to disable character keys or remap them, which
allows users to define their own key combinations for various
controls.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> This success criteria does not affect the
use of HTML access keys because they will always include a non-printable
character key as a modifier, such as Alt or Ctrl. It applies only when
single character keys are used, typically keys that are scripted for
controls in web applications.</p>

<h2><strong>Guideline 2.2</strong> Enough Time</h2>
<p>Provide users enough time to read and use content.</p>
</section>
<p><strong>Why do some people need extra time on the Web?</strong></p>
<p>Individuals who rely on assistive technologies often need time to
find what they are looking for on a web page. For example, sighted users
can understand a page at a glance, but screen reader users often need to
explore a page before they understand how the page is organized.</p>
<p>As people age, they need more time to process information. In
addition to helping seniors, flexible time limits benefit individuals

systems, or are not native speakers of the language on the site.</p>

Criterion 2.2.1</strong> Timing Adjustable</h3>
<p>Level A</p>
<p>For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the
following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn off</strong>: The user is allowed to turn off the time
limit before encountering it; or</li>
<li><strong>Adjust</strong>: The user is allowed to adjust the time

times the length of the default setting; or</li>
<li><strong>Extend</strong>: The user is warned before time expires and
given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action
(for example, “press the space bar”), and the user is allowed to extend
the time limit at least ten times; or</li>
<li><strong>Real-time exception</strong>: The time limit is a required
part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative
to the time limit is possible; or</li>
<li><strong>Essential exception</strong>: The time limit is <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential">essential</a> and
extending it would invalidate the activity; or</li>
<li><strong>20-hour exception</strong>: The time limit is longer than 20

</ul>
</section>
<h4>Timing Adjustable Explained</h4>
<p>People who have disabilities sometimes need more time to complete
tasks than people who do not have disabilities. They may need longer to
think, remember, read, react physically, or zero in on pertinent
information. Or they may rely on assistive technologies that increase
the time they need to write or read.</p>
<p>Additionally, as people age, they may need more time to process
information. Flexible time limits help many people, not only seniors. It
also benefits individuals who are not technically savvy or who are new
to electronic information systems.</p>
<p><strong>SC 2.2.1</strong> lists three ways to ensure that people are
not prevented from completing tasks due to lack of time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to turn off time limits</li>
<li>Allow users to increase the default time limit</li>
<li>Give users ample warning when their time is about to expire</li>
</ul>
<p>Exceptions are allowed. For example, it may not be possible to change
time limits for time-sensitive events, such as online auctions or tests
that measure reaction speed.</p>
<p>In situations that are not time sensitive, 20 hours is given as an
upper time limit.</p>

<p>Level A</p>
<p>For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of
the following are true:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moving, blinking, scrolling</strong>: For any moving,
blinking, or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2)
lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with
other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide
it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity
where it is essential; and</li>
<li><strong>Auto-updating</strong>: For any auto-updating information
that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with
other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide
it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is
part of an activity where it is essential.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>Pause, Stop, Hide Explained</h4>
<p>This section applies when content conveys a sense of motion or
updates itself automatically. Content that moves or changes may distract
some users.</p>
<p>Examples of content that conveys a sense of motion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animations</li>
<li>Movies</li>
<li>Games</li>
<li>Scrolling stock tickers</li>
</ul>
<p>Automatically updating content is often confined to one area of a web
page. Familiar examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock market updates</li>
<li>Weather updates</li>
<li>News updates</li>
<li>Slide shows that automatically advance from one slide to the
next</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two requirements to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When content conveys a sense of motion:</strong> If the
moving content starts automatically, lasts longer than five seconds, and
is presented in parallel with other content, include a mechanism that
allows users to pause, stop, or hide the content.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>When content automatically updates itself:</strong> If
content begins the update cycle automatically and is presented in
parallel with other content, include a mechanism that allows users to
pause, stop, hide the content, or control the update frequency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are three <strong>examples of how to meet this
requirement:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A website has an animation that demonstrates how to use a fire
extinguisher. The animation has “pause” and “restart” buttons.</li>
<li>A website has an advertisement. To draw attention, the advertisement
starts to blink when a page loads. But the blinking stops after five
seconds.</li>
<li>A blog features a slide show of the author’s bicycle trip through
the Alps. Next to the slide show is a control that lets visitors adjust
the update speed, from zero seconds to 30 seconds per slide.</li>

<h4>No Timing Explained</h4>
<p>Many people need extra time to perform tasks. Some individuals take
longer to think, remember, process information, react physically, or
deal with the quirks of assistive technologies. If completing a task
within a time limit is not essential, then give people all the time they
need.</p>
<p>This requirement does not apply to events that occur in real time,
such as fast-paced auctions, multiplayer gaming sites, and similar
competitive events.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of how this requirement can be met: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>An online test:</strong> Students can take as much time as
they need to complete the questions.</li>
<li><strong>A game:</strong> A game is designed to allow players to
compete against the clock or to take turns. When they take turns, there
are no time limits.</li>
<li><strong>An online auction:</strong> Each bidder is allowed to submit
one bid. Bids are accepted over 24 hours. Once the bidding is closed,
the highest bid wins.</li>

<p>Level AAA</p>
<p>Interruptions can be postponed or suppressed by the user, except
interruptions involving an <a

</section>
<h4>Interruptions Explained</h4>
<p>Some websites feature late-breaking news, weather reports, stock
quotes, and so on that update regularly. There are people, however, who
are distracted by frequent updates or do not want them.</p>
<p>Let users postpone automatic updates by giving them the option to
disable automatic content updates and/or to specify the frequency of
automatic content updates.</p>
<p>For example, the homepage of a news service displays headline updates
every 15 minutes. To meet this requirement, the web authors added a
drop-down list so that visitors can choose how often to refresh
headlines. It has four options: every 15, 30, 60 minutes, or never.</p>
<p>A common error that fails this success criterion occurs when
developers use the refresh meta tag to reload the whole page at a set
interval to update the content. This can be highly disruptive for some
assistive technology users, and, for some people with a cognitive
disability, causing them to lose their position in the content, forcing
them to start over from the top of the page when it reloads.</p>
<p>It is okay to update the content in the event of an emergency,
including threats to life, health, safety, or property.</p>

<h4>Re-Authentication Explained</h4>
<p>Completing forms, entering credit card information, and using
web-based email programs are everyday activities on the Internet. For
security reasons, websites usually limit the period of inactivity before
a session expires. These time limits cause problems for people who need
extra time to input information, especially when they are forced to
begin “from scratch” every time.</p>
<p>Make it possible for visitors to continue a transaction after a
session expires without losing the information they already entered.
Doing this will allow more people to complete authenticated
transactions.</p>
<p>Samantha Smith, who has limited use of her hands, logs in to a
shopping site. She chooses groceries and proceeds to the checkout. It
takes her so long to type her credit card number that the session
expires. After logging in again, her grocery order is intact, and the
check-out screen contains all of the information that she had entered up
to the point that the session expired. No data was lost because the
server stored her submission even though the session had timed out.</p>

<h4>Timeouts Explained</h4>
<p>This success criterion extends <strong>SC 2.2.1</strong> Timing
Adjustable in cases where a timeout is necessary and where other means
of managing time limits described in <strong>SC 2.2.1</strong> are not
provided. In such cases, keep in mind the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Users must be informed at the start of
a session about what period of inactivity will cause a timeout.</li>
<li><strong>Exception: </strong>When data is preserved for 20 hours or
more after a timeout occurs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes it possible for people with disabilities, as well as older
users who may need to take breaks, to potentially complete online
activities over multiple sessions without losing their data.</p>
<p>Shopping online is a good example where this success criteria can
benefit many users, including people who do not have a disability. Users
can typically add items to a “shopping cart” and return later to
complete the transaction.</p>
<p>This success criteria does not apply to timeouts that are out of the
control of the provider, such as a user closing a browser window or
reloading it while it contains unsaved data.</p>

<h2><strong>Guideline 2.3</strong> Seizures and Physical Reactions</h2>
<p>Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or

</section>
<p><strong>What do I need to know so that content does not cause
seizures?</strong></p>
<p>People who have epilepsy can have seizures when exposed to flashing
or flickering lights. There are three causes of flickering lights on
computer screens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flashes can be caused by the display.</li>
<li>Flashes can be caused by the computer and how it renders images and

<li>Flashes can be caused by the content itself.</li>

<p>Although web authors have no control over the first two, they can
ensure that flicker is not caused by the content, such as a movie of
strobe flashes or an animation of rapid-fire explosions.</p>
<p>To conform at Level AA, WCAG 2.1 describes how to determine safe
values for flashing content. To conform at Level AAA, a page must avoid
all flashing content.</p>

</section>
<h4>Three Flashes or Below Threshold Explained</h4>
<p>People with a form of epilepsy called photosensitive seizure disorder
have seizures when exposed to flashing or flickering lights. Many
colours can cause these seizures, but flashing red lights are known to
trigger seizures more readily than other colours, and the larger the
area flashing, the greater the possibility of inducing a seizure.</p>
<p>To meet this requirement, web authors must ensure that flickering is
not caused by the content itself, such as a movie of strobe flashes or
an animation with rapidly switching colours.</p>
<p><strong>SC 2.3.1</strong> allows content to flash if it is dim enough
and confined to a small area. W3C publishes formulas for determining
safe values for “general flash” and “red flash” thresholds. But even
these so-called safe values can trigger seizures. Research suggests the
greatest sensitivity to flashing is between 10 hz and 25 hz. The next
section, <strong>SC2.3.2</strong>, is more stringent.</p>
<section
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #b9f">
<h4><strong>Try This: Flashing Screens</strong></h4>
<p>Humans can only detect flashing (i.e., the flicker rate) up to about
50 hz (or 50 flashes per second), after which a screen or content
appears continuous. You may recall seeing computer or television screens
flickering or the rolling bar that cycles across the screen in cases
where a monitor is being viewed in a video or TV program. The cause is
the difference in the flash rate of the monitor and the flash rate of
the camera recording the monitor.</p>
<p>Even though you cannot see it due to the flash rate being faster than
the eye can detect, all screens do flicker.</p>
<p>See the flash of a video recorded monitor:</p>

<h4>Three Flashes Explained</h4>
<p>Some people are so sensitive that it is not possible to completely
prevent them from having seizures. However, by eliminating all flashing
between three and 50 flashes per second everywhere on the screen, the
chances of a person having a seizure are reduced.</p>
<p><strong>SC 2.3.1</strong> Three Flashes or Below Threshold (Level A)
allows flashing if it is dim enough or is confined to a small enough
area. <strong>SC 2.3.2</strong> (Level AAA) does not allow flashing at
all between three and 50 flashes per second, regardless of brightness or
size.</p>
<p>Even a single flashing pixel violates this criterion. The intent is
to guard against flashing areas that are larger than a single pixel;
but, since an individual may require magnification or high contrast
settings, the prohibition is against any flashing.</p>

<h4>Animation from Interactions Explained</h4>
<p>While <strong>SC 2.2.2</strong> Pause, Stop, Hide (Level A) addresses
animation that is part of web content, <strong>SC 2.3.3</strong>
Animation from Interactions (Level AAA) addresses cases where movement
occurs on the screen as a result of the user interacting with the
content.</p>
<p>People with <strong>vestibular disorders</strong>, which affect eye
movement and balance control, may become dizzy (vertigo) or experience
nausea or headaches when encountering content of significant size moving
across their visual field. Rapidly paging through an ebook mimics the
effect. A similar effect is motion sickness caused by looking out a side
window of a moving car. Effects can be quite severe, potentially causing
vomiting and requiring bed rest to reduce the symptoms.</p>
<p>As a result, any user-initiated animation should be avoided, or users
should be provided with a way to disable such animations.</p>
<p>This success criteria does not apply to essential user-initiated
animation. Scrolling, for example, is essential. In this case, users are
in control and can adjust their scrolling speed to avoid any
motion-related symptoms.</p>
<p>One form of motion in web content that is known to initiate
vestibular dysfunction is parallax scrolling. This occurs when, while
scrolling, the foreground and background scroll at different rates. If
there is a significant difference in the scrolling rate, vestibular
symptoms can be brought on.</p>

<p>If you have not experienced motion sickness before, this activity may
not affect you. For many, though, animations like the following, when
stared at for a period of time, can make them feel queasy. For those

<p><strong>Why is it important to help visitors navigate?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>To tell users where they are.</li>
<li>To let users know how to go somewhere else.</li>
</ol>
<p>These tasks are often more difficult for people with disabilities.

Criterion 2.4.1</strong> Bypass Blocks</h3>
<p>Level A</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-mechanism">mechanism</a>
is available to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on
multiple <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s">web
pages</a>.</p>
</section>
<h4>Bypass Blocks Explained</h4>
<p>People who cannot use a mouse often use the Tab key to navigate
around web pages: they press Tab to move “forward” through the content;
Shift + Tab to move “backward”; and Enter to activate links and buttons.
At best, Tab key navigation is a tedious way to get around, but for some
non-mouse users, it is the best option.</p>
<p>Many web pages have content that is repeated on every page. For
example, a site may have the same navigation links on the top of all
pages. If there are 20 navigation links, a non-mouse user could be
forced to press the Tab key 20 times just to reach the main content —
and do this on every page.</p>
<p>By meeting this requirement, keyboard users can go directly to the
main content without the need to press a lot of keys. A simple way to
achieve this is to place a “Skip to Content” link as the first link on
every page.</p>
<p>“Skip to Content” links also benefit people who use portable
web-enabled devices, such as cell phones. Because the screens of these
devices are so small, it may be more convenient to click a “Skip to
Content” link than to scroll through many screens to reach the
content.</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to provide navigation elements that allow
non-mouse users to navigate effectively and reduce or eliminate the need
to navigate through web content in the sequence elements appearing on
the page. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bypass Links</strong>: Skip to Content is one type of bypass
link, typically located in the top left corner of the page. When a
bypass link is followed, focus moves to an anchor elsewhere on the page,
skipping past content in between the link and anchor. Bypass links can
also be used with other complex elements within the content of a page,
such as skipping over a large data table or past an embedded object or
application.</li>
<li><strong>Headings</strong>: When proper HTML headings are used in web
content, assistive technology users are able to list them and navigate
directly to any one of them, skipping over any content in between the
location in focus on the page, and the heading farther down the page.
Using proper headings is perhaps the easiest way to meet <strong>SC
2.4.1 </strong>(Level A), if the site already meets <strong>SC
1.3.1</strong> Info and Relationships (Level A).</li>
<li><strong>Landmarks</strong>: With the introduction of WAI-ARIA, site
developers can add specific roles to regions of the page that screen
reader users are able to list and then use to navigate directly to a
block with a navigation menu, to the main content area of the page, or
to the footer area, among other potential regions. See the link in the
suggested readings below for more about landmarks</li>
</ul>
<p>All three of these strategies can be used together to accommodate a
broad range of users. For instance, landmarks may work well for screen
reader users but not so well for low-vision users who may not be using a
screen reader. Bypass links may be a more effective means for the latter
group.</p>

Criterion 2.4.2</strong> Page Titled</h3>
<p>Level A</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s">Web pages</a>
have titles that describe topic or purpose.</p>
</section>
<h4>Page Titled Explained</h4>
<p>When a screen reader begins reading a page after it has finished
loading, the first thing it reads is the page title. A descriptive title
immediately tells the listener they are in the right place (or in the
wrong place). Without the title, users have to navigate into the page
before making that determination.</p>
<p>For most current browsers, holding a mouse pointer over a tab across
the top of the browser window reveals the title of the page being
viewed. The title is added to a web page using the HTML
<code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element.</p>
<p>A good title summarizes a page in a few words, so users do not have
to read an entire page to know what it is about. Many screen reader
users take advantage of titles to keep track of where they are. A title
may be based on the main heading on the page, then followed by the name
of the site. If not the same as the main heading, the title should be
equivalent in meaning to it. When linking to a page, the link text may
be the same as the title of the page the link leads to, thus users can
make a direct association between the link they clicked and the page
that opens.</p>
<p>Descriptive titles also help people interpret search engine results.
Many search engines, including Google, display search results as a list
of page titles. Not using descriptive titles can also affect a website’s
searchability, and its search ranking, whether it appears near the top
of the results for a related search query or not.</p>
<p>When writing web page titles, it is recommended that each title:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify the subject of the page.</li>
<li>Identify the site.</li>
<li>Make sense.</li>
<li>Be short.</li>
<li>Be unique for each page.</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="example">
<p>Examples of descriptive titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a page containing a chocolate brownie recipe on <a
href="http://www.yummydesserts.com">www.yummydesserts.com</a>:<br />
<strong><em>Chocolate Brownie Recipe – Yummy Desserts</em></strong></li>
<li>For a chapter in a textbook called “Gender and Stereotype”:<br />
<strong><em>Chapter 3: The Origins of Patriarchy – Gender and
Stereotype</em></strong></li>
<li>For a web-based banking application that lets customers retrieve
monthly statements:<br />
<strong><em>Account 10001, Statement for October 2010 – Bank of Hudson
Bay</em></strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>It is advisable to position the subject of a page before the name of
the site in a page title, just in case the title is truncated to fit
available space. Placing the subject before the site/page title allows
that unique topic to be informatively displayed in search results or in
a browser tab, if the latter part of the title gets truncated.</p>

Criterion 2.4.3</strong> Focus Order</h3>
<p>Level A</p>
<p>If a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s">web
page</a> can be <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-navigated-sequentially">navigated
sequentially</a> and the navigation sequences affect meaning or
operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves
meaning and operability.</p>
</section>
<h4>Focus Order Explained</h4>
<p>Content should make sense when navigating by keyboard. Many people
who cannot handle (or have difficulty handling) a mouse rely on
<strong>Tab-key navigation</strong> to interact with a web page. That
is, they press Tab to move forward through the content; Shift + Tab to
move backwards; and Enter to activate links and buttons. Knowing a
handful of other hotkeys (keyboard shortcuts) makes it possible for
non-mouse users to interact with any web page.</p>
<p>When navigating through a web page via keyboard, people should
encounter information in a logical order. This is especially important
for screen reader users, who cannot observe how pages are visually
organized. When designing for the Web, strive to make the visual
organization and the tabbing order correspond.</p>
<section
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #b9f">
<h4><strong><span></span>Try This: Logical Focus Order</strong></h4>
<p>Here you have two login forms that look identical. However, the first
is created with default HTML, which results in the focus order being
illogical for someone listening with a screen reader. When encountering
such a form, one might be expected to register first, then login by
entering a username, then a password, choose the optional auto-login,
then press the sign-in button to complete the login.</p>
<p><strong>Illogical focus order:</strong></p>
<p>The focus order for this form does NOT follow a logical sequence. Use
the Tab key to navigate through this first form.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Programmatically determined:</strong> Code is used to
associate a link with additional meaning. This could be via a preceding
link, as described below or through other means, such as a WAI-ARIA

added meaning in each of these is available to assistive technologies
when they encounter a link.</p>
</div>
<h4>Link Purpose (in Context) Explained</h4>
<p>Links that make sense by themselves enhance usability for everybody.
The preferred way to meet the requirement is to write link text that
clearly indicates what to expect if the link is followed.</p>

<p>While using meaningful words that describe the destination of a link
is always recommended, this success criteria does allow the use of less
meaningful words, provided there is context that adds meaning to those
words. <strong>SC 2.1.4</strong> refers to the phrase “programmatically
determined,” which means essentially, assistive technologies are able to
gather meaning from the context in which a link appears, giving the link
meaning.</p>
<p>For example: Imagine a news website, like the one in the screenshot
below, that presents a series of news headlines. Each headline is
followed by a sentence or two to introduce the article, followed by a
“continue reading” link that leads to the full article. The words
“continue reading” on their own do not contain any useful information
about the article; however, if the article title that precedes the
meaningless link is also a link to the article, users navigating through
the links on the page will hear the title followed by “continue
reading,” in which case the article title gives meaning to the otherwise
meaningless link, by answering “continue reading what?”</p>

<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Though the W3C description for <strong>SC
2.4.4</strong> suggests that text in a surrounding paragraph can add
meaning to an otherwise meaningless link embedded in the paragraph,
technically this means of providing context is not “programmatically
determined.” In other words a user would need to manually search through
the surrounding content to determine the destination of a “click here”
link, for example. They would not be able to gather that information
from the link itself, as in the programmatically determined link
contexts described above.</p>
<p>In the two examples that follow, the first is a typically frowned
upon “click here” link that based on the W3C description of the success
criteria, passes the requirements as described. The reality is, however,
this creates unnecessary effort for assistive technology users, who may
be “tabbing” through the links on the page.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad</strong> (Passes according to WCAG, but requires extra
effort)<br />
Learning more about meaningful links, <span>click here</span>.</li>
<li><strong>Good</strong> (No context needed, link text good as
is)<br />
Learn more <span>about meaningful links</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only do those using assistive technology require extra effort to
determine the meaning of “click here,” anyone, with a disability or not,
who may be scanning the links on a page, will have to read through the
surrounding content to determine the destination of the link.</p>
</div>
<p>By meeting this requirement, a site conforms at Level A. To conform
at Level AAA, see <strong>SC 2.4.9</strong>.</p>

a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-processes">process</a>.</p>
</section>
<h4>Multiple Ways Explained</h4>
<p>Different people use different ways to focus in on particular content
on a website: some prefer site maps; others like navigation links or
breadcrumbs; still, others rely on site searches.</p>
<p>Make it possible for visitors to your site to find content in at
least two ways. Choose from among these techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>A site map</li>
<li>A site search</li>
<li>A table of contents</li>
<li>Links on the homepage to all pages on the site</li>
<li>Links to all other pages on the site</li>
<li>Links to navigate to related web pages</li>
</ul>
<p>An exception applies when content is not “findable.” A banking
website, for example, lets customers transfer funds between accounts.
The page that confirms the transfer is exempt because the page does not
exist until the customer completes the transfer. WCAG 2.1 acknowledges
that pages that are “the result of, or a step in, a process” do not need
to conform to <strong>SC 2.4.5</strong>.</p>

</section>
<h4>Headings and Labels Explained</h4>
<p>When headings and labels are clear and descriptive, they help users
understand what information is contained in web pages and how that
information is organized. Much like meaningful link text describes the
destination of a link, meaningful headings describe a section or
paragraph that follows, and meaningful labels describe the purpose or
function of a form field.</p>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"

<p><strong>Examples of clear and descriptive headings: </strong>A
website for a newspaper lists today’s headlines. Each headline is a

<li><strong>Housing Prices Plunge 5% Since August<br />

Criterion 2.4.7</strong> Focus Visible</h3>
<p>Level AA</p>
<p>Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where
the keyboard focus indicator is visible.</p>
</section>
<h4>Focus Visible Explained</h4>
<p>Keyboard focus is the one point within a window that receives
information from the keyboard. Only one component can have focus at a
time. When keyboard-only users press keystrokes, typically the Tab key,
to navigate around a web page, they are moving focus from one component
to another.</p>
<p>Whether it’s people with low vision who rely on a keyboard to
interact with web pages or power users who use a keyboard to navigate
more efficiently, each must know which component has focus. By complying
with <strong>SC 2.4.7</strong>, keyboard users can tell at a glance
exactly what they are interacting with on a web page.</p>
<p>By default, browsers display focus indicators when navigating by
keyboard. If they are not present, they have been purposely removed. For
the most part, these indicators appear as faint rectangles that surround
the focused component. In text fields, the focus indicator is usually a
flashing cursor. Web authors who use CSS and JavaScript can enhance the
appearance of focused components or make them invisible or hard to see.
Authors often remove the focus visibility for aesthetic reasons, though
that practice violates this success criteria. WCAG 2.1 requires web
authors to ensure that all focused components are easy to spot when
navigating by keyboard.</p>
<p>While the default focus indicator is sufficient to pass the
requirements of this success criteria, they can still be difficult to
see, even for those with relatively good sight. It is generally
recommended that website developers enhance the default focus indicator
to make it easier for everyone to see.</p>

<h4><strong><span></span>Try This: Focus Indicators</strong></h4>
<p>To see what focus looks like, open the <a
href="https://de.ryerson.ca/wa/showcase">Accessibility Auditing
Showcase</a> website linked here, then press the Tab key repeatedly to
navigate through the page (put your mouse away). You do not need to use
ChromeVox for this activity. Answer the following questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you able to follow the focus easily as it moves through the
page?</li>
<li>Turn away, press the Tab key a few times, then look back. Can you
tell where the focus ended up?</li>
<li>Do all elements that receive focus have a focus indicator?</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, try the activity on a site that does not provide focus
highlighting:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.praxar.com">Praxar</a></p>
<p>Now, go to a few of the sites you are familiar with, and find a
couple with good focus indicators (default focus is okay), and find a
couple where the focus indicator is missing or partially missing (e.g.,
missing from links but present for form elements).</p>

<h4>Location Explained</h4>
<p>When a website or a web application consists of dozens, hundreds, or
thousands of pages, it can be easy to become disoriented and tricky to
find related information. To help visitors orient themselves, include
information about the current location in relation to the whole. This
can be done, for example, by:</p>
<ol>
<li>highlighting the current page within a set of navigation links,</li>
<li>providing a breadcrumb trail, or</li>
<li>describing the relationship of a page to a larger collection of
pages.</li>
</ol>
<p>This requirement may also be met by including a sitemap. Although
this involves navigating away from the current page, a site map is a
good way to show how information on one page (or in one part of the
site) relates to the whole.</p>

to users in general</a>.</p>
</section>
<h4>Link Purpose (Link Only) Explained</h4>
<p>Help visitors understand the purpose of each link. This is a more
stringent version of <strong>SC 2.4.4</strong>, which requires that
links make sense on their own, without the benefit of surrounding
context to add meaning. This benefits screen reader users who use a
feature to extract all links from a page and sort them as an
alphabetical list. When each link is unambiguous, individuals who rely
on this technique can confidently decide whether they want to follow a
link. They may otherwise hear a list of meaningless “Click Here”
links.</p>
<p>Some visitors may find pages that consist entirely of unambiguous
links easier to access, while others may find them harder to access. The
word “mechanism” gives web authors the option to make all links
understandable out of context or to provide a way to make them this way.
Providing this option gives all visitors the ability to customize the
“wordiness” of links to match their needs.</p>
<p>There is an exception to <strong>SC 2.4.9</strong> when the purpose
of a link cannot be determined from information that appears anywhere on
the web page. In this case, a person with the disability is not
disadvantaged, as the context is not available to anyone.</p>

Criterion 2.4.10</strong> Section Headings</h3>
<p>Level AAA</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-section">Section</a>
headings are used to organize the content.</p>
</section>
<h4>Section Headings Explained</h4>
<p>Whenever possible, divide pages into sections and begin each section
with the heading that reflects the place of the section within the
whole.</p>
<p>For example, a long document may be divided into chapters, chapters
into topics, topics into subtopics, and subtopics into paragraphs.
Headings are designed to organize content hierarchically; they are the
scaffolding that give shape to documents.</p>
<p>For HTML documents, use these elements to organize content
hierarchically:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;h1&gt; </code> <span style="font-size: 14pt">for the
highest level of page organization,</span></li>
<li><code>&lt;h2&gt; </code> <span style="font-size: 14pt">for the
second level,</span></li>
<li><code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> for the third level,</li>
<li>and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Word documents, use these styles to organize content
hierarchically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Heading 1</strong> for the highest level of page
organization,</li>
<li><strong>Heading 2</strong> for the second level,</li>
<li><strong>Heading 3</strong> for the third level,</li>
<li>and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Section headings clarify the organization of the content, facilitate
navigation, and aid comprehension. Other page elements, such as
horizontal rules and boxes, enhance the visual presentation but are not
sufficient in themselves to identify document sections.</p>
<p>This provision is included at Level AAA because headings may be
impractical or unsuitable. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headings are inappropriate for historical documents that do not have
headings. However, if the original document has a title, mark it up as
<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Headings are not normally used in letters, even when letters cover a
range of topics.</li>
<li>Some electronic file formats, such as plain text, have no built-in
support for hierarchically structured documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, see <strong>SC 1.3.1</strong> Info and Relationships (Level A).
While <strong>SC 2.4.10</strong> (Level AAA) suggests using headings to
section content by topic and subtopic within written content (as opposed
to interface elements), <strong>SC 1.3.1</strong> provides guidance on
organizing that content semantically so the relationships between topics
and subtopics can be understood. Content that complies with <strong>SC
1.3.1</strong>, also complies with <strong>SC 2.4.10</strong>, though
not necessarily vice versa.</p>

<h2><strong>Guideline 2.5</strong> Input Modalities</h2>
<p><strong><span
style="background-color: #00ff00;border: thin solid green;padding: 0.2em">WCAG
2.1</span></strong></p>
<p>Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various
inputs beyond keyboard.</p>
</section>
<p><strong>Why is it important to allow for multiple input
modes?</strong></p>
<p>A keyboard was the first input mode for accessing a computer. The
mouse was then introduced, greatly improving navigation through web
content — for those who could operate a mouse. Various other mouse-like
input devices soon followed, like track pads, track balls, eye-gaze
pointers, speech control, joysticks, and various other input methods
that mimic mouse functions.</p>
<p>Then, mobile devices with touch screens came along and introduced a
new range of input methods — these are typically referred to as
gestures. Gestures include physical movements like tapping, double
tapping, pressing and holding, swiping, dragging, and so on.</p>
<p>Needless to say, limiting input modes can greatly reduce the number
of people who are able to use a site. Fortunately, in many cases,
designing for both mouse and keyboard access will also allow other input
modes. A tap, for instance, is possible for elements that can be clicked
with a mouse. A swipe function is much like Tab key navigation. However,
it is when developers create custom elements in which mouse and/or
keyboard access are scripted that input modes may be limited.</p>

<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #3c3">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This requirement applies to web content that
interprets pointer actions (i.e., this does not apply to actions that
are required to operate the user agent or assistive technology).</p>
</div>
</section>
<h4>Pointer Gestures Explained</h4>
<p>With the introduction of smartphones and touch pads, multipoint
gestures have become fairly common place. A multipoint gesture typically
requires two or three fingers to perform the gesture. One example is a
pinch zoom, placing two fingers on a device screen and spreading them
apart, causing the screen to magnify. Some people will not be able to
perform such a gesture, so some other means is needed to zoom, such as
[-] or [+] buttons that zoom with a single tap or click. Single-point
gestures will be more accessible to some and can often be mimicked with
a keypress.</p>
<p>These are some examples of multipoint and single-point gestures:</p>
<p>Multipoint gestures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-finger pinch</li>
<li>Split tap</li>
<li>Two- or three-finger taps and swipes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Single-point gestures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tap</li>
<li>Double tap</li>
<li>Press and hold</li>
<li>Focus and gaze (eye tracking)</li>
</ul>
<p>Another type of gesture is a path gesture. In the case of a path
gesture, users draw a pattern to unlock a screen, or they drag a slider
thumb to select a value along a particular range. In both cases, some
people will not be able to click-and-drag or point-and-drag, so an
alternative will be required. For a slider, users should be able to
click on any spot along the slider, and, with a single click, they move
the slider thumb to a select position along the slider bar. Users should
also be able to control the slider thumb using a keyboard, though this
is covered by <strong>SC 1.3.1</strong> Keyboard (Level A).</p>
<p>Swipe gestures can also be difficult for some people. For example, a
photo gallery may use a swipe to navigate from one image to the next.
Next and Previous buttons or links can be added to the gallery viewer so
those who are unable to swipe can click. Next and Previous buttons, with
some scripting, can also be associated with left and right arrows on the
keyboard, so those unable to swipe or point and click can also operate
the gallery with a keypress.</p>
<p>This success criterion applies to web content rather than operating
system–level gestures. For example, Android phones may have users draw a
pattern to unlock the phone. In this case a preference setting is
available to switch to a code or to use a fingerprint scanner instead of
drawing the pattern. In this case, an operating system–level path
gesture can be replaced with a single point method of unlocking the
phone.</p>

</div>
</section>
<h4>Pointer Cancellation Explained</h4>
<p>The aim of this success criterion is to prevent accidental pointer
input, whether through a mouse click or through a touch gesture to
activate web content. For instance, by default, activation of a link or
button occurs when a click is released or when a finger is lifted. In
both cases, it gives a user an opportunity to abort the click or press
by moving the pointer away from the element that was clicked before
releasing it.</p>
<p>In most cases, activation should not occur during the down action
(e.g., mousedown, touchstart); rather, it should occur when the action
is released (e.g., mouseup, touchend). One exception occurs in cases
where a down-event pops open a dialog, which closes when the up event
occurs. Drag-and-drop elements also activate on the down action, i.e.,
holding down the element while it is moved. Then, the up action occurs
when the element is in its new location. In this case, users should be
able to release the action outside the allowable drop zone to abort,
which returns the element to its initial location.</p>
<p>There are other conventional behaviours that also rely on a
down-event, such as typing letters into a form field or clicking a key
on a piano app. In such cases, it would be counter-intuitive to have the
action occur on the up-event.</p>

</section>
<h4>Label in Name Explained</h4>
<p>This success criterion ensures that people who are using speech input
or text-to-speech output are able to draw a connection between what they
see on the screen and what their assistive technology reads to them.
Assistive technologies read the “accessible name” associated with
interface elements, which can be assembled with text gathered from a
number of sources, such as a role (e.g., menuitem), state (e.g.,
enabled), and properties (e.g., haspopup menu) associated with the
element, in addition to the text displayed on the screen. The W3C
defines “accessible name” as follows:</p>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="definition">
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accessible Name:</strong> The accessible name is the name of
a user interface element. Each platform <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#dfn-accessibility-api">accessibility
API</a> provides the accessible name property. The value of the
accessible name may be derived from a visible (e.g., the visible text on
a button) or invisible (e.g., the text alternative that describes an
icon) property of the user interface element. See related <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#dfn-accessible-description">accessible
description</a>.</p>
<p>A simple use for the accessible name property may be illustrated by
an “OK” button. The text “OK” is the accessible name. When the button
receives focus, assistive technologies may concatenate the platform’s
role description with the accessible name. For example, a screen reader
may speak “push-button OK” or “OK button.” The order of concatenation
and specifics of the role description (e.g., “button”, “push-button”,
“clickable button”) are determined by platform <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#dfn-accessibility-api">accessibility
APIs</a> or <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#dfn-assistive-technology">assistive
technologies</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>For those using speech input through voice recognition software, they
may encounter a form button created using an image, and in that image is
the word “search.” They can speak the word “search” to activate the
button but only if the alt text for the image is the same as the text in
the button image. In this case, alt is the accessible name, joined with
the role “button.”</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> By default, screen readers will read the
longer of either the text of an element (or alt text, as in the case
above) or the text of the title attribute. As result, any text content
associated with an element should be included in the title text if it is
being used.</p>
</div>
<p>On the other hand, a developer might also include additional
information in a title attribute for the button, with words such as
“enter keywords or phrases.” This text is hidden by default but displays
when a mouse pointer hovers over the button. For a speech input user,
they see the word “search” in the image, though in this case the
accessible text would be “enter keywords and phrases.”</p>
<p>As a result of the accessible name differing from the text label for
the button, a speech user may be unable to activate the button, in which
the visible button text (“search”) and the accessible name (“enter
keywords or phrases”) differ. In this case, the text in the button image
should be prefixed on the title text. So you end up with an accessible
name like “search: enter keywords and phrases.” In this case, the user
can speak the word “search” to send focus to the button via its title
text.</p>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="example">
<p>In the markup for this button, the text associated with the image
would appear as follows:</p>
<div title="example">
<pre><code>&lt;button title=&quot;Search: enter keywords or phrases&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;search_icon.png&quot; alt=&quot;Search&quot;&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Common screen readers handle title text
in different ways. In the current version of JAWS (version 18, at the
time of this book’s release), title text is no longer read. In the past,
JAWS would read the longer of the link text or title text as the default
setting. Users could also set JAWS to read the title text, the link
text, or the longer of the two, through a preference setting. By
default, it now reads the link text, and despite the option available to
read the title text or the longer, these settings no longer function in
the current version of JAWS.</p>
<p>NVDA, on the other hand, reads both the link text and the title text
by default. ChromeVox reads link text but does not read title text on
links.</p>
<p>As a result of this inconsistent support for the title attribute, do
not use title text on links if it contains critical information. Except
for NVDA, it will not be read by screen readers.</p>

that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be
operated by <a

prevent accidental actuation, except when:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supported Interface</strong>: The motion is used to operate

<li><strong>Essential</strong>: The motion is <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential">essential</a> for the
function and doing so would invalidate the activity.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>Motion Actuation Explained</h4>
<p>Most smartphones today include sensors, such as an accelerometer
and/or gyroscope, that detect motion of the device. For example, they
would detect shaking, which might act as an undo function. Some phones
can also detect user gestures through the device’s camera, such as a
hand wave to turn the page of an electronic book for instance.</p>
<p>Some people, however, who are unable to move the device (e.g., if it
is attached to a wheelchair) or are unable to produce gestures (e.g.,
are unable to use their hands), will need alternative means of
activating these functions. In the case of the undo function, there may
be a button alternative that can be pressed when the device is
stationary. Or, in the case of an electronic book, speech might be used
to turn the page, to tap on the right side of the screen, to swipe left,
and so on.</p>
<p>Likewise, motion actuation needs to be an option that can be
disabled. If, for instance, a user has a shaky hand, they may
inadvertently activate motion-based functions. They may need to disable
motion activation. For any function that is activated via motion, an
alternative means of activating the function is required that does not
require moving the device or gesturing to it.</p>

</ul>
</section>
<h4>Target Size Explained</h4>
<p>This success criterion was added in WCAG 2.1 to ensure that people
are able to activate actions either with a mouse click or a touch. Some
people may have difficulty targeting small objects with a mouse pointer,
perhaps having difficulty holding the mouse pointer steady enough to
click a tiny target area.</p>
<p>One common way to make tiny web elements, such as radio buttons or
checkboxes, targetable, is to label them with the HTML label element.
When it is used the label itself becomes clickable, creating a larger
target area to activate these tiny form elements.</p>
<p>Where target sizes often become problematic is in responsive designs.
When web content is viewed on larger screens, target areas may meet the
44 by 44 pixel minimum dimensions, though when viewed on a small device,
content may reflow and elements may be reduced in size to fit in the
smaller space available. On mobile devices, targets need to be (a) large
enough to be touchable with a finger tip without activating other nearby
elements unintentionally, and (b) large enough so a finger tip does not
completely obscure the element.</p>
<p>Exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Targets within a sentence</li>
<li>When target size is essential and would invalidate an activity or
function otherwise</li>
<li>When an equivalent 44 by 44 target is provided, the original does
not need to meet this requirement</li>
<li>Links at the end of a sentence to a footnote (these are considered
to be part of the sentence)</li>
<li>Elements that are part of the operating system user interface or a
user agent (e.g., browser)</li>

<p><span
style="background-color: #00ff00;border: thin solid green;padding: 0.2em">
<strong>WCAG 2.1</strong> </span></p>
<p>Level AAA</p>
<p>Web content does not restrict use of input modalities available on a
platform except where the restriction is <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential">essential</a>,
required to ensure the security of the content, or required to respect
user settings.</p>
</section>
<h4>Concurrent Input Mechanisms Explained</h4>
<p>This success criterion was added in WCAG 2.1 to ensure that users are
not limited in the input method they use to access web content. For a
mobile device, a finger tip is typically the main input method. For a
person who may have limited use of their fingers, however, they might
choose to attach a mouse and keyboard to their device to make it easier
to operate. Web content must not prevent the use of these or other
alternate input devices.</p>
<p>Input type restrictions typically occur when JavaScript is used to
handle input. If, for example, a developer chooses to use a
touch-specific event handler (e.g., touchstart) without providing
alternative access through a mouse event handler (e.g., mousedown), it
may make the content unusable by someone who is unable to touch a screen
or target elements on the screen. To avoid such limitation, developers
can create functions that handle a variety of input methods (e.g.,
finger, mouse, keyboard, stylus, or joystick), or they can use
device-independent event handlers (e.g. focus, blur, or click) that do
not rely on any specific input device.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Despite the “click” event being
associated with a mouse action, over time it has become a
device-independent event handler that works with any device (like how
focus and blur events behave).</p>

<div class="colorBox activity">
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/activity.png"
class="size-full wp-image-200 alignright" width="76" height="80" />There
are a variety of tools available on the Internet, as well as plugins or
add-ons for web browsers, that can be used to test the accessibility of
web content. But it is important to know that these tools differ in the
accuracy and coverage of what they test.</p>
<p>While automated accessibility checkers are a great way to get a quick
review of a website’s accessibility, they cannot be relied upon to
identify all potential barriers or even to identify them accurately.
Some barriers, particularly those that involve meaning in one way or
another, can’t be measured with automated checkers (at least, not with
the current state of the technology). Checkers are also not able to
determine whether some types of inaccessible content have accessible
alternatives.</p>
<h3>Activity</h3>
<p>In this activity, you will look at two popular automated
accessibility testing tools, AChecker and Wave, plus another one of your
choosing. You will describe what they are identifying and not
identifying as barriers. Some tools are quite clear about what they test
and list the checks they run. Other tools hide away the checks from the
end user, making it difficult to know exactly what is being tested. Some
have hundreds of checks they run. Others have just a handful. Some
checkers are customizable to the needs of each user; others have little
or no customization. The bottom line is accessibility checkers are not
created equal.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<strong>Key Point:</strong> Do not confuse checks with guidelines or
success criteria. Checks are typically more granular. Take SC 1.1.1.
Checkers can check for the presence of the string “alt” when it finds an
HTML image element. Another check looks for a value for alt, and another
the length of that value. Another check looks for the presence of a
title attribute, or perhaps an aria-describedby attribute. All of these
checks, and others, are related to this particular success criteria. A
success criteria may have a dozen or more checks associated with it.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Using the homepage from the two test sites listed above (i.e.,
Showcase and Lulu’s), compare the reports generated by AChecker, Wave,
and an accessibility checker of your choice (being sure to name it).</p>
<p>Answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How many known accessibility issues does each checker identify on
each of the test sites’ homepages?</li>
<li>Comparing each report, what did each checker miss that one of the
others may have caught? Provide specific examples.</li>
<li>How many manual checks did each checker suggest? (Manual checks
would be checks a human needs to make.)</li>
<li>Were there any false positives? (Examples of false positives
include: identifying barriers that are not barriers or identifying
barriers that have an accessible alternative available.)</li>
<li>Does the checker list the checks it runs? (This may take a little
research or digging around the settings or options of the application.
Also, see the note above that describes what a check is, as opposed to a
guideline or success criteria.)</li>
<li>Based on your experience here with the three checkers, what are your
overall thoughts on their accuracy and coverage?</li>
</ol>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<strong>Key Point:</strong> Do not assume the reports generated by the
checkers are accurate when comparing them in <strong>Question 2</strong>
above. Confirm for yourself that the items you selected for this
question are being accurately
reported.<em><strong>Warning:</strong></em> This might involve looking
at HTML.

<h2><strong>Principle 3</strong> Understandable</h2>
<p>Information and the operation of user interface must be
understandable.</p>
</section>
<h3>The Principle Explained</h3>
<p>If you have ever poked around an attractive-looking website written
in a language you do not recognize, you know that it is possible to
explore a site without understanding a single word.</p>
<p><strong>Principle 3</strong> builds on the principles that come
before it. Conforming to <strong>Principle 1</strong> ensures that users
can perceive a site. Conforming to <strong>Principle 2</strong> ensures
that users can act upon a site. But, even if visitors can see and
interact with content, a site is not fully accessible if users cannot
make sense of it. <strong>Principle 3</strong> is about increasing the
odds that visitors actually understand the content.</p>
<p>Even if content is written in your own language, it does not make the
content understandable. For example, a page may contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unfamiliar words or abbreviations</li>
<li>Overly complex instructions</li>
<li>Messages that tell you that you made a mistake, but fail to explain
how to fix it</li>
<li>Interactive components that look familiar but behave in
unpredictable ways</li>
</ul>
<p>Barriers to understanding content are felt acutely by users with
disabilities. Take, for example, the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>A student with low-vision uses magnification software. She needs to
enlarge text so much that only a few words fit on the screen at one
time. The lack of context makes it harder for her to understand
abbreviations. Does “PC” mean personal computer, police constable,
politically correct, or privy council?</li>
<li>A professor with a learning disability is an expert in his field. He
is very familiar with the jargon of the field, but he has trouble making
sense of long and — from his perspective — unnecessarily complex
sentences.</li>
<li>An online job-application form indicates required fields in colour.
Because screen readers only read text, an applicant who is blind is not
able to determine which fields are required and which are optional.</li>
</ul>
<p>By following <strong>Principle 3</strong> guidelines, visitors will
be better able to understand the content. <strong>Principle 3</strong>
is organized around three ideas. For web content to be understandable,
these three items must be followed:</p>
<ol>
<li>People must be able to read it: The content is
<strong>readable</strong>.</li>
<li>The site must behave in ways that people can predict: The content is
<strong>predictable</strong>.</li>
<li>The site must be designed to help people avoid mistakes. When they
do make mistakes, it should be forgiving of errors. In the language of
WCAG 2.1, the site provides <strong>input assistance</strong>.</li>

<h2><strong>Guideline 3.1</strong> Readable</h2>
<p>Make text content readable and understandable.</p>
</section>
<p><strong>What makes content ”readable?”</strong></p>
<p>“Readable” means content can be understood by an educated person,
with or without assistive technologies. Also, additional information
necessary to understand the content is made available.</p>
<p>The easiest “readability” provision to implement is specifying the
language (or languages) that appear on a web page. Language is specified
in the page markup and is invisible to readers. Nevertheless, encoding
the language — or changes in language — is important. Some browsers and
assistive technologies cannot present content correctly unless the web
author identifies the language or languages.</p>

<h4>Language of Page Explained</h4>
<p>Different languages use different alphabets. English, French, and
German use the Latin alphabet; Russian and Ukrainian, the Cyrillic
alphabet; and Greek, the Greek alphabet. Even when two languages share
an alphabet, they may not use the same letters. For example, both
English and Slovak are based on the Latin alphabet; however, English has
26 letters, while Slovak has 46.</p>
<p>Although <strong>SC 3.1.1</strong> mostly affects individuals who are
involved with the technical side of web production, anyone who creates
online content should be aware of the rule: <strong>every web page must
specify the language in which it is written</strong> (e.g., English,
French, Hebrew, Japanese, and so on). When this rule is followed,
browsers, media players, and assistive technologies automatically
present text properly.</p>
<p>Specifying the language ensures the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The correct alphabet is displayed</li>
<li>All letters, characters, and symbols for the specified language are
displayed</li>
<li>Screen readers load the appropriate pronunciation rules</li>
<li>Media players show the right captions</li>
</ul>
<p>When a web page uses several languages, specify the language that is
used most. If several languages share the spotlight, choose the
<em>first</em> language that appears on the page.</p>
<p>The language of a page is defined in the opening <code>html</code>
element on the page. The <code>html</code> element should have the
<code>lang</code> attribute added, with the appropriate language code as
its value. The two-letter language codes for HTML are defined in the ISO
639-1 standard, which are applied as seen in the following markup.</p>

Criterion 3.1.2</strong> Language of Parts</h3>
<p>Level AA</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-human-language-s">human
language</a> of each passage or phrase in the content can be <a
href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-programmatically-determinable">programmatically
determined</a>, except for proper names, technical terms, words of
indeterminate language, and words or phrases that have become part of
the vernacular of the immediately surrounding text.</p>
</section>
<h4>Language of Parts Explained</h4>
<p><strong>SC 3.1.1</strong> requires you to specify the language of
each page. Some pages, however, are written mostly in one language and
contain words or phrases in a second language. In these cases,
<strong>SC3.1.2</strong> requires you to specify the language of those
words and phrases. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>In an English-language novel, a character always speaks
French:<br />
<strong>“</strong>Where were you Tuesday evening?” he
asked.<strong><br />
<span lang="fr">“</span><span lang="fr">Je ne comprends
pas</span>,</strong>” she responded<strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A web page includes links to translations of the same page:<br />
This recipe is also available in <strong><span
lang="fr">français</span>, <span lang="de">Deutsch</span>,</strong> and
<strong>中文</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem">.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>By following <strong>SC3.1.2</strong>, browsers display the
appropriate alphabet for these passages, and screen readers pronounce
them correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions: </strong>There is no need to specify language
changes for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Proper names such as <strong>Sophia Loren</strong>, <strong>Olof
Palme</strong>, and <strong>Yma Sumac</strong>.</li>
<li>Technical terms such as <strong>Homo sapien, Alpha
Centauri,</strong> and <strong>habeas corpus</strong>.</li>
<li>Words or phrases that have become part of another language, such as
words that English has borrowed from French: <strong>rendezvous, RSVP,
laissez-faire</strong>, and so on.</li>
<li>Words or phrases where the language cannot be determined.</li>
</ol>
<p>Similar to how language of a page is defined by adding the
<code>lang</code> attribute to the opening tag, the language of parts is
defined by adding the <code>lang</code> attribute to the HTML element
containing language that is not the primary language of the page. In the
example below, the French language embedded in otherwise English text is
defined as French by adding <code>lang="fr"</code> to a tag enclosing
the French text.</p>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="example">
<p>Defining language of parts by adding the <code>lang</code> attribute
to HTML elements containing language other than the language of the
page, like the following:</p>
<div title="example">
<pre><code>&lt;span lang=&quot;fr&quot;&gt;Je ne comprends pas&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Of the screen readers you have been
introduced to so far, only JAWS supports language of parts. It will read
French, for instance, with French pronunciation in an otherwise English
web page. NVDA and ChromeVox will read French with English
pronunciation.</p>
</div>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Though there is significant variation in
support for accessibility standards across the common screen readers
(and browsers), developers should still implement accessibility features
as they are described in the standards (e.g., WCAG). Implementation in
assistive technologies often occur when there is sufficient adoption of
standards. For example, language of parts is more likely to be supported
in assistive technologies if the HTML <code>lang</code> attribute is
being broadly used in web content where changes in language occur.</p>

</section>
<h4>Unusual Words Explained</h4>
<p>“Unusual words” are words or phrases that readers are unlikely to
understand from context alone. This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Idioms</strong>: Phrases whose meaning cannot be inferred
from the meaning of the individual words that make up the phrase, such
as <strong>spill the beans, turn the tables</strong>, and <strong>eat
crow</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Jargon</strong>: Specialized terms used by people in
particular fields, such as <strong>charm</strong> (physics),
<strong>bug</strong> (computer programming), and <strong>ideological
hegemony</strong> (cultural studies).</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many ways to meet <strong>SC 3.1.3</strong>. For
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the first occurrence of each unusual word with its
definition</li>
<li>Use definition lists</li>
<li>Make a glossary that includes unusual words</li>
<li>Link unusual words to definitions at the bottom of the page</li>
</ul>
<p>Content that meets <strong>SC 3.1.3</strong> benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-specialists who need to understand specialized information</li>
<li>Students who are learning about a new or unfamiliar subject</li>
<li>Second-language learners</li>
<li>People whose disabilities make it difficult to understand idioms and
jargon</li>
<li>People who use screen magnification software — enlarging the text
can cause a loss of context</li>
<li>People who use handheld web devices with small screens — a small
screen may cause loss of context</li>

is available.</p>
</section>
<h3>Abbreviations Explained</h3>
<p>Abbreviations and acronyms are convenient for people who know them
but confusing for people who don’t.</p>
<ul>
<li>Abbreviations may have no obvious connection to the words they
represent. Switzerland is abbreviated as “CH,” which is Latin for
“Confoederatio Helvetica.”</li>
<li>Some abbreviations cannot be pronounced according to the rules of
the language. “DK” (for Denmark) and “rm” (for room) are not English
words or phonemes. Readers must know “or be able to guess” the
abbreviations to pronounce them correctly.</li>
<li>An acronym and a word may have the same spelling but different
meanings. For example, “RIP” is an acronym for “rest in peace” and is a
word meaning “slash.”</li>
<li>Some acronyms sound like common words but are spelled differently.
The acronym for Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language is SMIL and
is pronounced “smile.”</li>
<li>Some acronyms are pronounced differently than they appear. The
acronym for American Automobile Association is “AAA” and is sometimes
pronounced “triple A.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of ways to reduce the confusion that abbreviations may
cause:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide the expansion or explanation after the first occurrence of
the abbreviation</li>
<li>Link to its definition</li>
<li>Provide definitions using the html <strong>abbr</strong> and
<strong>acronym</strong> elements</li>
<li>Include a glossary</li>
<li>Link to a glossary</li>
<li>Provide a function to search an online dictionary</li>
</ul>
<p>Content that meets <strong>SC 3.1.4</strong> benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-specialists who are not familiar with abbreviations and acronyms
that specialists use</li>
<li>People who are encountering abbreviations and acronyms for the first
time</li>
<li>Second-language learners</li>
<li>People who have difficulties remembering</li>
<li>People who rely on screen magnification software (enlarging the text
can cause a loss of context)</li>

<h4>Reading Level Explained</h4>
<p>Clear and simple writing benefits everybody. There are people with
reading disabilities (e.g., dyslexia) who are highly educated and
possess specialized knowledge. It may be possible to accommodate some of
these individuals by making text more readable.</p>
<p>Ways to make text more readable include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplify the writing. For example, express one idea in each
paragraph, replace long or unfamiliar words with more common ones, and
use the active voice.</li>
<li>Provide a text summary that requires less advanced reading
ability.</li>
<li>Illustrate complex ideas with drawings, photographs, maps, symbols,
and other resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SC 3.1.5</strong> acknowledges that difficult and complex
writing is appropriate for certain audiences. The comprehensibility of
these texts can be improved by adding content that aids understanding,
such as a summary or a chart.</p>

<h2><strong>Guideline 3.2</strong> Predictable</h2>
<p>Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.</p>
</section>
<p><strong>What does “predictability” have to do with being
understandable?</strong></p>
<p>When reading web pages, people are not only seeing words, they are
also “reading” patterns, such as the layout and organization of the
page, the position and order of links, and the colour and shape of
headers. These patterns orient readers to what information is where, and
they help users focus in on the desired content.</p>
<p>Consistent patterns help readers understand content. Unpredictable
patterns increase the cognitive effort that readers need to make sense
of information.</p>
<p>Presenting information in a predictable order across a site is good
design. It simplifies access for all users, and it may make a crucial
difference for people with visual, learning, and cognitive disabilities,
who may become disoriented when information or controls appear in
different places on different pages.</p>

<p>Level A</p>
<p>When any <a

href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-change-of-context">change of
context</a>.</p>
</section>
<h4>On Focus Explained</h4>
<p>When designing a web page, do not confuse users by unexpectedly
changing the context when they navigate or explore.</p>
<p>Examples of context changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening a new window</li>
<li>Moving focus to another component</li>
<li>Going to a new page</li>
<li>Significantly rearranging the content of a page</li>
</ul>
<p>Conforming to <strong>SC 3.2.1</strong> minimizes the chance that
users will become confused or disoriented when interacting with a web
page:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the Tab key, which is normally used to jump from one
control to another, should <em>not</em> initiate a search</li>
<li>Pressing the down arrow key while scrolling through a drop-down menu

href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-change-of-context">change of

using the component.</p>
</section>
<h4>On Input Explained</h4>
<p>When designing online forms, ensure that (a) entering data in a text
field, (b) checking or unchecking a checkbox, or (c) selecting or
deselecting a radio button does not unexpectedly change the context.</p>
<p>Again, examples of context changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening a new window</li>
<li>Moving focus to another component</li>
<li>Going to a new page</li>
<li>Significantly rearranging the content of a page</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SC 3.2.2</strong> helps ensure that users can predict what
will happen when interacting with form controls. Context changes may
confuse users who cannot easily perceive the page or who are distracted
by the changes. A context change is appropriate only when the user is
notified that the change will happen in response to an action.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: A form contains three fields for entering
telephone numbers. The first field contains the three-digit area code.
The second field contains the first three digits. The third field
contains the last four digits. When a user completes entry of the first
field, focus automatically moves to the second field. This is a context
change. If this behaviour is described at the beginning of the form, the
page conforms to <strong>SC 3.2.2</strong>. If the behaviour is not
described, it does not conform.</p>

</section>
<h4>Consistent Navigation Explained</h4>
<p>When designing a website, keep information that is repeated on every
page in the same order.</p>
<p>Content is easier to find when the location of repeated information
is predictable. The phrase “same order” does <em>not</em> imply that
expanding and contracting navigation menus must be avoided. By adding or
removing links between existing navigation links, navigation within a
subsection is enabled, and the relative order is maintained.</p>
<p>Conforming to <strong>SC 3.2.3</strong> helps users predict the
location of the content they are looking for and find content more
quickly when they encounter it again. Consistencies in site layout are
especially helpful to individuals who rely on visual cues or their
spatial memory. People with low vision who use screen magnification
software consequently see only a small portion of the screen at one
time. These users can take advantage of page boundaries and other cues
to quickly locate repeated content.</p>
<p>Using templates to ensure consistency across a site helps web authors
meet <strong>SC 3.2.3</strong>.</p>

</section>
<h4>Consistent Identification Explained</h4>
<p>When designing a website, be consistent when identifying elements
that have the same function. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A newspaper publishes an online edition. Each article spans several
web pages. There are four links at the bottom of every page of every
article: First Page, Previous Page, Next Page, and Last Page.</li>
<li>On a company website, an envelope icon indicates that visitors can
send a message to an employee. The text alternative always begins with
the phrase “Send a message to” followed by the employee’s name.</li>
<li>On an e-commerce site, there are captions under photographs of
products. The caption gives the type of product followed by a short
description, e.g., “CD – John Denver’s Greatest Hits,” “Book – Emily
Martin – Woman in the Body: A Cultural Analysis of Reproduction.”</li>
<li>A website has a “Search” feature on some pages and a “Find” feature

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-change-of-context">Changes
of context</a> are initiated only by user request or a <a

</section>
<h4>Change on Request Explained</h4>
<p>When designing a website, give users control over context changes,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically advancing slide shows</li>
<li>Launching new windows</li>
<li>Spawning popup windows</li>
<li>Changing keyboard focus</li>
<li>Automatically submitting forms after selecting a list item</li>
</ul>
<p>In giving users this control, provide an option to disable context
changes.</p>
<p><strong>SC 3.2.5</strong> aims to eliminate confusion caused by
unexpected context changes. Unexpected context changes may complicate
access for people with motor impairments, people with low vision, people
who are blind, and people with certain cognitive disabilities.</p>
<p>Some context changes are not disruptive to everybody or benefit only
certain people. For example, context changes are an integral part of
slide shows that automatically advance. Content that automatically
changes context conforms to <strong>SC 3.2.5</strong>, but users
must have the option to turn the feature on or off.</p>
<p>Other examples of conformance to <strong>SC 3.2.5</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of automatically updating the order form on an e-commerce
site, users activate an “Update Now” button to refresh the content.</li>
<li>A user is automatically redirected from an old page to a new page in
a way that he or she never realizes the redirect has occurred.</li>

<h2><strong>Guideline 3.3</strong> Input Assistance</h2>
<p>Help users avoid and correct mistakes.</p>
</section>
<p><strong>What is “input assistance?” How does it support
understandability?</strong></p>
<p>“Input assistance” is WCAG 2.1 jargon for techniques that help people
avoid mistakes, especially when filling out forms. When people do make
mistakes, it refers to the techniques that help them recover from
errors.</p>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="definition">
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p><strong>Input assistance:</strong> Techniques that encourage users to
understand the <em>process</em> of entering information. These
techniques include providing clear instructions, a chance to check work
before submitting it, and context-sensitive help.</p>
</div>
<p>Everyone makes mistakes, but some people with disabilities may be
more prone to input errors than people without disabilities. For
example, someone with a tremor may press keys by accident. An individual
who is blind may have trouble determining which fields are mandatory and
which are optional. A person who relies on speech recognition software
may produce words that are different than the dictated words.</p>
<p>This guideline seeks to reduce the number of serious errors that
users make, increase the likelihood that users will notice their errors,
and help users understand what they must do to correct errors.</p>

Criterion 3.3.1</strong> Error Identification</h3>
<p>Level A</p>
<p>If an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-input-error">input
error</a> is automatically detected, the item that is in error is
identified and the error is described to the user in text.</p>
</section>
<h4>Error Identification Explained</h4>
<p>When designing a website or online form, use text to indicate and
describe errors.</p>
<p>It is okay to signal errors with images and colour changes provided
there are also text descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A bank encourages customers to apply for
loans online. A customer submits a form with his or her name, address,
phone number, email address, and account number. If the customer does
not complete the form correctly, the form is re-displayed with an alert
— three question marks <strong>???</strong> displayed after the prompt —
for all missing or incorrect fields.</p>
<p>In addition, the fields in error are highlighted yellow to make them
easier to spot.</p>
<p><strong>SC 3.3.1</strong> is a special benefit to screen reader
users. Since screen readers only read text, screen reader users may have
trouble understanding non-text error messages.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-labels">Labels</a> or
instructions are provided when content requires user input.</p>
</section>
<h4>Labels or Instructions Explained</h4>
<p>When designing online forms, help users enter information by
providing clear instructions and examples. Conformance to
<strong>SC 3.3.2</strong> helps users avoid mistakes when their input is
required.</p>
<p>When filling out forms, people who use certain assistive technologies
are more likely to make mistakes than users without disabilities.
Similarly, when recovering from mistakes, these users may have trouble
focusing in on and fixing problems.</p>
<p>Instructions and cues that are visually and programmatically
connected to form controls help users complete forms successfully the
first time. If they do make mistakes, instructions and cues make it
easier to find and fix them.</p>
<p><strong>Examples of providing clear cues and
instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>Given Name</strong> instead of <strong>Name 1</strong>
as the prompt for entering a first name, and <strong>Family
Name</strong> instead of <strong>Name 2</strong> for entering a
surname.</li>
<li>Show the required date format for a field: <strong>Date
(dd-mm-yyyy)</strong>.</li>
<li>Place prompts for text fields and combo boxes above or to the left
of controls, and place prompts for checkboxes and radio buttons to the
right of controls. Doing this “automatically” produces fairly accessible
form controls.</li>

</section>
<h4>Error Suggestion Explained</h4>
<p>When designing online forms, provide suggestions for fixing problems
when input errors are detected.</p>
<p>This is a more stringent version of <strong>SC 3.3.1</strong>, which
requires that errors be identified. To conform to <strong>SC
3.3.3</strong>, the errors must not only be identified, but suggestions
on how to correct them must be provided.</p>
<p>Explaining how to correct input errors may help people who, due to
disability, have difficulties completing and submitting online forms.
This includes people with learning disabilities, cognitive disabilities,
visual impairments, and motor impairments.</p>
<p>For example, an input field asks users to type a month name. If a
user enters “12,” suggestions for correction may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of the acceptable values: <strong>Choose one of: January,
February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October,
November, December</strong>.</li>
<li>A reworded prompt: <strong>Type the month name.</strong></li>
<li>A conversion of the input data in an interactive popup window:
<strong>Do you mean “December?”</strong></li>

<li><strong>Confirmed</strong>: A mechanism is available for reviewing,

</ul>
</section>
<h4>Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data) Explained</h4>
<p>When designing websites that allow people to make financial
transactions, establish legal commitments, update data, or take tests,
you need to help users avoid serious consequences of their mistakes.</p>
<p>The aim of <strong>SC3.3.4</strong> is to give users a second chance
if they accidentally input the wrong information or activate the wrong
control. In the following examples, the mistakes involve transactions
that occur immediately and without the ability to alter them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing non-refundable and non-exchangeable airline tickets
online can have serious financial consequences. If a user specifies the
wrong travel date, they may wind up with a ticket they cannot use.</li>
<li>Accidentally deleting or modifying information stored in a travel
service database may have dire consequences if the person later needs to
access information about a flight.</li>
<li>While taking an online examination, accidentally clicking the
“Submit” button before answering all questions could result in a poor
score.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some people with disabilities are more likely to make mistakes than
people without disabilities. People with certain reading disabilities
may transpose numbers and letters. People with motor disabilities may
hit keys by accident.</p>
<p>To conform to <strong>SC 3.3.4</strong>, allow users to correct
mistakes that could result in serious consequences before they happen.
Provide one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>A mechanism to reverse actions</li>
<li>A way to review and correct information before it is submitted</li>
<li>A way to check data for input errors</li>

help</a> is available.</p>
</section>
<h4>Help Explained</h4>
<p>When designing online forms, provide context-sensitive help when
prompts cannot be made sufficiently descriptive.</p>
<p>By providing context-sensitive help, users can learn what to do
without losing track of where they are. Context-sensitive help is only
required when it is impractical to include full details in the prompts
and labels.</p>
<p>It might be appropriate to offer context-sensitive help on an
application for an employment program for newcomers to Canada.
Applicants are asked to list their college and university degrees.
Context-sensitive help reminds applicants that they are not obliged to
include the years that degrees were granted.</p>
<p>One way to provide context-sensitive help is to place “Help” links
next to questions.</p>
<p>Conforming to <strong>SC3.3.5</strong> helps:</p>
<ul>
<li>People with reading, writing, and intellectual disabilities</li>
<li>Seniors</li>
<li>Second-language learners</li>
<li>Anyone who has trouble completing forms</li>
<li>Anyone who does not know what information to include or exclude when

accident, he has little use of his hands. He operates a computer via
speech-recognition software instead of a keyboard and mouse. Recognition
is excellent but not perfect.</p>
<p>While signing up for an online science forum, Reginald dictates his
first name into the “Name” field. The speech recognition software thinks
he said “Register,” which causes the mouse to click the “Register”
button. Because the forum conforms to <strong>SC 3.3.6</strong>, the
system gives him a chance to add his name before it commits the
information to the database.</p>

any website intended for use by a <strong>general audience</strong><span
style="font-weight: 400">, the level of language used should not exceed
that which could be understood by a “lower-level high school” reader.
That is, language you might expect a grade 8 or 9 student, 12- to
15-years-old, to comprehend effectively on first reading. Some content
developers may consider reading level an optional requirement, given
WCAG 2.1, <strong>SC 3.1.5</strong> Reading Level is a Level AAA success
criterion. When writing for a general audience, however, it is always a
good idea to write using the simplest language possible as a way to
reach the broadest audience. Simpler, more readable language is
appreciated by even the most educated of readers. And for those with
cognitive- or reading-related disabilities, as well as those reading in
a second language, simple language is often required to ensure they
understand what is being said.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Principle 4:</strong> Robust</h2>
<p>Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by
a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</p>
</section>
<h3>The Principle Explained</h3>
<p>If you open the browser’s View Source feature while viewing a web
page, you will find a document that consists of all the words that
appear on the page (the content). Thickly interspersed with those words,
there are non-words, numbers, and symbols (the code). The code describes
how the content should be formatted and what purpose it serves.</p>
<p>During the process of creating a web page, errors tend to creep into
the code. In fact, mistakes are almost inevitable. These errors almost
always affect the appearance and functionality of the page. The effects
may be minor (the formatting is slightly off) or major (the page does
not display at all).</p>
<p><strong>Principle 4</strong> is about making websites
<em>robust</em>. A robust web page meets the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>It displays content as the author intends</li>
<li>It functions as the author intends</li>
<li>It is compatible with current and future browsers, web-enabled
devices, and assistive technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>Browsers, web-enabled devices, and assistive technologies do their
best to compensate for coding errors. But there are limits to what can
be repaired. To conform to <strong>Principle 4</strong>, web authors are
required to avoid specific kinds of coding errors.</p>

<h2><strong>Guideline 4.1</strong> Compatible</h2>
<p>Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including
assistive technologies.</p>
</section>
<p><strong>Why is compatibility important?</strong></p>
<p>The goal of <strong>Guideline 4.1</strong> is to ensure that web
pages display correctly and work as the author intends in the following
cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>All current and future browsers, web-enabled devices, and assistive
technologies</li>
<li>All current and future assistive technologies</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all users have up-to-date technologies. Compatible web pages also
work reasonably well in older and obsolete browsers, web-enabled
devices, and assistive technologies. Obviously, not all features
available on modern websites are compatible with older technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Guideline 4.1</strong> requires web authors to confirm the
following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that code does not “break” or otherwise impede assistive
technologies</li>
<li>Expose information in standard ways so that assistive technologies
can recognize and interact with content</li>
</ol>
<p>Web technologies change quickly, and assistive technology developers
are constantly playing catch-up. When web authors code according to
specification, they maximize the chances that assistive technologies
will work seamlessly with present and future technologies.</p>

Criterion 4.1.1</strong> Parsing</h3>
<p>Level A</p>
<p>In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete
start and end tags, elements are nested according to their
specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any
IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these
features.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #3c3">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Start and end tags that are missing a critical

<h4>Parsing Explained</h4>
<p>Ensure web pages conform to all markup language specifications.</p>
<p>Conforming to <strong>SC 4.1.1</strong> ensures that browsers,
web-enabled devices, and assistive technologies interpret, parse, and
display content accurately. Improper markup may cause content to display
differently in different browsers or devices, display incorrectly, not
display at all, or be inaccessible to assistive technologies.</p>
<p>An easy way to test <strong>SC 4.1.1</strong> is to use a validation
tool, such as the <a href="http://validator.w3.org">W3C Markup
Validation Service</a>. A good validator will detect incomplete start
and end tags, missing quotation marks, problems with attributes,
duplicate IDs, and more.</p>

<h4>Status Messages Explained</h4>
<p><strong>SC 4.1.3</strong> helps ensure that assistive technology
users, particularly people who are blind, receive feedback after
completing an action. For typical website visitors, feedback such as
confirmation, error, or warning messages are presented to them on the
screen, often updating the content of the page without reloading it.
They are usually visually recognizable. For screen reader users, this
dynamically added content will typically go unnoticed if it has not been
created in a way that screen readers are able to identify.</p>
<p>Fortunately, with the introduction of WAI-ARIA, providing feedback to
screen readers is relatively simple. It’s as uncomplicated as adding a
type of live region role that announces itself to a screen reader when
the content of the associated element changes. There are a number of
live region roles that can be added to feedback messages to ensure they
are announced, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>role="alert"</code></li>
<li><code>role="status"</code></li>
<li><code>role="log"</code></li>
</ul>
<p>After submitting a registration form, a feedback message may appear
on the page after it has been submitted. Having the content of the
feedback automatically read when the page loads ensures the screen
reader user gets the message and is not left wondering whether the
action just completed was successful or not. In this case, a status
message can be presented to the user, as in the following feedback
message:</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #0be">
<p><strong>Technical:</strong></p>
<div role="status">
<pre><code>&lt;div role=&quot;status&quot;&gt;
Thank you for submitting your registration. 
You will be contacted shortly.
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>An error message might be injected into a form next to a required
email field, after leaving the email field empty. The page does not
reload, but instead a highlighted message is inserted next to the email
field using JavaScript. The message reads automatically when it
appears.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #0be">

<p>An important and recent addition to the family of accessibility
standards created by the W3C is WAI-ARIA. This acronym stands for “Web
Accessibility Initiative,” the W3C subgroup that created the standard,
and “Accessible Rich Internet Applications,” the name of the standard
itself. Here we touch on WAI-ARIA without going into much detail. It is
primarily aimed at developers who create custom web applications and
widgets using non-standard HTML. For example, a developer might create a
checkbox out of an HTML <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>element. WAI-ARIA allows
a developer to assign checkbox semantics to that
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, like its role (i.e., <code
style="background-color: #ffffff">role="checkbox"</code>) and its state
(i.e., <code
style="background-color: #ffffff">aria-checked="true"</code> or <code
style="background-color: #ffffff">aria-checked="false"</code>), so when
it is encountered by an assistive technology, the technology recognizes
that <code>&lt;div&gt; </code>as a checkbox.</p>
<div>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd"
title="definition">
<p><strong>What is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code></strong>?</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag defines a division or a section in
an HTML document.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;div&gt; </code> element is often used as a container
for other HTML elements to style them with CSS or to perform certain
tasks with JavaScript.</p>

</div>
<p>You were indirectly introduced to some of the semantics described in
the paragraph above in Activity 1. As you were navigating through the
Showcase demo website, you would have heard a number of WAI-ARIA
elements announced by your screen reader.</p>
<p>As part of what you are learning here, just knowing of the existence
of WAI-ARIA will be sufficient. Here, we will provide an overview of how
it works and when it should be used, along with an example you can try
with your screen reader to develop a little practical experience with
it.</p>
<div
style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd;border-left: 10px solid #f66">
<strong>Key Point:</strong> Just be familiar with the existence of
WAI-ARIA and the purpose it serves as part of your learning here.
WAI-ARIA makes custom-created web elements meaningful to assistive
technology users.
</div>
<h2>Static vs. Dynamic WAI-ARIA</h2>
<p>Though primarily aimed at developers and programmers, there is some
WAI-ARIA that can be used in a static form. That is, a person writing
HTML can write WAI-ARIA  right into the HTML. The landmark navigation
elements you were introduced to earlier is one example of a static use
of HTML. These landmarks are a type of role, specifically used to define
regions on a web page. There are eight landmark roles, listed here.</p>
<h3>WAI-ARIA Landmark Roles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Banner</li>
<li>Navigation</li>
<li>Main</li>
<li>Complimentary</li>
<li>Contentinfo</li>
<li>Search</li>
<li>Form</li>
<li>Region</li>
</ul>
<p>Other roles can also be used statically, though it is generally
necessary to update their associated states and properties using
JavaScript. Let’s take the WAI-ARIA semantics for a menu as an example.
The main WAI-ARIA elements for defining menus are as follows:</p>
<h4>Roles</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>menubar</strong> (defines a role for a container, typically
a top level list, where multiple submenus are present)</li>
<li><strong>menu</strong> (the role assigned to each submenu)</li>
<li><strong>menuitem</strong> (the role assigned to each item in a
submenu)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Properties</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>aria-haspopup</strong> (assigned to menu items that are the
parent of a submenu that can be opened)</li>
<li><strong>aria-activedescendant</strong> (the ID value of the menu
item that is currently active)</li>
<li><strong>aria-describedby</strong> or
<strong>aria-labelledby</strong> (refers to the ID of an element
containing a description of the menu or instruction on how to operate
it)</li>
</ul>
<h4>States</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>aria-expanded</strong> (when a menu item’s submenu is open,
aria-expanded is set to “true”; otherwise, it should be set to
false)</li>
<li><strong>aria-hidden</strong> (set to true to hide inactive submenus;
set to false when a submenu is displayed)</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><span></span>Try This: Revisit the Showcase
Menu</strong></h4>
<p>Now that you’ve been introduced to some of the WAI-ARIA elements that
might be used with a menu, revisit the menu on the Showcase site
(reproduced below) <em><strong>using your screen reader</strong></em>.
Navigate through the first menu below using the Tab and arrow keys.
Listen carefully to what the screen reader is announcing. Then, do the
same for the second menu below. Are you able to pick out the difference?
Though they both operate exactly the same, only the first menu has
WAI-ARIA menu semantics added to it.</p>

</div>
</section>
<h2>When to Use WAI-ARIA</h2>
<p>It is important to understand when and when not to use WAI-ARIA. If
incorrectly used, it can create more problems than it resolves. Any
standard uses of HTML do not need WAI-ARIA. For example, an HTML
<code>&lt;form&gt;</code> does not need its role defined as a form
(i.e., <code>role="form"</code>). It already has this role defined by
default.</p>
<p>As described above, if a developer wanted to create a custom checkbox
using a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, in that case,
<code>role="checkbox"</code> would be added as an attribute of the
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Assistive technologies would then recognize
the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> as a checkbox. That said, however, when
there is an HTML element that serves a particular purpose, like a
checkbox, it is generally better to use the standard checkbox rather
than creating a custom one.</p>
<p>When navigating through the menu examples above, you may notice that
the list semantics of the second menu are suppressed in the first menu.
In this case, replacing the list semantics with menu semantics is
desired. On the other hand, if HTML headings were being used as headers
in a collapsible menu, adding the <code>role="menu"</code> attribute to
the heading would suppress the structural semantics associated with the
heading. This potentially upsets the structure of the document and
removes headings as a means of navigation.</p>

<div class="colorBox activity">
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/activity.png"
class="size-full wp-image-200 alignright" width="76" height="80" />One
of the main requirements under the robust principle is using web
technologies as they were intended to be used. Assistive technologies
rely on standard uses of HTML, for instance, to effectively read out
content on the Web. When HTML is used in non-standard ways, i.e., when
it is used incorrectly, it can often affect accessibility.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it can be difficult to find websites that actually use
valid HTML. More often than not, websites contain a range of markup
errors, which may or may not affect accessibility. In many cases, broken
HTML markup won’t cause problems. Browsers are pretty good at
dynamically correcting HTML. But there are difficult-to-predict errors
that sometimes interact with other errors in HTML markup, which prevent
assistive technologies from accessing parts of the content.</p>
<p>From the perspectives of search engines (a site’s ranking in search
results) and responsive design (a site’s ability to work effectively
across a range of browsers and operating systems), using valid HTML is
important for each of these reasons (i.e., the curb cut effect).</p>
<h2>Activity</h2>
<p>In this activity, you’ll review the validity of the HTML used on
three (3) websites that you are familiar with. It could be your own
site, your employer’s site, perhaps a site where you shop online, or
maybe your banking site (though not limited to these). Choose sites that
you use regularly or that you would expect others to use regularly and
examine the validity of the HTML used to create the site.</p>
<p>Choose only one page from each site. The homepage is a good
candidate, or choose another important page like a shopping cart page or
a registration/login page. Enter the URL to that page into the validator
at the link that follows:</p>
<p><a href="https://validator.w3.org">W3C HTML Validator</a></p>
<p>Some common issues to watch for that can affect accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML tags that are not closed</li>
<li>Duplicate ID attributes used on a given page</li>
<li>HTML used incorrectly (e.g., certain HTML tags used where they
should not be)</li>
<li>HTML elements that are not correctly nested (e.g., a parent element
closed before a child element is closed)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>In your answers for this activity include the following details for
each website:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the name and URL of the website?</li>
<li>How many errors did the validator find?</li>
<li>How many warnings did the validator find?</li>
<li>Scan through the validation report. Identify any markup errors (not
warnings) that you think might affect accessibility. List at least one,
but no more than three, if you find issues.</li>
<li>Describe <em>why</em> you think it might be an issue. If there are
none, mention “none.” (No wrong answers here, provided your reasoning is
logical.)</li>
<li>If there are any false positives in the report that the validator
generates, mention those or mention “none” if you don’t see any.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> Warnings generated by the validator
typically have no effect on accessibility. Although, in some cases, they
can affect other aspects of the site, like search engine rankings or
cross-browser compatibility.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> If the site you are validating uses HTML5
(as most do nowadays), the validator will default to using the NU HTML
Checker. This checker is still a work in progress, so there may be
issues identified that are not actual issues. If you encounter issues
that do not seem right, you can mention those in your false
positives.</p>

<p>The material here focuses on describing the accessibility
requirements of the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, also known
as WCAG 2.1. This latest version of the guidelines was released in late
2018, building on WCAG 2.0. It adds guidelines and success criteria for
accessibility as it relates to mobile devices, and includes additional
success criteria for making web content accessible to people with
cognitive disabilities.</p>
<h2>Unit 1: Why Learn About Web Accessibility</h2>
<p>Before getting into the details of WCAG, this first unit provides
background on why these guidelines are needed. You are introduced to the
idea of “<strong>curb cuts</strong>,” which are representative of
accommodations for people with disabilities that have come to improve
access and usability for more than just those with disabilities.
<strong>Business cases</strong> are also introduced, showcasing why
addressing accessibility is good for businesses in a variety of ways.
For those in Ontario and for those who want to know about how Ontario is
addressing accessibility for people with disabilities,
the<strong><em>Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act</em>
(AODA)</strong> is introduced, as well as <strong>accessibility laws
emerging around the world</strong>. Many of these base their web
accessibility requirements on WCAG. To round off the unit, you are
introduced to <strong>disabilities and the types of barriers</strong>
different groups encounter. In addition, you learn <strong>how to use a
screen reader</strong>, the primary technology used by people who are
blind to access computers and the Web.</p>
<h2>Unit 2: WCAG</h2>
<p>This unit introduces the parts of WCAG. The <strong>four guiding
principles</strong> state that web content must be:
<strong>perceivable</strong>, <strong>operable</strong>,
<strong>understandable</strong>, and <strong>robust</strong>. Next,
<strong>Levels of Accessibility</strong> help prioritize potential
accessibility issues based on their impact on people with disabilities,
with Level A being the most important. WCAG consists of
<strong>Guidelines</strong> and <strong>Success Criteria</strong>, which
describe the general requirements to meet those guidelines. Each success
criterion is accompanied by <strong>Sufficient and Advisory
Techniques</strong>, which are technology-specific strategies that can
be used to remove barriers or improve accessibility. The idea of
<strong>compliance</strong> is introduced, along with what is needed in
order to claim compliance. You also learn <strong>why the WCAG 2.1
update is needed</strong> and <strong>how WCAG is related to
AODA</strong> and other accessibility laws around the world.</p>
<h2>Unit 3: Perceivable</h2>
<p>The perceivable principle and its associated guidelines and success
criteria are covered in detail in this unit, which looks at each success
criterion from a practical perspective. In general, content needs to be
presented in a way that can be <strong>perceived through multiple
senses</strong>, so if a person is missing a sense (e.g., sight), they
are able to access content through other senses (e.g., hearing and
touch). Since people who are blind tend to face the most barriers in web
content, a significant focus is placed on providing <strong>alternatives
for visual content</strong>, like images and multimedia.</p>
<p>This principle also introduces the idea of <strong>adaptable
content</strong>. This is content which can be accessed in different
ways, not only through multiple senses but also through a variety of
devices and assistive technologies, using different learning strategies
or styles.</p>
<p>Being able to perceive content also means being able to
<strong>distinguish that content from the background</strong> in which
it appears. In the case of colour, foreground text needs to provide
sufficient <strong>contrast</strong> with its background in order to be
readable by those with low vision. Additionally, when <strong>colour is
used to represent meaning</strong>, that meaning must be communicated
through some means other than colour. In the case of audio, spoken
dialogue in multimedia needs to be sufficiently loud enough to be
<strong>distinguishable from background noise</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, in this unit, you have an opportunity to use
<strong>captioning tools</strong>, like <strong>Amara</strong> or
<strong>YouTube</strong>, to create captions and a transcript for a
short video.</p>
<h2>Unit 4: Operable</h2>
<p>Next to providing alternatives for visual and audio content, it is
critical that content, such as forms, links, interactive applications,
and widgets, be <strong>operable with both keyboard and mouse</strong>.
Since people who are blind typically cannot see a mouse cursor on the
screen, they will generally rely on a keyboard to navigate. Many others
rely on a keyboard to access content. Developers, often mouse users
themselves, may not be aware how critical keyboard accessibility is.</p>
<p>This unit also introduces you to <strong>keyboard traps</strong>,
which create problems for those who rely on a keyboard to access
content. These traps are created when navigating into an object, like a
Flash-based activity or an embedded content editor, then getting stuck
there. A trap may prevent access to any content that follows it.</p>
<p>Timing is also a potential barrier. People with disabilities often
take longer to complete tasks, so when timing is used, there needs to be
<strong>ways to either extend time or to disable it</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Flashing content</strong> is discussed, along with its
potential to initiate seizures and other physical reactions in people
with various <strong>photosensitive disorders</strong>. <strong>Moving
content</strong> can cause physical reactions similar to motion sickness
for people with vestibular disorders. Web content developers should
avoid content that flashes between 3 and 50 flashes per second. And,
where there is content that moves, developers should provide a way to
disable movement.</p>
<p>Part of being operable is the ability to navigate through web content
effectively. This involves providing <strong>consistent, logically
arranged,</strong> and <strong>conventional navigation features</strong>
throughout a website or application, so users only need to learn to
navigate once. Then they can use their past experience with that web
content to help make sense of navigation elements across websites.
Navigable also means being able to <strong>move through pages of content
in efficient ways</strong>, perhaps by using <strong>bypass links,
WAI-ARIA landmarks,</strong> and <strong>properly nested
headings</strong>. When these elements are missing, navigating through
complex content can be unnecessarily time-consuming for people who rely
on a keyboard.</p>
<p>With the introduction of smart mobile devices in 2007 with the first
iPhone, a new set of potential barriers was created. The first
smartphones typically relied on the ability to complete various
<strong>gestures,</strong> like <strong>tapping, pinch zooming,</strong>
and <strong>swiping</strong>, among other means of navigating and
operating smaller screens. For those with various types of mobility
disabilities, gestures can be difficult and sometimes impossible. WCAG
2.1 introduced one new guideline and a series of related success
criteria to provide guidance on developing for mobile devices in a way
that does not create barriers.</p>
<p>Finally, the activity in this unit introduced you to
<strong>automated accessibility checkers</strong>. While these checkers
are a good first pass to identify potential barriers, they
<strong>cannot be relied upon</strong> to identify all potential
accessibility problems. When evaluating accessibility, it is important
to include a variety of test strategies, including <strong>automated
checkers, manual tests,</strong> and <strong>human decision
making</strong>.</p>
<h2>Unit 5: Understandable</h2>
<p>One of the primary requirements under the understandable principle is
that content should be readable. <strong>Readable</strong> can mean
different things. First, the language of a page of web content needs to
be defined. This is done in the opening HTML of a web page by defining
the language in a <code>lang</code> attribute, using a standard language
code as its value (e.g., lang=”en”). Typically, assistive technologies
will <strong>default to pronouncing content with English
pronunciation</strong> if no language has been defined. It is
particularly important to define languages when other languages are
used, so the appropriate pronunciation is used by the assistive
technology. Otherwise, languages such as French, German, or Chinese will
sound strange (at best) or not be understandable at all (at worst). The
same is true for changes in the language of content, for example, having
French phrases in an otherwise English document. Those phrases in French
need their language defined, so assistive technologies will switch from
English to French, reading the French text with French pronunciation,
then continue to read in English.</p>
<p><strong>Abbreviations and acronyms</strong> can also be problematic,
not only for those using assistive technologies (which often try to
pronounce short forms) but also for readers who may not be familiar with
a short form. Providing the full text of an abbreviation or acronym will
be helpful for many people and may be necessary for those using
assistive technologies to comprehend it.</p>
<p><strong>Reading level</strong> is also discussed in this unit.
Typically, the content of a web page should be written at a level
appropriate for the audience. However, when the audience is the general
public, it should be written to be <strong>understandable by a
15-year-old</strong> (i.e., lower-level high school student). You were
introduced to a number of tools that can be used to measure the reading
level of text, including strategies that can be used to reduce reading
level, like reducing the length of sentences, using more common words,
and writing in the active voice.</p>
<p>An important element for comprehension is
<strong>predictability</strong>. This is related in part to convention,
discussed under the operability principle. Many features on the Web
function the same way, no matter where you might access them. An HTML
Select box, for example, functions the same way regardless of the
website it appears on or the browser/device used to display it. When
developers create custom elements that function differently than what
one might predict, confusion can often set in.</p>
<p><strong>Changes in context</strong> may also upset predictability.
These changes often occur when web content changes without the user
explicitly requesting the change. For example, a splash page may
redirect to a new location after 15 seconds, or a form element may load
a new page when it receives focus. These are both examples of
unrequested changes in context. These kinds of changes can be quite
disorienting for some assistive technology users, who may become lost or
confused as a result.</p>
<p>Another important part of understanding is <strong>being able to
recover from an error</strong> and knowing that a process or series of
steps has completed successfully, without errors. Providing accessible
messaging is important for many people. <strong>Preventing
errors</strong> before they happen, typically with warning messages, can
greatly reduce the effects of errors, not only for people with
disabilities but for everyone. <strong>Feedback after completing an
action</strong>, such as submitting a form, is a necessary element for
people using assistive technologies, who may spend a significant amount
of time confirming that a form they submitted was successful. And, for
anyone else, reading a simple “The form was submitted successfully” is a
more efficient way of confirming that than having to go through the
content that was submitted to make that confirmation.</p>
<h2>Unit 6: Robust</h2>
<p>This final unit is most useful for developers and programmers,
though, for non-developers who are studying web accessibility, it is
important to be aware of some of the technical aspects of implementing
web accessibility. The aim of this principle and its associated
guidelines is to ensure that web content works with as broad a range of
technologies as possible and will continue to work into the future as
associated web technologies evolve. This typically means <strong>using
web technologies, like HTML, to standard</strong>. When there are
non-standard uses, a standard fallback should be provided.</p>
<p>Developers will want to use a <strong>markup validator</strong> to
ensure that the HTML of the web pages they create is valid HTML. When
web content contains broken or invalid HTML, assistive technologies may
behave inconsistently and even be unable to access the content contained
in the broken markup. Though current web browsers are pretty good at
fixing broken markup on the fly, they cannot be relied upon to correct
all markup errors.</p>
<p>You were introduced to the importance of effective messaging with the
discussion on error feedback, and in this unit you are introduced to
WAI-ARIA’s version of effective feedback. <strong>WAI-ARIA alert,
status,</strong> and <strong>log roles</strong> can be used to
automatically announce feedback messages injected into already rendered
web content without reloading the page.</p>
<p>To wrap up we discuss WAI-ARIA. It can be used to make custom web
content accessible, using a combination of <strong>static and
dynamically generated WAI-ARIA</strong>. WAI-ARIA elements, like
landmarks, can be added directly to HTML, while much of it requires
<strong>JavaScript to control states, and sometimes properties</strong>,
as various interactions within the custom content occurs.</p>
