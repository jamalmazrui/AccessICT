Artificial Intelligence is a simulation of human intelligence. It seeks to imitate the ways in which we do things and think – but to do it through technology.

AI IS HERE TO STAY

[]Where AI is concerned, there are many questions and  uncertainties among persons with and without disabilities. What can it do for us? Are we replacing old barriers with new ones? Where does it already affect inclusion and accessibility, and what applications can be expected in the near future? In this publication Zero Project provides a helpful overview of the concept of AI, what it is and what it encompasses. More over, we address the specific concerns of persons with  disabilities and offer guidance on how to approach the subject. AI has already entered our lives and is here to stay. Therefore, it is better to learn how to live with it than to fight it.

What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

We already know that computers don’t think like humans do. Experts are divided as to whether they ever will.

For now, we can rely on AI systems to analyse data and look for patterns in order to make predictions about what will occur in the future. An AI system carries out actions depending on how and for what purpose that system is programmed. For example, Facebook uses AI to determine what ads to show its users. The decisions are based upon data gathered about the user. In this case, a complex equation, called an algorithm, processes the data in order to come to a conclusion as to which ads might interest a particular individual.

Face-recognition is AI

Another example is using facial recognition to open a locked smart phone. An algorithm compares the face being currently scanned with the one stored on the phone. If the scans match, the phone unlocks.

Text editors, social media, search algorithms, digital assistants such as Apple’s Siri, and smart devices such as refrigerators that make out shopping lists are all examples of AI in use right now.

Adapting these and emergent technologies to a barrier-free philosophy is of particular interest to Zero Project. A number of AI-based solutions are already being used or developed. Seeing AI, for example, is an app that uses cameras to see for the visually impaired.

Voiceitt recognizes speech patterns in order to help people with speech disabilities.

From real-time translation to better diagnoses

Access Innovation Media is a company developing an app that delivers transcriptions and captioning in real time. GnoSys, another AI-based app, translates sign language into text in real time. In medicine, AI helps to make better diagnoses and to accelerate rehabilitation. AI voice-assisted technologies such as Echo, Google Home, and Alexa are already improving the lives of millions. Open a door with a voice command, adjust the lighting with a gesture, or ask your smartphone to read a label out loud. These are just some examples of how AI can help people overcome barriers.

An AI-driven car learns to avoid accidents.

Imagine a tool that reads complex texts and creates accurate and comprehensible summaries, or a context-aware communication tool.

One such tool is Livox. It is an AI-driven customisable Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) app that allows people to easily use symbols to communicate. Another example comes from Tobii systems, which offers solutions that enable those with profound physical disabilities to operate computers with eye control. In the future, Tobii may implement AI to make the application less tiring for users.

From self-driving cars to warm, responsive robot caregivers, AI’s potential seems limitless. But not all future visions are rosy.

Where controversy starts

Some have warned that AI could become a deadly hazard. Even if a Hollywood-style robot uprising seems quite unlikely, unethical and careless use of AI technology has already lead to controversy.

For example, algorithms are often biased against different groups, including people with disabilities. It’s not enough to rectify these wrongs. Inclusion, accessibility, and equality need to be fundamental to current and future developments if AI is going to meet real-world needs.

Education, assistive technologies, automation, or any other application of AI will depend largely upon how we assess risks versus benefits. This in turn depends on how one defines those benefits. An inclusive, people-first perspective will help advance basic standards of accessibility and equality, which can be expanded upon as the technology evolves.

Imagine an app that helps blind customers pick up their parcels at the post office, or one that instantly translates speech into sign language on your smartphone.

These futuristic-sounding apps are already here. Voice- and gesture-controlled smart homes are on the way. Other near-future ideas include

The Cash Reader from the Czech company Hayaku recognizes bank notes from more than 100 countries, using AI.

New technologies, such as Artificial  Intelligence, can increase  accessibility and independence for persons with  disabilities. For example, incorporating AI in user interfaces and user interaction will be  particularly useful for persons with sensory and cognitive disabilities.

personalized learning that utilizes responsive AI to tailor course materials to individual needs, automated analysis tools for complex texts, and the complete automation of time-consuming repetitive tasks. Thanks to AI, this may be at the start of an age where tedium disappears along with barriers to personal independence. To get there together, inclusivity has to be made fundamental to emergent technologies.

Automated analysis of job applications

[]Alongside AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation (RPA, a technology that is automating jobs) can perform such tasks as reviewing applications, processing transactions, compiling data, or replying to emails. Looking forward, it is estimated that RPA could do about 45 per cent of what educated professionals now do for a living.

Experts have wildly different opinions about how this will affect the future workforce. Forrester Research indicates that 9 per cent of the global workforce could be directly threatened. Other research indicates that less than 5 per cent of occupations would be fully automated, but up to 60 per cent will be partially automated. One thing seems certain: no matter what you do, some of your future co-workers will be machines.

Automation and education:  tailored learning materials

AI-assisted personalized learning is on its way. Using a combination of online materials and AI-mediated feedback, educators and learners alike will have new tools at their disposal. For example, AI-based analysis of a learner’s abilities and history will make it simpler for teachers to tailor learning materials to specific needs.

Chatbots can take on the task of answering those FAQs that often distract educators from focusing on more challenging and individual tasks. AI can also relieve teachers of repetitive tasks, such as correcting homework, and it can help learners to overcome technical hurdles in their own individualized learning process.

General AI

This is a broader form of AI that seeks to teach             technologies to do things that people do.            

No time to draft that report, make that coffee,             or clean up that room? Just get General AI to       do it for you – better and more efficiently than     you ever could.      

General AI can deal with complex tasks that are repetitive, boring, or simply distracting for most of us. This technology is designed to take the drudgery out of our lives and free up time for more essential things. It can also replace humans where the task is especially dangerous or physically taxing.

Universities, companies, and the public sector

THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AI

Diverse stakeholders contribute in different ways to developing AI. Academics tend towards research, companies towards development, and the public sector often assumes a regulatory function.

 Whether the focus is development, implementation, or citizens’ rights, each has a vital role to play.

The New Schools:

Academic research

The Alan Turing Institute, created in 2015, is the United Kingdom’s institute for data science and Artificial Intelligence. The Institute studies computer sciences, mathematics, statistics, machine learning, engineering, and the social sciences to make advancements in data science and AI. It also boasts a Data Ethics Group interested in creating public dialogues on AI issues. www.turing.ac.uk

A New World of Business: Companies on the move

Google, which has been acquiring AI start-ups at a rapid rate, is by far the largest and most important AI company. Google’s CEO, Sundar Pichai, has suggested that the future is characterised by “evolving from a ‘mobile-first’ to an ‘AI-first’ world.”

In 2018, Microsoft launched the AI for Accessibility programme to provide technology-focused seed grants to developers, universities, non-governmental organizations, and inventors. That same year saw UNICEF launch its innovation fund for open AI development. Microsoft’s AI digital assistant,

Cortana, directly competes with Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant. In addition, AI features are a large part of the company’s Azure Cloud service, which provides chatbots and machine learning services to some of the world’s largest corporations. Microsoft also purchased five AI companies in 2018 alone.

IBM has been active in the field of AI for over 50 years. Through Watson, an AI-optimization tool, IBM created a machine-learning platform that can integrate AI into business processes, such as building chatbots for customer support.

Twitter uses AI to process visual information and to make recommendations for user timelines.

Facebook’s AI research group, FAIR, is committed to developing new communication technologies. This project became famous when the two negotiator AI systems, Alice and Bob, unexpectedly began to speak to each other in their own language!

Brave New Worlds:  

A European approach to regulation

Despite the emergence of guidelines from a number of different interested parties, there is no unified regulatory body or philosophy for AI ethics. International organizations such as the European Union, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and the International Telecommunication Union understand AI’s social and economic implications as vital issues in need of regulatory principles, but the truth is that the world is far from having a well regulated AI.

Although a “human-centred, inclusive approach” is roughly outlined here, it is clear that regulating AI is in its initial stages. Who will take the lead in determining the regulatory strategies of the future? What will it mean for people with a disability, for business, and life in general? Only time can tell.

The European Disability Forum has outlined a set of recommendations for policies that include:

•   privacy

•   accountability

•   safety/security

•   transparency/ease of explanation

•   fairness/non-discrimination

•   human control of technology

•   trustworthiness

•   involvement of persons with disability.

“ What’s good for people with a  disability is good for everybody!”

EXPERTS AND INNOVATORS

Three experts in the field of emerging tech and inclusion touch upon some key ideas and problems facing us today. Each points out different aspects of the ethical concerns stemming from AI use – and also how fixing these can create innovations that are useful for everyone.

[][]CHRISTOPHER PATNOE

“Building AI that is robust and reliable for all”

Innovations originally intended to aid those with a disability tend to become integrated into core design. Today, as Christopher Patnoe points out, there is a great blurring of the lines between tech designed for disability and innovations for mainstream application. This means that, generally speaking, what’s good for people with a disability is good for everybody.

Although there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic, Christopher points out that there are some major hurdles to be overcome. One of them has to do with equality of user experience. For example, many popular services for persons with disability are cloud-based, meaning that these services do not have the same level of effectiveness as those that only require a phone’s processor.

“There are so many discussions to be had as we progress – about privacy, functionality, cost – but most importantly we have to find ways to build robust AI that is reliable, because if someone is depending upon it, you need to make sure that it does not fail. And also that it doesn’t make predetermined choices for those with disabilities.”

Christopher Patnoe is Head of Access ibility and Inclusion at EMEA, Google.

SUSAN SCOTT PARKER

“The danger of  disability oblivious AI”

According to Susan Scott Parker, “we have AI developers who do not understand human reality, and disability being intrinsic to that reality, and we have poorly trained HR managers who don’t understand that we treat job seekers with disabilities differently to treat them fairly.”

Susan has become increasingly alarmed by the biases embedded in AI-powered HR tech. AI recruitment suppliers like to advertise the infallibility of their product without considering the true impact on the disability community. The result is “disability oblivious AI,” according to Susan. She is currently building an alliance through her new site Disability Ethical AI, which will become a hub for those combating AI-induced inequality. disabilityethicalai.org

| Jutta Treviranus and the exception to the rules                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Jutta Treviranus began working with AI to understand severely impaired speech. Lately she has been testing AI drivers. Jutta’s work on automated vehicles at intersections showed that a great deal was left to be desired when dealing with unusual situations. In one case, she tested the AI against its ability to deal with a person with cerebral palsy. This person typically made unusual movements – for example, navigating her way through pedestrian traffic backwards. In every single simulation the AI chose to run Jutta’s friend down!

Jutta discovered that machine learning based on big data analytics and optimization is dangerously biased against minorities. The more data used, the more confident was the AI in its decision to run over Jutta’s friend! Big Data simply does not like exceptions. This should do more than raise a few flags.

Assessing the implications for people with disabilities becomes paramount as AI becomes increasingly embedded in key decision-making. From the data perspective, any disability represents a major difference from the norm. Consequently, people with a disability are easy targets for bias. The machine does not like anomalies. This means jobs, loans, and college education are likely to be denied such persons on the basis of their inability to conform to predictive models. Security protocols may also identify persons with a disability as potential threats based on the same grounds.

[]So, are we looking out for AI bias now? How can we develop an ethics of AI decision-making? The answers are hardly satisfactory.

There are a number of reasons for this. First, people with disabilities represent a very large and diverse group. Also, many persons with a disability prefer not to be identified as such. In such cases, data optimization analytics would identify a difference, for example in work interruptions, that would penalize a potential candidate unfairly.

In other cases, using different assets or different methods to perform a job may be enough to unfairly single out a person with a disability. Since there is no common data characteristic that can be used to identify or define persons with a disability, AI decision-making systems are generally unable to combat bias on their own.

Jutta also found that people with disabilities are the most vulnerable when it comes to data abuse, misuse, and privacy concerns. Being unique within a dataset is a liability when anonymity is the primary way of protecting user identity from exploitation.

A potential way forward is to move from data exploitation to data exploration. Exploitation tries to replicate past successes through optimization. Exploration, however, is concerned with optimizing diversity and promoting novel methods.

Jutta Treviranus is Director and founder of the

Inclusive Design Research Center at the Ontario College of Art and Design. This page is a summary of a discussion with David Banes, Director of David Banes Access and Inclusion Services.

[][]NEHAT KRASNIQI

“Loneliness has an immense impact on our well-being”

Alana is a spin-off based out of Heriot-Watt  University, a public research university in Edinburgh, Scotland. Nehat Krasniqi, who has many years of experience in tech and outsourcing sectors, explained how the AI his company develops is based on human interaction and is often referred to as “conversational AI.” Alana can have long-form conversations on “pretty much any topic you want” and it can remember past conversational topics. Alana is a brilliant tool for alleviating the symptoms of anxiety caused by loneliness, both for people with or without a disability.

Alana “has a strong relationship with the blind community,” Nehat says, explaining that its first iteration will include “applications to record and describe the world around us by embedding state of the art vision AI to Alana’s dialogue.”

This means Alana can also help you find your keys or navigate through a room. Alana could become an indispensable guide for many. “For instance, the person might want a coffee at a train station, and by holding up their phones and turning 360 degrees, Alana will recognize a logo or individual and direct you to the door to buy that drink.”

Nehat is also keenly aware of the ethical issues involved in such technology. When should Alana seek help for a severely depressed person, for example? There is the danger of well meaning AI turning into a nuisance or a snitch. For now, the Alana team is looking to mental help lines as a possible model.

According to Nehat, Alana could “provide a vital piece of the jigsaw to address the social isolation of many with a disability and provide a companion.”

A summary of a conversation between,  Nehat Krasniqi, CEO of Alana, and David Banes.

KAMIL GOUNGOR

“Volunteers with disabilities add value to the organization’s work and mission”

Born 1988 in Greece, author and activist Kamil Goungor writes about travel tips for the budgetsavy accessible traveler for his blog The Trawheeler when he’s not busy as chairman of the European Disability Forum’s youth committee.

As an activist with the Independent Living movement, Kamil is aware of the ethical problems created by AI, but is generally optimistic about the benefits. He suggests that when hosting disabled volunteers, organizers should focus on the personal talents and needs of the volunteers. He would like to see bureaucracy dramatically reduced in order to make hosting disabled volunteers “sexier.”

“Flexibility is a key element during the whole volunteering period, as unexpected issues might arise,” he says. He hopes to ride in his own voice-controlled self-driving car some day and welcomes new advancements that will make brain-operated machinery and computers a reality for everyone.
