<p>Being</p>
<p>disabled</p>
<p>in Britain</p>
<p>A journey</p>
<p>less equal</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>About this publication</p>
<p>What is the aim of this publication? ‘Being disabled in Britain’ is a
review into disability inequality in Great Britain, offering
comprehensive evidence on whether our society lives up to its promise to
be fair to all its citizens. It builds on the Equality and Human Rights
Commission’s statutory five-yearly report on equality and human rights
progress in England, Scotland and Wales, ‘Is Britain Fairer? The state
of equality and human rights 2015.’ This review also draws on new
quantitative data analysis and our submission to the UN Committee on the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, published in February 2017, to
present a fuller and more up-to-date examination of the key challenges
facing disabled people in Britain.</p>
<p>Who is it for?</p>
<p>We want this report to be used by UK and devolved governments to make
improvements to law and policies, by local government to ensure services
meet the needs of disabled people, and by disability groups to
strengthen their case for change.</p>
<p>What is inside?</p>
<p>The report includes chapters on six core areas of life, including
education, work, health, justice and participation in politics, looking
at where there has been progress and where there are still serious
issues to be tackled. It also looks the experiences of those with
different impairments and how these impact on people’s life chances.</p>
<p>Why has the Commission produced this? The Equality and Human Rights
Commission promotes and enforces the laws that protect our rights to
fairness, dignity and respect. As part of its duties, the Commission
provides Parliament and the nation with periodic reports on equality and
human rights progress in England, Scotland and Wales.</p>

<p>Foreword from the Chair What is it like to be disabled in Great
Britain today? It’s fair to say that we have seen significant
improvements in the law to protect the rights of disabled people. Twenty
years ago the Disability Discrimination Act came into force, as the
first step towards tackling the shocking inequalities of the past. In
2009, the UK ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of
Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). In 2010 the Equality Act strengthened
protection from disability discrimination, and five years ago the nation
hosted the London 2012 Paralympic Games. There is no doubt that the
Games challenged some of the stereotypes about disabled people and
enabled us to celebrate their contribution to the nation. At face value
we have travelled far. But have these important legal protections really
changed the lives of disabled people? Have we achieved equality, or is
there still a long road ahead? In ‘Being disabled in Britain: A journey
less equal’ we seek to answer these questions. We have analysed the
latest data on the experiences of disabled people in Great Britain in
more detail than has ever been done before. We look at many types of
impairment in all areas of life – from education, working life,
standards of living, and health care, to security and participation in
politics.</p>
<p>Our report shows that in many sectors we have failed to make real
progress, and in some areas we have even gone backwards. Disabled people
are being left behind in comparison with others in society; some groups
of disabled people – in particular those with mental health conditions
and learning disabilities – experience even greater barriers. More
families that include a disabled person live in poverty; access to
mental health care is inadequate; and housing and transport fail to
support disabled people to live independently and fulfil their potential
and aspirations.</p>
<p>The conclusion we must draw from the evidence is that disabled people
are still being treated as second-class citizens. Progress to date is
not sufficient, and the road to disability equality is littered with
missed opportunities and failures. It is a badge of shame on our society
and successive governments that this has happened. The Equality Act 2010
has still not been implemented in full, the CRPD has not been
incorporated into domestic law and policy, life chances for disabled
people remain very poor, and public attitudes to disabled people have
changed very little. We want this report to be the start of a concerted
effort to deliver the changes that are desperately needed. The evidence
can no longer be ignored. This report must be used by the UK and
devolved governments to make improvements to law and policies, by local
government to ensure services meet the needs of disabled people, and by
disability groups to strengthen their case for change.</p>
<p>Now is the time for a new national focus on the rights of the 13
million disabled people who live in Britain. They must not be treated
any less favourably than any other citizens. Britain must be a fair and
inclusive society in which everyone has equal opportunities to thrive
and succeed. To achieve this we must put the rights of disabled people
at the heart of our society. <strong>We cannot, and must not, allow the
next 20 years to repeat the past.</strong> <strong>David Isaac</strong>,

<p>Executive summary 7</p>
<p>Executive summary</p>
<p>In ‘Being disabled in Britain 2016: A journey less equal’ we assess
the state of equality and human rights for disabled people in Britain
and set out the key areas requiring improvement. While progress has been
made in some areas, the overall picture emerging from the data is that
disabled people are facing more barriers and falling further behind. It
is a badge of shame on our society that millions of disabled people in
Britain are still not being treated as equal citizens and continue to be
denied the everyday rights non-disabled people take for granted, such as
being able to access transport, appropriate health services and housing,
or benefit from education and employment. The disability pay gap is
persistent and widening, access to justice has deteriorated, and welfare
reforms have significantly affected the already low living standards of
disabled people. It is essential that as a society we recognise and
address these structural problems urgently and comprehensively. We are
calling for a new national focus on disability rights, so that disabled
people are no longer treated as ‘second-class citizens’.</p>
<p><strong>The key challenges to disability equality</strong> In our
review ‘Is Britain Fairer?’ (EHRC, 2015), we presented the key equality
and human rights challenges for all protected characteristic groups in
Britain, and concluded that greater effort was needed to identify the
scale and nature of the issues affecting disabled people. This report
builds on that evidence and also draws on new quantitative data analysis
and our submission to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities, published in February 2017, to present a fuller and more
up-to-date examination of the key challenges facing disabled people in
Britain.</p>
<p>Our purpose is to report our findings, set out the challenges for the
future, and invite all concerned to address the issues by identifying
and implementing the necessary solutions. This report does not speculate
on the impact of proposed future legislative or policy changes, nor try
to explain the causes of differences, or offer policy solutions. Our
report sets out evidence-based findings in six key areas of life:
education, work, standard of living, health and care, justice and
detention, and participation and identity. It highlights the key issues
described on the next page which are affecting the lives of disabled
people in Britain.</p>
<p>Educational attainment</p>
<p>of children with Special</p>
<p>Educational Needs</p>
<p>Non-disabled SEN</p>
<p>8 Being disabled in Britain Being disabled in Britain</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Disabled pupils in England, Wales and Scotland have much lower
attainment rates at school than non-disabled pupils, and are
significantly more likely to be permanently or temporarily excluded.
Furthermore, there is a need to address bullying experienced by disabled
children and the levels of support they are offered.</p>
<p>In England and Wales, in 2014/15 the educational attainment of
children with Special Educational Needs (SEN) was nearly three times
lower than for non-disabled children. Across Britain in 2015/16,
disabled young people aged 16-18 were at least twice as likely as their
non-disabled peers to not be in education, employment or training
(NEET). Having a degree-level qualification can significantly improve
employment outcomes. The employment gap is smaller between disabled (60%
employed six months after graduating, in 2009/10) and non-disabled
graduates (65% employed) compared with the gap in the general
population. Although the qualification gap between disabled and
non-disabled people narrowed between 2010/11 and 2015/16, the proportion
of disabled people with no qualifications was nearly three times that of
non-disabled people in 2015/16, and the proportion of disabled people
with a degree remained lower than that of non-disabled people.</p>
<p>Work</p>
<p>Disabled people across Britain are less likely to be in employment
than non-disabled people. Since 2010 there has been extensive reform to
UK Government employment support programmes (Access to Work and the Work
Programme), but there are specific concerns about their effectiveness
for disabled people. In particular, non-disabled people (35%) are more
likely than disabled people (18%) to get a job on the Work Programme.
Despite an increase in the proportion of both disabled and non-disabled
adults in employment in Britain in 2015/16, less than half of disabled
adults were in employment (47.6%), compared with almost 80% of the
non-disabled adult population, and the gap between these groups has
widened since 2010/11.</p>
<p>The disability pay gap in Britain continues to widen. In 2015-16
there was a gap in median hourly earnings: disabled people earned £9.85
compared with £11.41 for non-disabled people. Disabled young people (age
16-24) and disabled women had the lowest median hourly earnings.</p>
<p>Very low numbers of disabled people are taking up apprenticeships,
and there has been little improvement in that situation in England and
Wales, although Scotland has seen a slight improvement.</p>
<p>Executive summary 9</p>
<p>Standard of living</p>
<p>More disabled people than non-disabled are living in poverty or are
materially deprived. Social security reforms have had a particularly
disproportionate, cumulative impact on rights to independent living and
an adequate standard of living for disabled people. UK data from 2014/15
shows that 30% of working-age adults in families where at least one
member is disabled were living in households with below 60% of
contemporary median income after housing costs, compared with 18% for
those living in families with no disabled members. Across Great Britain,
59% of families with children, that were in income poverty and that
contained a disabled person, lived in material deprivation in 2014/15,
compared with an average material deprivation rate of 20%.</p>
<p>Across the UK, 18.4% of disabled people aged 16-64 were considered to
be in food poverty in 2014 compared with just 7.5% of non-disabled
people. Disabled people over the age of 65 were twice as likely as
non-disabled people in the same age group to be in food poverty: 6.8%
compared with 3.3%.</p>
<p>A higher proportion of disabled people have been affected by the
under-occupancy charge (‘bedroom tax’) than non-disabled people, as
evidenced in the Department for Work and Pensions' Equality Impact
Assessment. In England and Wales, at least 47% of housing benefit
claimants affected by the under-occupancy charge have a disability.
Families with a disabled child have also been affected by the charge.
Disabled people face problems in finding adequate housing and this is a
major barrier to independent living. There is a shortage of accessible
housing across Britain: of councils in England with a housing plan,
fewer than 17% have set out strategies to build disabled-friendly homes.
In Scotland the amount of wheelchair-adapted local authority housing for
physically disabled people has decreased.</p>
<p>As resources become scarcer, and funding for specialist services for
disabled people disappears, disabled people are finding it more and more
difficult to access support.</p>

<p>Health and care</p>
<p>Disabled people are more likely to experience health inequalities and
major health conditions, and are likely to die younger than other
people. The extent of these health inequalities is difficult to assess
because of limited data on outcomes for disabled people collected by NHS
providers and commissioners. Accessibility of services is problematic,
and disabled people are less likely to report positive experiences in
accessing healthcare services.</p>
<p>Despite a commitment by governments to make improvements to the
provision of mental health services, considerable shortcomings remain in
all three countries (England, Scotland and Wales), where disabled adults
are more likely to report poor mental health and wellbeing than
non-disabled adults. In England, the waiting time target for access to
psychological therapies has been cut to 28 days, but some people have
waited for over 90 days. The majority of Health Boards in Scotland have
failed to meet the target to ensure access to psychological therapies
for all patients within 18 weeks from referral to treatment. Reduced
funding in specialist child and adolescent mental health service
provision in England has amounted to 25% cuts between 2011 and 2013 in
some areas; the NHS reports an increase in average waiting times to 15
weeks between 2011 and 2013. • On average, men with mental health
conditions die 20 years earlier than the general</p>
<p>population, and women 13 years earlier.</p>
<p>• ‘Do not attempt resuscitation’ (DNAR) notices are being placed on
patients’ files without</p>

restraint for the purposes of</p>

<p>Executive summary 11</p>
<p>Justice and detention</p>
<p>There is an urgent need for prisons to monitor and report on prisoner
mental health. Prisoners are more likely to have mental health
conditions compared with the general population, and 70% of prisoners
that died from self-inflicted means between 2012 and 2014 had an
identified mental health need.</p>
<p>Detentions in health and social care settings under the Mental Health
Act 1983 are continuing to increase in England and Wales and this is a
strong concern, particularly as evidence suggests there are flaws in the
way those detained are assessed and treated. • The use of section 136 of
the Mental Health Act 1983 (under which people are brought to</p>
<p>hospital as a ‘place of safety’) increased by 18% to 22,965 in 2016,
while the number of</p>
<p>detentions in hospitals increased between 2009/10 and 2016 (from
46,600 in 2009/10 to</p>
<p>63,622 in 2016).</p>
<p>The UK continues to be the only country in the European Union with no
time limit on immigration detention, and there is a concern that
immigration detention facilities are inadequately equipped to deal with
detainees who have a mental health condition. Disabled people in Britain
are more likely to have experienced crime than non-disabled people. In
Scotland, disabled people were less likely to feel safe walking alone in
their neighbourhood after dark compared with non-disabled people.
Similarly in England and Wales, disabled people were more likely to feel
unsafe walking alone in their local area during the day, and were more
likely to report feeling worried about physical attack and acquisitive
crime compared with non-disabled people. Disability hate crimes recorded
by the police in England and Wales increased by 44% in 2015/16 on the
previous year, possibly reflecting improved reporting and recording
practices. Despite this improvement, a joint inspection team from HMI
Constabulary, HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate and HMI
Probation found that criminal justice agencies do not always understand
what forms disability hate crime can take, and that more needs to be
done to understand how disabled people experience hate crime. This
includes the ways in which disabled people are targeted and the
difficulties they face in getting public authorities to respond. In
Scotland in 2014/15, crimes reported with an aggravation of prejudice
relating to disability increased by 20% compared with the previous year,
86% of which proceeded to court.</p>
<p>Changes to legal aid in England and Wales have negatively affected
disabled people’s access to justice in family law, housing, employment,
debt and welfare benefits cases. Across Great Britain, there has been a
54% drop in employment tribunal claims on grounds of disability
discrimination between 2012/13 and 2015/16.</p>
<p>12 Being disabled in Britain Being disabled in Britain</p>
<p>Participation and identity</p>
<p>Disabled people continue to encounter barriers to exercising their
right to vote. Disabled people are also under-represented in political
office and public appointments, and face continued challenges to
achieving equal representation. There is an urgent need for the
implementation of section 106 of the Equality Act 2010, so that
political parties are required to publish diversity data about their
candidates.</p>
<p>Poor access to transport, leisure and other services can affect the
community and social life of disabled people, creating a barrier to
independence and their enjoyment of day-to-day activities. Across Great
Britain, there was an overall increase between 2009-11 and 2012-14 in
the percentage of disabled and non-disabled adults who reported having
difficulty accessing services in the areas of health, benefits, tax,
culture, sport and leisure. In 2012-14 this was 45.3% for disabled
people compared with 31.7% for non-disabled people. The wide gap in
internet usage between disabled and non-disabled people has persisted.
The law leaves a degree of interpretation for service providers about
how far they are required to go to increase digital accessibility and
there is as yet no UK case law precedent on web accessibility to clarify
the position. Disabled people reported difficulties accessing their
bank, having a credit history and affording insurance, all of which
exacerbate the financial penalty they face and can limit their family
life and opportunities to learn, work and participate in society.</p>
<p>Negative attitudes towards disabled people remain prominent in
Britain, and people with a mental health condition, learning disability
or memory impairment remain particularly likely to be stigmatised.
Measures of disability prejudice have focused largely on disability as a
general category. There is a lack of evidence on how people’s attitudes
towards disability differ by disability type.</p>

<p><strong>Evidence and action on disability rights</strong> More needs
to be done to improve the evidence base on the issues facing disabled
people. In particular, better evidence is needed about the experiences
and outcomes of disabled people who have specific impairments or
multiple disabilities, and to understand the issues for disabled people
of different ethnic groups, ages or sexual orientations. Legislation,
policies, frameworks and actions plans need to be targeted at addressing
the inequalities experienced by disabled people, and their impact on
disabled people needs to be monitored and evaluated. For example:</p>
<p>• England, Wales and Scotland have action plans in place to tackle
the obesity crisis, but</p>
<p>these do not address the specific needs of disabled people, for whom
weight and obesity are a particular problem but who may face barriers to
forms of physical activity.</p>
<p>• There are inconsistent levels of protection for disabled people. In
Scotland, unlike in</p>
<p>England and Wales, there is currently no specific offence of
emotional abuse under criminal law, which means that perpetrators of
this form of abuse cannot be prosecuted for that particular crime.</p>
<p>• There are strong concerns about how the implementation of the
Department for</p>
<p>Transport’s Accessibility Action Plan is being monitored, despite a
House of Commons Transport Committee recommendation that the UK
Government publish annual updates about implementation of the plan,
including data on changes in the number and types of journeys made by
disabled people.</p>
<p>The United Nations Committee on the Convention on the Rights of the
Child, the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination
Against Women and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights have all highlighted the disparities that exist for
disabled children and adults across all areas of life. This year, the UK
Government will be examined on its performance under the Convention on
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), with the expectation
that it will ensure the resulting recommendations are addressed through
legislation, policies, frameworks and action plans. However, there is
currently no domestic mechanism requiring Ministers to have regard to
the CRPD when developing new policy and law.</p>
<p>Executive summary 15</p>
<p>Recommendations</p>
<p>This report looks at six key areas of life and finds that disabled
people in Britain are experiencing disadvantages in all of them. But our
lives are not lived in neat and distinct categories, and it is critical
that policy makers and influencers across all sectors recognise how the
issues we have identified interact and accumulate throughout disabled
people’s life journeys. For example, being unable to access appropriate
health services or public transport affects people’s ability to access
and benefit from education or work. We are calling on the UK, Scottish
and Welsh Governments to place a new national focus on disability
equality, so that the rights of disabled people are fully realised, and
to deliver improvements in disabled people’s experience and outcomes. We
recommend that the UK and devolved governments take concerted action
to:</p>
<p>1. Reduce educational attainment and employment gaps</p>
<p>for disabled people.</p>
<p>2. Ensure that essential services, such as housing, health,
transport</p>
<p>and justice, meet the particular needs of disabled people and</p>
<p>support their independence and wellbeing.</p>
<p>3. Promote the inclusion and participation of disabled people in
civic</p>
<p>and political life.</p>
<p>4. Strengthen disabled people’s choice, autonomy and control over</p>
<p>decisions and services.</p>
<p>5. Improve existing legislation, policies, frameworks and action</p>
<p>plans to better protect and promote the rights of disabled
people.</p>
<p>6. Improve the evidence base on the experiences and outcomes of</p>
<p>disabled people and the ability to assess how fair Britain is for
all</p>
<p>disabled people.</p>
<p>To support implementation of these recommendations, we will work with
governments and key influencers to raise awareness of the evidence – in
this report, the CRPD concluding observations and the joint Disability
Rights UK, Disability Wales, and Inclusion Scotland report – and to
identify the action that needs to be taken to make progress.</p>

Being disabled in Britain</p>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>In ‘Being disabled in Britain: A journey less equal’ we assess the
state of equality and human rights for disabled people in Britain and
set out the key areas requiring improvement. This builds upon our work
in ‘Is Britain Fairer?’ that presented key equality and human rights
challenges for all protected characteristic groups in Britain and found
greater effort was needed to identify the scale and nature of the issues
affecting disabled people. We therefore present the latest available
evidence for England, Scotland and Wales across six major areas of life.
Within each of these areas, we have used a set of indicators and
measures to assess progress:</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong> educational attainment, exclusions and
bullying in schools, adult educational qualifications and young people
not in education, employment or training (NEET)</p>
<p><strong>Work:</strong> employment, unemployment and pay, access to
work and apprenticeships, and the impact of welfare reforms</p>
<p><strong>Standard of living:</strong> poverty and material
deprivation, availability of support and housing <strong>Health and
care:</strong> health inequalities, obesity, mental health, social care
and support, healthcare for people with a learning disability</p>
<p><strong>Justice and detention:</strong> detention, experiences and
perceptions of crime, hate crime, legal aid</p>
<p><strong>Participation and identity:</strong> political participation
and representation, access to services, and discrimination, abuse,
attitudes and stigma</p>
<p>There are inevitably limitations to any evidence-gathering process
owing to gaps in data and difficulties involved in collecting
information. While recognising these limitations, this report presents a
rich range of evidence on the extent to which disabled people’s rights
are being realised in practice. It does not speculate on the impact of
proposed future legislative or policy changes, nor try to explain the
causes of differences, or offer policy solutions. The UK Parliament has
given the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), together with the
Scottish Human Rights Commission, the Northern Ireland Human Rights
Commission, and the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, the role
of the UK Independent Mechanism (UKIM) on the Convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). The UKIM has responsibility for
promoting, protecting and monitoring implementation of CRPD in the UK.
This report informs the UKIM submission to the UN Committee on the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities – the expert body overseeing
implementation of the treaty – published in February 2017. The key
challenges set out in this report complement recommendations made to the
UN Committee in our CRPD submission for action by the UK Government and
devolved governments. We believe that this report will be of value to
policy makers and influencers across all sectors. Our purpose is to
report our findings, set out the challenges for the future, and invite
all concerned (particularly those with relevant statutory
responsibilities) to address the issues by identifying and implementing
the necessary solutions.</p>
<p>Introduction 17</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>The EHRC has a statutory requirement to regularly report to the UK
Parliament on progress in society towards equality and human rights in
Britain. To fulfil this duty, we have developed four measurement
frameworks to monitor and evaluate progress in a systematic and
consistent way across England, Scotland and Wales. These measurement
frameworks cover equality for adults (Alkire <em>et al.</em>, 2009) and
for children (Holder <em>et al.</em>, 2011), good relations (Wigfield
and Turner, 2010), and human rights (Candler <em>et al.</em>, 2011). The
latter is based on the ‘Human Rights Indicators: Guide to Measurement
and Implementation’ by the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR, 2012). We will present three
different types of evidence:</p>
<p><strong>• Structure:</strong> the human rights and equality standards
to which the UK is committed,</p>
<p>as evidenced by the Human Rights Act 1998, the Equality Act 2010, the
European</p>
<p>Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), CRPD and other treaties the UK has
signed and</p>
<p>ratified.</p>
<p><strong>• Process:</strong> efforts that are being made by the State
and duty holders to meet the</p>
<p>obligations that flow from these human rights standards, including
primary legislation, and</p>
<p>regulatory and public policy frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>• Outcome:</strong> the position and experiences of disabled
people, evidenced by social survey</p>
<p>or administration data, and concerns highlighted by regulators,
inspectorates, human</p>
<p>rights monitoring bodies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or
academic studies. In this report, we cover government responsibilities
across England, Wales and Scotland, some of which are reserved to
Westminster (for example, employment) and some of which are devolved
(for example, health and housing). As a rule of thumb, where a matter is
devolved, we cover the legislative, regulatory and public policy
framework (Process) and the experiences of disabled people (Outcomes)
separately for the three countries. Where a matter is reserved, we
present Process and Outcome evidence at a Great Britain (GB) level;
however, there are some exceptions.</p>
<p>The report draws on both qualitative and quantitative evidence that
meets the EHRC’s quality criteria, as explained in the ‘Is Britain
Fairer?’ Methodology paper (EHRC, 2015). The <strong>qualitative
evidence</strong> is based on reports by inspectorates and regulators,
parliamentary committees, the UK and devolved governments, academia and
NGOs. The <strong>quantitative evidence</strong> draws on major surveys
and administrative data compiled by public bodies. In this report we
have relied on different sets of quantitative data: • Our own secondary
data analysis of survey and administrative data (including national</p>
<p>surveys on crime, health, population and life opportunities, and
administrative data on</p>
<p>education), broken down by impairments and showing change over time
for GB, England,</p>
<p>Wales and Scotland separately (where possible). The analysis was done
between</p>
<p>September and December 2016 (see Appendix A for a list of data tables
and Appendix B</p>
<p>for mappings between impairment categories used in this report and
the classifications</p>
<p>used in the main surveys analysed).</p>
<p>18 Being disabled in Britain</p>
<p>• Our own intersectional analysis of survey and administrative data,
using the broader</p>
<p>disabled and non-disabled categories, showing change over time, and
taking into account the full range of protected characteristics,
socio-economic status and other variables that may be associated with
particular outcomes. This analysis was done in December 2016 (see
Appendix C).</p>
<p>• Our own secondary data analysis of survey and administrative data,
broken down by</p>
<p>disabled and non-disabled people, which was published as part of the
‘Is Britain Fairer?’ series in October 2015 (EHRC, 2015).</p>
<p>• We have supplemented these with quantitative data drawn from other
published</p>
<p>analyses.</p>

rights standards 19</p>
<p>2. Human rights standards</p>
<p>This chapter summarises the most relevant aspects of the current
equality and human rights legal framework that protect the rights of
disabled people in Britain: • international human rights treaties signed
and ratified by the UK, including the Convention</p>
<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</p>
<p>• the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA)</p>
<p>• Wales and Scotland specific standards</p>
<p>• the Equality Act 2010.</p>
<p><strong>International human rights instruments</strong> The UK has
signed and ratified a number of international human rights instruments:
• International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) •
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)
• Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) •
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)</p>
<p>• Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
against Women (CEDAW) • International Convention on the Elimination of
All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) • Convention against Torture
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or</p>
<p>Punishment (CAT).1</p>
<p>While these international treaties are legally binding on the UK,
they do not create free-standing individual rights that serve as a cause
of action in legal proceedings because they have not been directly
incorporated into domestic law. Instead, a number of rights are given at
least partial effect domestically through legislation, such as the
Equality Act 20102 and the Human Rights Act 1998,3 and a mixture of
policies and programmes. In addition, international treaties can be
considered by domestic courts and the European Court of Human Rights
when interpreting other relevant applicable rights, and the UK is under
an obligation to comply. Under the Scotland Act 1998 and the Government
of Wales Act 2006 neither the Scottish Parliament nor the Welsh Assembly
can pass legislation that is incompatible with the Human Rights Act
(HRA).</p>
<p><strong>Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities</strong> The UK ratified the CRPD in 2009. The purpose of
the CRPD is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment
of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with
disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity. The UK
has also ratified the Optional Protocol to the CRPD, which enables the
UN Committee overseeing the CRPD to hear complaints from individuals or
groups who claim their CRPD rights have been violated.</p>
<p>20 Being disabled in Britain</p>
<p>As a State Party to the CRPD, the UK is legally bound to comply with
its provisions, which cover a broad range of civil, political, social,
economic and cultural rights for disabled people. Article 4 contains
general obligations for all States Parties to: eliminate discrimination
on the basis of disability; involve disabled people in developing and
implementing legislation and policies; and adopt all appropriate
legislative, administrative and other measures for the implementation of
the rights recognised in the CRPD. The HRA is of great importance in
providing disabled people with a remedy when their rights have been
violated; however, a number of rights contained in the CRPD,
particularly socio-economic rights, are not covered by the HRA.</p>
<p>There is currently no explicit statutory requirement or non-statutory
commitment for Ministers to have due regard to the CRPD when developing
new policy and law.</p>
<p>Human Rights Act 1998</p>
<p>Under the HRA, it is unlawful for all public bodies and other bodies
carrying out public functions as defined under the Act to act in a way
that is incompatible with rights set out in the European Convention on
Human Rights (ECHR). This obligation is both negative (that is, not to
breach the rights) and in certain circumstances positive (that is, to
take steps to guarantee the rights). The HRA does not create any new
rights that are not in the ECHR. There are three types of ECHR
rights:</p>
<p><strong>Absolute rights</strong> – for example, the right to life and
protection from torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. The State
cannot breach these rights in any circumstances. <strong>Limited
rights</strong> – for example, the right to liberty and security of
person, and to a fair trial. These may only be limited under the
circumstances set out in the ECHR Article defining the right.</p>
<p><strong>Qualified rights</strong> – for example, respect for private
and family life, freedom of assembly and association, and freedom to
manifest thoughts, conscience and religion. These require a balance to
be made between the rights of the individual and the needs and rights of
others, including wider society or the State. They can be interfered
with under specific circumstances set out in each Article, which include
where:</p>
<p>• there is a legal basis for this interference, which people can find
out about and understand</p>
<p>• there is a legitimate aim for the interference</p>
<p>• the interference is necessary in a democratic society; there must
be a pressing social need</p>
<p>for the interference</p>
<p>• the interference is proportionate (that is, it must be no greater
than is necessary to meet this</p>
<p>social need).</p>
<p>Article 14 of the ECHR provides the right for people to be free from
discrimination in enjoying their human rights under the Convention.
However, Article 14 is not a free-standing right. Anyone wishing to rely
on Article 14 must establish that the matter falls within the ambit of
another Convention right, and discrimination does not breach another
Convention right if it can be justified as a proportionate means of
achieving a legitimate aim.</p>
<p>Human rights standards 21</p>
<p>Wales and Scotland</p>
<p>The Government of Wales Act 2006 stipulates that:</p>
<p>• a provision of an Act of the Welsh Assembly is outside the
Assembly’s legislative</p>
<p>competence if it is incompatible with ECHR rights</p>
<p>• Welsh Ministers cannot act incompatibly with these rights. The
Rights of Children and Young Persons (Wales) Measure (2011) provides a
statutory duty for Welsh Ministers to have due regard to part 1 of the
Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).</p>
<p>The Scotland Act 1998 stipulates that:</p>
<p>• a provision of an Act of the Scottish Parliament is not law so far
as it is incompatible with</p>
<p>ECHR rights</p>
<p>• a Member of the Scottish Parliament has no power to make any
subordinate legislation or</p>
<p>to carry out any other act, so far as the legislation or act is
incompatible with ECHR rights. The Children and Young People (Scotland)
Act 2014 also places a duty on Scottish Ministers to keep under
consideration the requirements of the CRC.</p>
<p>Equality Act 2010</p>
<p>The Equality Act 2010 prohibits unlawful discrimination, harassment
and victimisation on the basis of what are called ‘protected
characteristics’ in a wide variety of fields, including employment,
education, the exercise of public functions, and the provision of
services and associations.</p>
<p>The nine ‘protected characteristics’ are: age; disability; gender
reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; pregnancy and maternity;
race; religion or belief; sex; sexual orientation. Prohibited conduct
takes a number of forms, although not all are relevant to all protected
characteristics. Prohibited conduct includes the following: •
<strong>Direct disability discrimination</strong> – less favourable
treatment of a disabled person because</p>
<p>of their disability compared with others who are not disabled. •
<strong>Indirect disability discrimination</strong> – where a policy,
practice or criterion is applied to</p>
<p>everyone (or would be), but in fact puts (or would put) disabled
people at a particular</p>
<p>disadvantage when compared with others who are not disabled. Indirect
disability</p>
<p>discrimination can be lawful if objectively justified as a
proportionate means of achieving a</p>
<p>legitimate aim.</p>
<p>• <strong>Discrimination arising from disability</strong> – less
favourable treatment of a disabled person,</p>
<p>because of something arising in consequence of the disabled person’s
disability, where</p>
<p>the less favourable treatment cannot be shown to be a proportionate
means of achieving</p>
<p>a legitimate aim. Discrimination arising from disability does not
occur if the person does</p>
<p>not know, and could not reasonably be expected to know, that the
disabled person has the</p>
<p>disability.</p>
<p>22 Being disabled in Britain</p>
<p>• <strong>Duty to make reasonable adjustments</strong> –
discrimination against a disabled person occurs</p>
<p>where there is a failure to comply with a duty to make reasonable
adjustments. The duty comprises three requirements:</p>
<p>- Where a provision, criterion or practice puts disabled people at a
substantial disadvantage</p>
<p>compared with those who are not disabled, take reasonable steps to
avoid that disadvantage.</p>
<p>- Take reasonable steps to remove or alter a physical feature or
provide a reasonable</p>
<p>means of avoiding such a feature where it puts a disabled person at a
substantial disadvantage compared with those who are not disabled.</p>
<p>- Take reasonable steps to provide an auxiliary aid where a disabled
person would, but</p>
<p>for the provision of that auxiliary aid, be put at a substantial
disadvantage compared with those who are not disabled.</p>
<p>• <strong>Harassment related to disability</strong> – unwanted
conduct related to a person’s disability that</p>
<p>has the purpose or effect of violating the person’s dignity, or
creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive
environment for that person.</p>
<p>• <strong>Victimisation</strong> – subjecting someone to a detriment
because they have, in good faith,</p>
<p>carried out a protected act, such as:</p>
<p>- making an allegation of discrimination</p>
<p>- bringing proceedings under the Equality Act 2010</p>
<p>- giving evidence or information in relation to such proceedings-
doing anything else in connection with the Equality Act 2010.</p>
<p>The Equality Act 2010 permits proportionate positive action measures
that aim to overcome disadvantage connected to a particular protected
characteristic. The Equality Act 2010 goes further in relation to the
protected characteristic of disability than it does for other protected
characteristics: it is not discrimination to treat a disabled person

<p>3. Education</p>
<p>This chapter reviews evidence relating to disabled people’s access to
and experiences of education, from primary school level through to
tertiary education and lifelong learning. Education is a fundamental
human right that enables people to access other rights, including an
adequate standard of living and the highest attainable standard of
health.</p>
<p>Five specific indicators were chosen to assess how well disabled</p>
<p>people’s rights relating to education are protected in Britain. These
are:</p>
<p>1. Educational attainment for children and young people</p>
<p>2. Exclusions from schools</p>
<p>3. Bullying in schools</p>
<p>4. Young people not in education, employment or training (NEET)</p>
<p>5. Educational qualifications for adults.</p>
<p>Due to the devolved arrangements, England, Wales and Scotland
have</p>
<p>different legislative, regulatory and public policy frameworks in
place,</p>
<p>all of which make provisions for protecting disabled people’s rights
to</p>
<p>education. There remain some similarities across countries,
particularly</p>
<p>between England and Wales.</p>

<p>Data gaps</p>
<p>More information is needed about the extent and nature of bullying
regarding children with SEN, ASN and disabilities, particularly the
different issues faced by those with specific impairments. There is also
less evidence on what causes the high exclusion rate of children with
SEND and ASN and how this can be tackled. In England and Wales, the
effectiveness of the new Education, Health and Care plans is not fully
clear. There are also concerns that many children without a formal plan,
but with some sort of need, are not being properly supported. Research
is needed to identify the causal links between disability and NEET
status among young people.</p>
<p>In Scotland, the National Improvement Framework for Education focuses
on improving data collection, including assessing children’s performance
throughout their school career. However, there is no commitment to
collect data and evidence about the educational performance of disabled
children and young people.</p>

<p>This chapter is concerned with the opportunity for individuals to
undertake paid work and how disabled people engage with the labour
market, including levels of employment and unemployment, as well as pay.
Some disabled people will not be able to work, but are nevertheless
entitled to an adequate standard of living and social protection. Thus
this chapter looks at how disabled people interact with the welfare
state and, in particular, the impact of welfare reforms.</p>
<p>Four specific indicators were chosen to assess how well disabled</p>
<p>people’s rights relating to work, income and the economy are
protected</p>
<p>in Britain. These are:</p>

<p>2. Access to apprenticeships</p>
<p>3. Earnings</p>
<p>4. Welfare reforms</p>
<p>This chapter covers government responsibilities that are reserved
(for</p>
<p>example, employment law) and others that are devolved (for
example,</p>
<p>modern apprenticeships) in England, Wales and Scotland. Where a</p>
<p>matter is devolved, we cover the legal and policy framework

<p>The UK Government’s Work Choices scheme is available in Wales;

Furthermore, there is a distinct lack of legislation, guidance and
advice in Wales for disabled employees and for employers seeking to
recruit disabled staff. There is also a lack of research, data and
statistical analysis of disabled people’s employment rates and pay and
no information on different industries, sectors or locations in
Wales.</p>
<p>There are considerable data gaps on apprenticeships (not just
relating to disability) including: a lack of information on the quality
(as opposed to the quantity) of apprenticeships; a lack of data on adult
apprenticeships, for example, those filled by the 25 and over age group;
and a lack of data on completion rates (as opposed to starts) and the
reasons why some apprentices fail to complete. There is no cumulative
impact assessment of welfare policies currently undertaken by the UK
Government. The EHRC and the Scottish Human Rights Commission (SHRC) are
assisting the Scottish Government in looking at the potential cumulative
impacts of those benefits devolved to the Scottish Government in
2016.</p>

<p>5. Standard of living</p>
<p>This chapter is concerned with the opportunity for individuals to
enjoy an adequate and secure standard of living with adequate support.
Measuring poverty and material deprivation helps us to assess a person’s
ability to live with independence, dignity and self-respect. An adequate
income is essential to enable an individual to enjoy a secure standard
of living, including all aspects of life that this entails, such as
housing, food, warmth, social security, social services and utilities,
and being cared for and supported when necessary. For disabled people
and those with a long-term condition, adequate housing means living in
homes that are adapted to specific needs and close to services, care and
facilities that allow them to live their lives in dignity and
freedom.</p>
<p>Three specific indicators were chosen to assess how well disabled
people’s rights to an</p>
<p>adequate standard of living are protected in Britain. These are:</p>
<p>1. Poverty and material deprivation</p>
<p>2. Availability of support</p>
<p>3. Housing</p>

(for example,</p>

<p>6. Health and care</p>
<p>This chapter is concerned with the health of disabled people and
their use of and access to health and social care services.</p>
<p>This involves disabled people’s capability to attain the highest
possible standard of physical and mental health. It also involves having
access to timely and impartial information about health and healthcare
options. The ability of disabled people to have access to healthcare
without discrimination, and in a culturally sensitive way, is also
crucial to their experience of healthcare, as is giving informed consent
to receiving medical treatment or participating in medical
experimentation. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and being able to live
in a healthy and safe environment are also discussed in this chapter.
Where health is poorer for some groups than others, the evidence may
indicate a need for policy or practice to address such inequalities and
to ensure that all groups can enjoy sufficient and similar levels of
health and healthcare.</p>
<p>Five specific indicators were chosen to assess how well the rights of
disabled people</p>
<p>relating to health and care are protected in Britain, including a
spotlight issue for closer</p>
<p>attention. These are:</p>
<p>1. Health inequalities</p>
<p>2. Obesity</p>
<p>3. Mental health</p>
<p>4. Social care and support</p>
<p>5. Spotlight: Healthcare for people with a learning disability</p>
<p>England, Wales and Scotland have different legislative, regulatory
and public policy</p>
<p>frameworks in place, all of which make provisions for protecting
rights relating to health</p>
<p>and care though not necessarily in the same way. However, the
Equality Act 2010 and</p>

<p>7. Justice and detention</p>
<p>This chapter examines the extent to which disabled people live in
security and liberty and are free from cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment. In particular, it looks at the experiences of
disabled people in detention, including in prison, police custody,
health and social care settings, and immigration detention. It reports
on how disabled people experience and perceive crime, particularly hate
crime, and explores how confident disabled people are in the criminal
justice system. It also looks at how disabled people are protected by
the law and if they are treated fairly.</p>
<p>Four indicators were chosen to assess how well disabled people’s
rights in relation to</p>
<p>security, liberty and freedom from abuse are protected in Britain.
These are:</p>
<p>1. Detention</p>
<p>2. Experience and perceptions of crime and the criminal justice
system</p>
<p>3. Disability hate crime</p>
<p>4. Legal aid</p>
<p>Justice and policing is a devolved matter in Scotland. Therefore,
process and outcome</p>
<p>evidence is reported separately for England and Wales and for
Scotland.</p>

<p>Data gaps</p>
<p>The ‘patchwork nature’ of hate crime legislation means that
disability hate incidents are not within the scope of ‘stirring up of
hatred offences’ in both England/<strong>Wales and in Scotland.</strong>
There are noticeable data gaps in the area of detention, including a
lack of reliable figures for prisoner suicide related to mental health,
and a lack of data available on the number of people who are detained in
a police cell in Scotland after being removed from a public place under
section 297 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act
2003. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has also made clear the need
for a comprehensive and up-to-date study of prisoner mental health in
England and Wales.</p>

<p>8. Participation and identity</p>
<p>This chapter is concerned with how disabled people realise their
rights to take control of their own lives, to make their own choices, to
develop their potential and have their needs fulfilled. This includes
how disabled people engage with political processes and participate in
democratic free and fair elections, and their capability to access
public services, transport, schools and leisure activities. It also
includes forming relationships and living an independent life free from
stigma.</p>
<p>Three specific indicators were chosen to assess how well the
rights</p>
<p>relating to participation and identity are protected in Britain.

<p>Data gaps</p>
<p>There is a lack of disability data on our elected representatives at
a national level: Members of Parliament, Members of the Scottish
Parliament and Welsh Assembly Members. There is also a lack of data
about members of the House of Lords. Surveys of local councillors are
carried out, but only every few years. There are no reliable statistics
on the media representation of disabled people. Measures of disability
prejudice have focused largely on disability as a general category.
There is a lack of evidence on how people’s attitudes towards disability
differ by disability type.</p>

<p>4. Following the Children and Families Act 2014, the ability of
children and young people</p>
<p>and their parents to be involved in discussions and decisions about
their individual support and local provision has been strengthened. The
creation of a more coordinated assessment process for those with SEN
and/or a disability was seen with the provision of a new 0-25 Education,

<p>16. The reporting of average spend was based on a small
self-selecting sample of 70</p>
<p>organisations, and it has been noted by the British Association for
Supported Employment (2014) that this could under-represent a picture of
significant disinvestment, based on its experience of a number of
services disappearing and many more having faced substantial
cutbacks.</p>
<p>17. If entitled to Employment and Support Allowance a person is
placed in one of two groups:</p>
<p>a support group or a work-related activity group (the latter is a
where a disability or health condition limits a person’s ability to
work, but where there are things that can be done to improve this).</p>

due to come into</p>
<p>force in April 2017. It will be collected across the whole of the UK.
All employers (public, private, charities and voluntary organisations)
with a pay bill of more than £3 million each year will pay the levy. The
levy rate is 0.5% of pay bill; there is an allowance of £15,000 per
year. The levy is paid to HM Revenue and Customs through the PAYE
process.</p>
<p>22. Section 1(2) of the 1998 Act provides that a person qualifies for
the National Minimum</p>
<p>Wage if they are an individual who: (a) is a worker; (b) is working,
or ordinarily works, in the UK under their contract; and (c) has ceased
to be of compulsory school age.</p>
<p>23. The current National Minimum Wage (NMW) for those under the age
of 25 still applies.</p>
<p>The NMW rates came into force on 1 October 2016: £7.20 per hour (age
25 and over); £6.95 per hour (age 21-24); £5.55 per hour (age 18-20); £4
per hour (age 16-17); £3.40 for apprentices (aged under 19, or 19 or
over who are in the first year of apprenticeship). The rate will change

<p><em>28. In</em> R (MM &amp; DM) v Secretary of State for Work and

<p>agreed that the DWP has to make adjustments for persons with a mental

<p>29. There are currently two forms of Employment and Support
Allowance, contributory for</p>
<p>those with sufficient National Insurance contributions, and
income-related which is means-tested. Income-related Employment and
Support Allowance will be replaced by Universal Credit. Following a Work
Capability Assessment, a claimant is either found fit for work in which
case they may apply for Jobseeker’s Allowance or Universal Credit, or
they are placed in the ‘Work-Related Activity Group’, or they are placed
in the ‘Support Group’. Only the latter group is not required to
undertake any work-related activity.</p>

that there was a</p>
<p>reduction between 2013 and 2014 in the proportion of assessments that
mentioned people with a learning disability (from 82% to 72%) (Baines
and Hatton, 2014). Moreover, three out of four Joint Strategic Needs
Assessments included no information on the number of children with
learning disabilities in their area, and 19 out of 20 gave no indication
of future prevalence. According to the review, analysis of the type of
information contained within Joint Strategic Needs Assessments suggested
that it was unlikely to be of value in planning future services.</p>

England where 61% of people access services within 28 days. See Scottish

<p>44. Note that the samples of disabled respondents numbered only 76 in
2009 and 2010, and</p>

<p>Impairment type categories</p>
<p>Wherever possible, the data tables include disaggregation of disabled
people by impairment type and the preferred classification for this is
the Government Statistical Service (GSS) harmonised question for
impairment. This classifies all people with a long-lasting physical or
mental health conditions or illnesses into one or more of the following
categories (see right-hand column in the table below). Note that
multiple responses are usually possible.</p>

the data tables</p>

climbing stairs)</p>
<p>Dexterity 4. Dexterity (for example, lifting and carrying objects,

<p>Further information on GSS harmonised principles relating to
disability and impairment can be found in ONS (2015).</p>
<p>Not all surveys include the harmonised question, however other
classifications are available in some surveys. Where an alternative
classification is available, the categories have as far as possible been
mapped onto categories similar to those in the harmonised question. The
following tables show these mappings.</p>

<p>Appendix C</p>
<p>Intersectional analysis methodology</p>
<p>The intersectional analysis draws on the most recent year’s data and
uses disability and other characteristics to investigate how disability
interacts with other factors when predicting outcomes.</p>
<p>The other characteristics used are based on six of the other eight
protected characteristics listed by the Equality Act 2010: age, race or
ethnicity, religion or belief, marital status, sex and sexual
orientation. In addition, other variables that may have been of interest
for a particular outcome were also included such as region or
socio-economic status.</p>
<p>A list of explanatory variables to be considered for inclusion was
drawn up for each outcome. Those that were unavailable for a particular
survey, or had a high percentage of missing cases (more than 5%), were
dropped from the analysis. Logistic regression was used when the outcome
variable was binary (for example, whether someone is overweight/obese or
not). Linear regression was used when the outcome was an amount or value
(for example, the median pay gap). For binary outcomes, the output from
the model is in the form of odds ratios. An odds ratio is a measure of
association between a factor or characteristic, such as disability, and
an outcome. The odds ratio represents the odds that an outcome will
occur given a particular factor or characteristic, compared to the odds
of the outcome occurring in the absence of that factor. For each
characteristic in the model there is a ‘reference group’ (for example,
people aged 16-24) which always has an odds ratio of one. If another
group (such as people aged 55-59 years) has an odds ratio higher than
one, this means that people in this group are more likely to experience
the outcome than those in the reference group.</p>
<p>For continuous outcomes, the output from the model is in the form of
coefficients which indicate the marginal effect of each factor or
characteristics on the outcome holding all other factors at their means.
For each outcome measure, two models were analysed: • A basic regression
model, including the equality characteristics of age, gender and</p>
<p>disability as explanatory variables, plus other characteristics of
interest (added to the</p>
<p>model in a step-wise manner, with only the resulting model
shown).</p>
<p>• A final model including interaction terms between disability and
each of the other</p>
<p>characteristics, for example, between disability and age.</p>
