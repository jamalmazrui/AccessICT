What are Screen Readers
Screen readers are a form of assistive technology (AT) software that enables access to a computer, and all the things a computer does, by attempting to identify and interpret what is being displayed on the computer screen using text-to-speech. Screen readers can only access and process live text (fully editable or selectable text).
• Provides access to someone who is visually impaired, mobility or has a learning disability to access text on the screen.
• Offers same level of independence and privacy as anyone else.

Screen reader program for Microsoft Windows that allows blind and visually impaired users to read the screen either with a text-to-speech output or by a refreshable Braille display. NVDA screen reader can be downloaded free of charge by anyone.

How Do Screen Readers Work?
• Screen readers read line-by-line from left-to-right and top-to-bottom. 
• Screen readers start at the top of a document or website and read any text including alternative text for images, graphics or charts. 
• Screen readers navigate a document or website using the keyboard without a mouse. Tab key: jump from link to link, Enter: select a link, arrow keys: navigate a document or website.
• Reading order is important for users with visual challenges. The users can become confused if the document (content, tables, images or charts) is poorly organized or out of order.
Click vs Select
Screen readers and physical or mobility limitation users navigate a document or website using the keyboard without a mouse. The word "Click" is not inclusive of people who can't use the mouse. Use the word "Select" to write step-by-step instructions.

"Click" or "Click on" Example
• Go to YouTube video player
• Click on Settings gear icon
• Click on Subtitles/CC
• Click on Options to Customize
• Click on Caption Style
Use "Select" Example (Recommend)
• Go to YouTube video player
• Select Settings gear icon
• Select Subtitles/CC
• Select Options to Customize
• Select Caption Style

Captioning Videos
Per federal and state law, and CSU policy, instructional media (e.g., videos, captured lectures, recorded presentations) must have captions. 
This includes instructional media used in classrooms, posted on websites or shared in Canvas.
• All students who are enrolled in a course must be able to access the content in the course.
• Faculty: Funding is available to help faculty generate captions and transcripts for instructional media. Materials should be submitted at least six weeks in advance of their use in instruction.
• Staff: For CSUN staff who do not provide classroom material, there is a cost through chargeback. For information on the chargeback, email ncod@csun.edu. csun.edu/captioning
Digital Accessibility Content Analogy

Organize content with headings, subheadings, images, videos, and footer are important for usability and accessibility.
Microsoft Word 97 - 2003
If you encounter [Compatibility Mode] and unable to use Go to File Tab, select Convert button, Word Accessibility Checker, that's because older version and Save. Word 2016 or Office 365 like Microsoft Word 97-2003 don't have Accessibility has Accessibility Checker features. 
Checker features available. 	Run Accessibility Checker again.

All CSUN faculty, staff, and students can install the Microsoft Office 365 on up to five personal devices for FREE.
• Faculty and staff https://www.csun.edu/it/download-office • Students: https://www.csun.edu/it/students
• Divide large blocks of text into smaller sections
• Avoid overly complex sentences
• Provide adequate whitespace
• Use line or paragraph spacing (avoid Enter/Return for 
"blank" space)
• Avoid underlining text. Underlining is interpreted by screen readers and people with low vision as linked text. 
• Font size between 12 to 18 point
• San-serif fonts are more suited to electronic formats (Arial, Calibri, Verdana or Franklin Gothic Book)
• Capitalization for the heading is fine not the entire paragraph. Most people have difficult to read it if all text capitalized.
Mysterious Dash or Hyphen
Screen readers do not know what the - symbol represents (minus, hyphen, en dash or em dash) so screen readers will not read it. It is always a good practice to spell the word and any abbreviations or make a reference to your abbreviation when used for the first time.
For examples:
• May 8th, 2022 from 3:30 - 5:00pm. The screen reader reads three, thirty five. Recommend May 8th, 2022 from 3:30 to 5:00pm.
• Final exams May 14 - 20, 2022, screen reader reads May 1420, 2022. Recommend May 14 to 20, 2022.
• Homework assignment pages 200 - 281 for tonight's reading material. Recommend pages 200 to 281. 
• The fiscal year 2015-2016. Recommend The fiscal year from 2015 to 2016.
• Grading scale 95 - 100%, screen reader reads 95100%. Recommend 95 to 100%. 
❖A + , screen reader reads A+. Recommend A plus.
❖A - , screen reader reads A. Recommend A minus.
❖Recommend to spell the word plus or minus for consistency purpose.
It's okay to use dash between compound words, i.e., well-known author, well-being, in-service, in-person, runner-up, part-time job, co-author, re-elect, long-term project, state-of-the-art technology, etc.

Direct vs Styles Formatting

Direct Formatting
• Not accessible to any assistive technology such as screen readers
• Can't create a Table of Contents
• Can't create a navigation to different sections in a document
• Huge barriers!
Styles Pane Formatting
• Provide structure and make document accessible
• Easier to modify existing formatting
• Create and update a Table of Contents
• Quicker navigation to different sections in a document
• Retain document structure when export to PDF
• Accessible to any assistive technology like screen readers
• Save time and save lives!

Heading Styles
Heading Styles (Heading 1 through Heading 6) in a logical sequence. Do not skip heading levels i.e. Heading 2 to Heading 4, headings should be in order.)
• Heading 1: Document title or main content heading/title (just one time only). Font size i.e. 20pt - 18pt.
Headings are styles to give a document structure by category or topic. 
Without headings, a person using assistive technology like a screen reader cannot navigate by sections, subsections, or scan section titles to understand the document structure. • Heading 2: Major section heading. Font size 18pt - 16pt.
• Heading 3: Sub-section of the Heading 2. Font size 16pt - 14pt
• Heading 4: Sub-section of the Heading 3, and so on, ending with Heading 6. Font size 14pt - 12pt.
• Normal: Text or Paragraph. Font size 12pt or up.
• Title in Word Style won't recognize when converting to a PDF. Start with Heading 1 for the document title.
Heading and Paragraph
Avoid making the heading style and paragraph in one section because it would cause the Table of Contents 

Make sure the heading style is listed on a single line and add the main content below the heading style in a normal paragraph.

Columns
• If you want to make columns, format them as columns. Screen readers can read the content organized in columns.
• Do not put text on one line and use several tab stops to move it over. Screen readers will read it one line a time, not as columns. 

Text Boxes are Inaccessible

Use Page Break
Screen readers can read blank characters as 
"Blank". This can be very irritating, especially if 
Word automatically adds a break at the end of each page. You can also insert a manual page break anytime you want to start a new page in your document.
• Put your cursor where you want one page to end and the next to begin
• Go to Insert > Page Break

Ruler Tab Marker
To create three columns in one line, set ruler tab marker as shown.
1. Select paragraph marks "Show/hide"
2. View tab then select Ruler
3. Remove extra white spaces, tabs, and spacebars
4. Highlight selected text
5. Set ruler tab marker position at 2" for second column and 4" for third column
Paragraph or Line Spacing
• Avoid creating blank lines to create spaces between text. 
• Use line or paragraph space to increase or decrease the amount of space between headings and paragraphs.
• Heading levels space between a heading and the previous section's body text.
Paragraph Spacing
• On Styles Panel, select Heading 2 and right-click to select Modify

• Headings structure will automatically populate a table of contents and provide accessible for screen readers rely on headings structure to navigate a page quickly. 
• Adding Table of Contents to any documents or syllabus over 8 pages to make it easier for readers to go directly to a specific section in the document.

Image Alternative or Alt Text• The purpose of Alt Text is to allow low vision or blind users who use text-to-speech assistive technologies (AT), such as screen readers, to understand the purpose of graphic images. Sighted users usually don't see alt text unless they use AT.
• Screen readers and other AT can't convert images into texts. So, when writing alt text, consider the following for images:o Describe the content and the purpose of the image clearly and concisely, in a phrase or a sentence or two. Keep alt text short 200 characters or less. o Image with text (for example, the CSUN wordmark) should include the words on the image. 
o "Image of...", "Photo of..." is not needed because screen readers and other AT announce that it's an "image" or "graphic".
Screen readers and other AT announce that it's an "image" or "graphic",  then read the alt text: "Three plants going through transformation with text quote Accessibility user-friendly document for CSUN student success."oWhen completing the alt text, use proper punctuation such as periods to indicate the end of the alt text. Without proper punctuation, some screen readers will run the alt text into the body text that follows and cause confusion to the user.oDon't insert hyperlinks in alt text because they are not clickable and can't create descriptive link text.  A stair chase leading up to an entryway is painted yellow with bold black text that reads museums are now.A hand reaches out of a computer screen giving the hand gesture for stop. The screen reads 'access denied!'On the left is the book cover for Haben The Deafblind

What are Decorative Images?
• Conveys no information; does not provide meaningful information.
• Purely for visual effect.
• The horizontal line that divided the two sections.
• Line border image used as part of page design.
• Decorative images do not require a text alternative.
• Decorative images, lines, borders, or shapes ignore by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

Image Captions
• Captions are universal and accessible for everyone.
• Captions are read and visible to all users whether they use assistive technologies (AT) or not. 
• Captions and alt text have different purposes. 
• Captions convey what's visible in the image. 
• Alt text describes the visual aspect of the image and should be brief. 
• If captions and alt text are similar in their descriptions, alt text can be "Mark as decorative" to be ignored by the screen readers.
• Don't repeat the image's caption as the alt text. People don't need to hear the same information twice.

Tips for Creating Accessible TablesUse Word's built-in to create Tables
• Create tables by inserting them. Avoid creating tables by drawing boxes and lines or by using tabs and spaces. Screen readers have difficulty understanding tables with odd cell sizes.
• Simple Data Tables only. 
• Tables have a logical reading order from left to right, top to bottom.
• Tables are labeled with alternative text.
• Provide Title (i.e. Caption) and Summary before the Table.
• Use Table Tools editor to identify the different types of rows and columns such as Header Row and First Column.
Keep your table simple
• Simple tables are easier to interpret for all students and screen readers.
• Avoid merging cells, split cells, no blank cells, as well as tables nested within a cell. 
• Use tables to organize data not format information. Never use table for layout.
• The complex a table (merging cells, nesting multiple headings under one, adding blank lines, etc.) the worse it will be for accessibility.
• Sample of Simple Tables vs. Complex Tables by Penn State.

Accessible grading scale in table vs non-table format
	Non-table format	Table format
A plus = 1000 to 970 points
A = 969 to 940 points
A minus = 939 to 900 points
B plus = 899 to 870 points
B = 869 to 840 points
B minus = 839 to 800 points
C plus = 799 to 770 points
C = 769 to 740 points
C minus = 739 to 700 points
D plus = 699 to 670 points
D = 669 to 512 points
D minus = 639 to 600 points
F = 599 points or lowerDifferent screen readers may read texts differently. The "+/-" may not be read out loud. Screen readers will read + symbol for plus but not - symbol. Screen readers do not know whether - symbol is minus, hyphen, dash, en dash or em dash. It is always a good practice to spell them out and spell out any abbreviations or make a reference to your abbreviation when used for the first time. Visit Screen Readers: A Guide to Punctuation and Typographic Symbols.


Step 2: Select Table Header Row
A table header row contains column headings that provide context and aid navigation of the table. People who can't see the table can have column headings read aloud.

Step 3: Repeat Header Rows
• Highlight the first row	When inserting a table at the bottom of a page 
• Layout tab then select Repeat 	in Word, the table break across two pages show 
	Header Rows	two repeating header rows as example

Step 4: Table - Insert Caption
Adding a caption or summary of your table is universal and accessible for everyone
• Select the table, then right-click to select Insert Caption or 
• Go to References tab, then select Insert Caption
• In the popup window, type the title of the table in the Caption textbox
• In the Label textbox, select Table
• Position textbox, select Above selected item then select OK 
Alternative way without using Table 
(no header row)
To create three columns in 1 line, set Tab Stops (see previous slide):
1. View tab then select Ruler
2. Select text to create tabs
3. Open Paragraph dialog
4. In the lower left of the Paragraph dialog is the button for Tabs
5. Clear All existing Tab Stops for the selected text
6. Set new Tab Stops
Avoid multiple tabs key, space bar, and blank lines, someone with assistive technology like screen readers will listen excess spaces and lines.
