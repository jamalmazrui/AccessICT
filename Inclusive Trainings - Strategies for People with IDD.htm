<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Intellectual and developmental disabilities are
disabilities which impact someone’s ability to learn, process information, and
adapt to their environment. Some examples of intellectual and developmental
disabilities include Down Syndrome, autism, and fetal alcohol syndrome. People
with intellectual and developmental disabilities learn, think, make decisions,
and are powerful advocates when given the right tools. In this paper, we will
use “intellectual disabilities” when talking about people whose disabilities
affect their adaptive skills and measured IQ, “autism” when talking about
autism specifically, and “intellectual and developmental disabilities” or
“I/DD” when talking broadly about people with these kinds of disabilities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Historically, people with I/DD have been warehoused in
institutions, and there is often a false assumption that we cannot speak for
ourselves or be involved in advocacy and community organizing. The idea that we
aren’t able to make decisions about our own lives, such as where to live,
contributed to this systemic institutionalization. This is why selfadvocacy,
the ability of people with disabilities to speak for ourselves in order to have
control over our own lives, is such an important skill in the disability
community. One way that self-advocacy is taught is through leadership and
community organizing trainings, where individuals can learn about the societal
problems facing their communities and gain strategies on how to address these
systemic issues. This paper is intended to address some of the common barriers to
our participation in these trainings, and change the way organizers think about
people with I/DD.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.45pt;margin-bottom:
6.7pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>The Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) is a
501(c)(3) nonprofit organization run by and for autistic people. ASAN was
created to serve as a national grassroots disability rights organization for
the autistic community, advocating for systems change and ensuring that the
voices of autistic people are heard in policy debates and the halls of power.
We work to empower autistic people across the world to take control of our own
lives and the future of our common community. Our activities include public
policy advocacy, the development of Autistic cultural activities, and
leadership trainings for autistic self-advocates. We provide information about
autism, disability rights, and systems change to the public through a number of
different educational, cultural, and advocacy related projects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:8.15pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>A major component of ASAN’s work is developing the
leadership and advocacy skills of individuals with I/DD. For the past 6 years,
we have organized the Autism Campus Inclusion (ACI) Summer Leadership Academy,
a weeklong training in Washington, DC for autistic college students who are
interested in making their campuses and communities more accessible and
inclusive to disabled people. Participants build their skills and expertise in
disability history and policy, coalition-building, and community and campus organizing.
Following their Leadership Academy experience, ACI alumni are provided with
extensive mentoring and technical assistance in support of their work to
advocate for systems change on their campuses and to address barriers to
community inclusion in higher education faced by autistic students. </p>

style='font-size:9.5pt;color:#9084B4'>The Autistic Self Advocacy Network seeks
to advance the principles of the disability rights movement with regard to
autism. ASAN believes that the goal of autism advocacy should be a world in
which autistic people enjoy equal access, rights, and opportunities. We work to
empower autistic people across the world to take control of our own lives and
the future of our common community, and seek to organize the autistic community
to ensure our voices are heard in the national conversation about us. Nothing About

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:7.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>In addition to ACI, ASAN has conducted
state-based leadership trainings for adults with I/DD. As a part of the Pacific
Alliance on Disability Self Advocacy (PADSA) project, ASAN organized the
Pacific Leadership Academy from 2014 to 2016 for self-advocates in California,
Oregon, Montana, and Washington. These academies helped participants connect
with others from their state, develop advocacy skills such as fundraising and
conducting meetings, and develop an action plan to meet relevant goals for the
disability community in their state. An additional academy which took place in
2014 and 2015, the Tennessee Employment First academy, prepared self-advocates
to advocate for Employment First and for home and community-based services
(HCBS) in the state of Tennessee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:7.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>We know from history that people with I/DD
can be powerful organizers when given the right tools. The self-advocacy
movement of the 80’s and 90’s made significant progress in advancing the rights
of people with intellectual disabilities. During this time period, people with
disabilities played a critical role in shutting down many institutions that
held people with I/DD in deplorable conditions. Disabled self-advocates helped
shape the language people use to refer to people with intellectual disabilities
to be more inclusive; we also helped increase the lifespan of people with I/DD
by placing more focus on our health care needs, and through
deinstitutionalization itself. With the right supports, people with
intellectual and developmental disabilities have changed our own lives—and the
world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Our own experience creating trainings of this nature shows
the positive effects they have on participants and their communities. Alumni of
our programs have begun campus disability rights organizations, served in
student government, helped to found disability cultural centers, worked in
disability policy, and played a role in expanding accessibility and opportunity
for people with disabilities. In addition, participants spoke to the valuable
skills they have developed which can be brought to higher education,
employment, and other opportunities. As one ACI participant said, “A lot of the
things I wanted to accomplish felt too big for me, but now they feel more
manageable.” Overall, participants of all of our academies demonstrated an
increase in their confidence for managing their own supports, holding paid
employment, and affecting public policies as a result of the training. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>ASAN believes that more trainings like this are necessary
to give disabled people the skills we need to advocate for accessibility and
inclusivity in our communities. Historically, movements to improve societal
conditions for people with I/DD have been led by non-disabled facilitators.
While having non-disabled allies can be beneficial to the strength of the disability
rights movement, there are also notable pitfalls to relying on these
facilitators. One important consideration is that when a non-disabled person is
leading a community organizing group comprised mostly of disabled people, the
non-disabled facilitator can control the goals and actions of the group as a
whole. This can leave disabled participants feeling as if they cannot advocate
for the issues they care about, and can lead to disengagement from advocacy.
This issue has led to the stagnation of many disability advocacy organizations
over the years, and the need for self-advocates to be supported to organize
ourselves is more important than ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:20.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>From education, to employment, to healthcare, there are a
multitude of societal issues facing people with disabilities, and our voices
are important to the wider conversation on how to address these issues. In
addition to creating more trainings that focus specifically on disability, it
is imperative that current community organizing trainings, events, and conferences
more broadly are made accessible to people with intellectual and developmental
disabilities. When disabled people are not included in community organizing
opportunities such as these, non-disabled people don’t get the chance to learn
from the critical perspectives and unique lived experiences of the disabled
community, and disabled people don’t receive the tools that we need to turn
that experience into effective organizing. The purpose of this white paper is to
share the insights we have learned through organizing leadership and community
organizing programming for the intellectual and developmentally disabled
community in order to encourage the adoption of these techniques for other organization’s
similar efforts, whether specific to the disability community or not. </p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Barriers of inaccessible trainings</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1in;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><span style='font-family:

src="Inclusive%20Trainings%20-%20Strategies%20for%20People%20with%20IDD_files/image001.gif"></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:4.4pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Accessibility means that people with disabilities can
attend and fully participate in a given opportunity. When places and spaces are
inaccessible, disabled people are unable to take advantage of the same
opportunities as non-disabled people. For example, if an event takes place on
the third floor of a building without an elevator, people with certain physical
disabilities would not be able to get up the stairs to attend. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Many accessibility issues go unaddressed because of
ableism, which is systemic discrimination or prejudice against disabled people.
While individuals may be unaware of their own ableist behavior, these attitudes
lead to structural oppression against people with disabilities. For example, a
common ableist belief is that if an individual needs an accommodation in order
to succeed in a given setting (such as needing extra time on an exam at
college), then this person is getting an unfair advantage over other individuals.
On a systemic level, these attitudes can lead to lack of accommodations in
educational and occupational settings, leaving disabled people with less
opportunities for education and employment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:7.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>While this paper will focus specifically
on barriers to leadership programming for people with intellectual and
developmental disabilities, there are also more general barriers that can
affect the participation of all people with disabilities in a variety of
community organizing contexts. In order to ensure your program is accessible
and inclusive, you must address these barriers as well. For more information
about these barriers, please read the resource on accessible event planning
located at <u><span style='color:#405789'>https://pacific-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Accessible-Event-Planning.

yourself with the common characteristics of autistic people, as well as people
with I/ DD. You can find out more about autism by going to <u><span

margin-left:-.75pt;text-indent:22.5pt'>&#492;  Local chapters of self-advocacy
organizations such as People First and family organizations such as The Arc. There
are many roadblocks that make traditional leadership programming inaccessible
or non-inclusive of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
These barriers are important to address regardless of the skill level of the
training. Disabled people are much less likely to be included in more advanced
trainings because introductorylevel trainings are inaccessible to us. However,
disabled people have the same access needs even if we do make it to an
advanced-level training, because the skill level of a program does not
correlate to the amount of accommodation needed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.15pt;margin-bottom:
7.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>To illustrate the barriers of
inaccessible trainings, it is important to understand what circumstances people
with I/ DD may have trouble with. Some of these difficulties apply specifically
to autistic people, while others can apply more broadly to most individuals
with I/DD. Every person with a disability is different; not every person with
I/DD will have difficulty with all of these things, and for some individuals,
we may actually have strengths in some of these areas. Still, using these
indicators, we can go into greater detail about aspects of community organizing
trainings that may be inaccessible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black'>         </span>&#492;     Loud

108%;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Autistic people can be sensitive to a variety of external
stimuli, such as noises, certain sights/brightness, smells, and sudden
movements. It can be difficult for us to process these stimuli. Some common
stimuli that can cause access issues at events such as leadership trainings are
microphone feedback; bright, fluorescent, or flashing lights; perfume/body
sprays; the sound of people eating; sirens/alarms; and loud music. If an
autistic person encounters one of these situations, it could cause sensory
overload, leaving us unable to participate in the rest of an event.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Many people with I/DD work best with an established routine or
structure to our day. Having a routine enables us to understand what is going
on and process new information, and it can be distressing and confusing if we
do not know what will happen next. This can make events that do not have a set
schedule, or events that change their schedule at short notice, inaccessible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span

font-family:"Arial",sans-serif'>•<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Autistic people tend to take things literally, and may have
trouble with abstract language, such as sarcasm and metaphor. In addition,
people with intellectual disabilities may not understand language that is too technical
or complex. Presentations or leadership academy applications/materials that use
jargon or vague ideas to present information can be difficult to understand.</p>

</span></span>People with I/DD may need time to plan out what we are going to
say when given a verbal prompt. It can take some time to process what is being
said to us, as well as to verbally formulate a response. Activities that put a
person “on the spot” by calling them out to respond can be overwhelming for an
autistic person, who may be unable to respond at all. In addition, some
autistic people use technology to communicate instead of speech; some of these
technologies can take a long time to put together sentences.</p>

</span></span>People with I/DD may have trouble initiating movement if not
given time to plan in advance, and can have difficulty with coordination. Even
something like getting up out of a chair can be difficult at times. Activities
that require an autistic person to move (such as exercise), or that don’t give
an autistic person time to plan out their movement (such as a sudden shift to
another room/area for an activity) can be inaccessible.</p>

</span></span>Autistic people can have difficulty interpreting nonverbal cues.
This can make it difficult to follow directions that aren’t explicitly stated,
or to connect with other participants in a leadership program. Eye contact can
also be distressing or confusing to an autistic person. When community
organizing programs don’t communicate that these differences are acceptable and
should be celebrated as a form of diversity, it can be easy for autistic
participants to feel disconnected from the rest of the group or ashamed for not
“getting with the program”.</p>

</span></span>Intellectually and developmentally disabled people need frequent
breaks from scheduled programming to decompress and process what is going on.
Trainings that are “intensive” (go for hours without breaks, or do not allow
breaks), or trainings that last for multiple days/weeks without scheduled time
off, can keep these populations from attending.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.25pt;margin-bottom:
7.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>Sometimes, you may encounter
situations where people have conflicting access needs relating to their
disability. For example, one autistic person may be sensitive to loud noises,
while another may speak loudly and have difficulty controlling the volume of
their voice. Or there may be one disabled person who doesn’t work well in small
groups, while another doesn’t work well in large groups. Being flexible and
individualizing your approach to accessibility is crucial to address the needs
of all participants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:17.8pt;margin-bottom:
21.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>As you can see, it can be very easy
for many community organizing and leadership development programs to fall into
patterns that keep people with I/DD from participating, or from fully engaging
with a program even if they do participate. However, this does not have to be
the case. There are many modifications that can be made to ensure full accessibility
and inclusion, as we will discuss below.</p>

<h1 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>How to do an accessible training</h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:.1in;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:107%'><span style='font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:11.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The logistical considerations that go into any
community-organizing event are vast; for ease of use, we have separated this
section into common components of these events.   </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Establishing goals</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Before you even start organizing the logistics of your
training, it is important to think about the goals for the training. What
skills or knowledge do you want participants to leave with? There may be
instances where you have planned an activity that may be inaccessible to people
with intellectual or developmental disabilities, but thinking of the goal of
each activity can help you restructure the activity to become more accessible. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:11.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>For example, one early goal of the training may be for your
participants to get to know each other better. Many conferences use icebreaker
exercises to do this, but some of these exercises may be difficult for people
with intellectual and developmental disabilities who have trouble coming up
with verbal language spontaneously. A more accessible option may be to give
participants a list of questions beforehand (such as “What is your name, where
are you from, and what do you hope to learn from this training?”), so that
participants can still learn about each other, but the participants that need
time to process their answer can still fully participate.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Application/interview process</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:7.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>Consider the selection process that you
use to determine participants in your program. Are participants selected through
nomination, or do they fill out an application? Is there an interview component
to the selection process? How do you do outreach to find potential
participants?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:7.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>The recruitment process for participants
can often inadvertently exclude people with intellectual and developmental
disabilities. For example, someone organizing an event focused on racial
justice may not think to reach out to disability organizations, but doing so
might help them recruit disabled people of color who would want to participate
and wouldn’t otherwise find out about the event. In addition, recruitment
materials that contain jargon may discourage disabled potential applicants from
applying, as they may not understand the goals of the event and how it pertains
to their own goals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Consider reaching out to local and national disability
advocacy organizations to advertise your opportunities, including (but not
limited to):</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:4.4pt;
margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-.25in'>&#492; Your state’s Developmental
Disabilities Council and Protection and Advocacy agency (if your event is
statebased)</p>

"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black'>         </span>&#492;    Local chapters of
self-advocacy organizations such as People First and family organizations such
as The Arc.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Financial Considerations</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.55pt;margin-bottom:
7.1pt;margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>Even if your application and
interview process leads to more individuals with I/DD being admitted into your
program, financial barriers may keep these individuals from attending your
program. People with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty, and may
have additional concerns related to how receiving financial assistance to
attend leadership programming may affect our disability benefits. These
circumstances need to be taken into account in order to ensure that all the
individuals admitted into your program get the chance to participate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:7.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>If possible, all costs of a training
should be covered for all participants. This includes travel, housing, meals,
all costs of support person’s attendance/other accommodations, and any other
applicable mandatory costs. If this is not possible, another option is to offer
scholarships for participants in financial need in order to cover these costs.
It should be made clear in all application materials that these scholarships
are available, or that the opportunity is all-expenses paid, in order to
encourage applicants who may have refrained from applying due to financial
stressors. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:11.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Whenever possible, costs associated with a training should
be paid to participants up-front instead of through reimbursement. For example,
participants should receive a stipend for meals at the beginning of the
program, instead of paying for their own meals and being paid back afterwards.
Participants with I/DD may not have money readily available for these expenses,
or may need this money for other costs associated with their disability, so
they may be unable to wait for a reimbursement.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Upon Acceptance</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:4.5pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Once accepted into your program, there are two important
documents that should be made available to participants. An orientation or
“welcome” packet is necessary to help participants know what to expect from the
training. This packet should contain the following information:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black'>         </span>&#492;     A

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:10.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>At the same time as you distribute orientation materials,
it is also imperative that you obtain information about disability
accommodations needed by each participant. This gives you ample time to arrange
any accommodations. The most efficient way to collect this information is
through having each participant fill out an accommodations packet. This can
also serve as a method of collecting other important information about a
participant. Here are common questions for an accommodations packet to ask:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.7pt;

margin-left:-.25pt'>Providing this list demonstrates that you take
accommodations seriously and are willing to provide them. If you do not provide
these materials beforehand, participants may not indicate that they need
accommodations to fully participate in your training, which will result in
inadvertent inaccessibility.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Schedule </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>As mentioned previously, how the schedule of a program is
structured can affect the participation of people with disabilities. One of the
first considerations of a programming schedule is transportation of students to
and from the venue. For trainings that take place over multiple days that
require participants to stay overnight, or otherwise require participants to
travel a long distance to the venue, it is important to build a “cushion” into
the schedule to account for travel time; that is, there should be little to no
scheduled programming on the arrival and departure days of the training. One
reason for this is that if there are any unexpected delays or cancellations of
travel arrangements, participants do not miss out on any programming. The other
reason is that travelling can be very exhausting for people with disabilities, who
are often dealing with unfamiliar, overwhelming and inaccessible environments.
At the same time, once we arrive at the venue, we need to take some time to
orient to our new surroundings. Providing this extra time can help ensure that
people with I/DD have the space we need to avoid sensory overload and fully
participate in the training.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:7.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>For trainings that require participants to
travel out-of-state (by plane, train, or bus), organizers should help
participants arrange their travel (including the travel of their support
person, if applicable). This should be done well in advance of the training (no
later than 1 month before). Some participants with I/DD may not have traveled
using public transportation before, so having someone to facilitate that
process makes it more accessible. In addition, participants who travel with a
support person often need more lead time in order to coordinate their support
person’s schedule. Organizers should create a document for each participant
with the following information:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.65pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:108%'><span style='font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black'>         </span>&#492;     Location of the
airport or bus/train station where the participant will be leaving from.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.65pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:108%'><span style='font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black'>         </span>&#492;       Departure time
of the train/plane/bus, along with any confirmation number or terminal/gate
number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.65pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:108%'><span style='font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black'>         </span>&#492;     Name of the
airport or bus/train station where the participant will arrive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:5.95pt;margin-bottom:
4.4pt;margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-.25in'>&#492;    Directions on how to get
to the event venue from the arrival location (is there a shuttle to the venue?
If so, attach directions on how to get to the shuttle. Will a representative
from your organization be there to pick the participant up? If so, attaching a
photo of the member of your organization could help the participant find them.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>For participants for whom this information would be
helpful, there are also Social Stories available online for the process of
traveling by plane or train. Social Stories are a tool that autistic people can
use so they know what to expect from a new experience. These tools can be
useful for alleviating anxiety that autistic people might experience from being
in an unpredictable situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The other important consideration relating to event
scheduling is the length of each programming day or activity. Having a day or
presentation that is too long can lead to burnout for people with intellectual
or developmental disabilities. To ensure full engagement of all participants,
we recommend having no more than 6 hours of programming per day. In addition,
regularly scheduled breaks are important for giving disabled participants time
to process the material and decompress. We have found a structure of 10 minutes
of break time per 1 hour of programming to be effective in keeping participants
engaged and able to participate fully (6 hours of programming, 1 hour of
breaks, plus a 1-hour lunch break makes a full programming day of 8 hours).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:4.4pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>It is also important to note that lunch or dinner sessions
that involve having discussions or special guests do not count as a “break”.
Even if there is food being served, being required to stay in a specific space
and continue engaging with others can take the same amount of energy from a
disabled person as a traditional programming session. If you do need to have a
lunch/dinner session, treat this time as part of your general programming
schedule, and build in additional breaks to the day as needed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Schedules such as the ones we have outlined that include
frequent breaks and shorter programming periods can seem unnecessary to people
without disabilities, or even a sign that the person with a disability isn’t
motivated to engage in the training. We want to be absolutely clear that
modified schedules are not luxuries; they are necessary accommodations for
people with disabilities to participate in trainings, and are every bit as
critical as ASL interpretation for Deaf participants or braille materials for
Blind participants. People with intellectual and developmental disabilities
have the same right as all other participants to participate fully in all
aspects of trainings, and we cannot participate fully if we are asked to work
at the same pace as non-disabled people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:11.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Lastly, consider how many days of programming you need to
meet the goals of your training. If you need more than one week, it may be
helpful to break up your programming into smaller chunks, as having many days
of programming in a row can also cause burnout in disabled people. One model
that has been successful is to have programming on weekends over the course of
a month or two months. This can also allow participants to get concrete,
hands-on practice with the concepts they are learning in real life, which is an
important part of learning for people with I/DD. If a program takes place over
2 weeks or more, there should be at least one scheduled day off from
programming at the end of each week.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Materials </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Any written materials distributed to your participants
should be available in plain language. Writing in plain language keeps your
information understandable for people with intellectual disabilities.

margin-left:-.25pt'>Once your program has begun, there are a number of
materials that participants should receive upon their arrival. A copy of all
presentation materials (powerpoints, handouts, etc) should be compiled in a
booklet so that participants can follow along, as well as review these
materials before each presentation if this will be helpful to them. This
booklet also gives space for participants to take notes. You should also
provide an additional copy of the orientation packet at this time, which should
contain the finalized event schedule. These materials should be made available
in both physical and electronic formats (and the electronic format should be
accessible for screen-reading software).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In addition to these materials, participants should receive
name tags (which include their preferred gender pronouns) and color
communication badges. Name tags are important since some disabled people can
have trouble remembering names and pronouns, or recognizing faces. Participants
should be instructed to wear their name tags at all times.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:4.65pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>Color Communication Badges are a system
which were first developed in Autistic spaces and conferences, and usually come
in the form of a name tag holder that can pin or clip onto clothing. In the
name tag holder there are three cards: one green card that says “GREEN”, one
yellow card that says “YELLOW”, and one red card that says “RED.” The card that
is currently visible is the active card; the other two are hidden behind the
first one, accessible to the person if they should need them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Showing a green badge means that the person is actively
seeking communication; they have trouble initiating conversations, but want to
be approached by people who are interested in talking. Showing a yellow badge
means that the person only wants to talk to people they recognize and have
established beforehand can talk to them while they are “on yellow”. Showing a
red badge means that the person does not want to talk to anyone, and should not
be talked to unless there is an emergency. For more information about how color
communication badges work, please visit <u><span style='color:#405789'>http://
autisticadvocacy.org/2014/02/color-communication-badges/</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Color communication badges aid individuals because they
allow people to express their current communication preference quickly,
nonverbally, and simply - they can change what card is showing if their
preference changes. They are a good way to prevent circumstances where someone
is caught in a social situation they do not want to be in, or situations where
someone wants to talk but can’t initiate. In addition, communication badges can
serve as an important access tool as they allow participants to regulate the
amount of social interaction they engage in. For autistic people, for whom
social interactions can require a lot of energy, they can save this energy to
be used for other necessary activities, like engaging in presentations they may
have had to miss out on otherwise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:11.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Participants should not be required to wear color
communication badges, but they can be a helpful tool for some participants and
should be made available to everyone. You can explain the purpose of these
badges to each participant as they receive them, or do so during any general
orientation session.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Presentations</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.7pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>As mentioned previously, all presentations should be made
using plain language. It is also helpful to create a glossary with definitions
of any key terms used throughout each presentation, if participants are
expected to learn new vocabulary. One other important accommodation for
disabled participants is access to a note-taker, who can keep track of the
details of a presentation. The most effective way we have found to organize
note-taking is to assign a staff member as a designated note-taker for each
session, and then have this staff member email all participants with a copy of
the notes at the end of the presentation. Make sure that your assigned
note-taker is able to take notes in plain language.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The way a presentation is conducted can make all the
difference in whether or not participants with an intellectual or developmental
disability feels included. While having interactive components to a
presentation is important to keeping participants engaged, presentations that
force participants to move around, make eye contact with or touch others, or
spontaneously talk or share how they are feeling can be inaccessible to us.
However, there are ways to work around these barriers to make sure your
presentations are accessible while achieving the same goals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The best way to make a presentation accessible and
interactive is to focus on skill-building. Presenting information and
reinforcing it with a group discussion, small group exercises, or role-playing
scenario can help all participants put their learning into practice. There are
simple techniques for each of these methods to help include people with I/DD.
Most importantly, any activity or role-play scenario should be outlined within
the presentation booklet given out at the start of the academy, so that participants
know to expect these activities during each presentation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>For all forms of presentations, it is important that the
presenter does not spontaneously “call out” any participant to share an answer
or opinion, as this can be inaccessible for people who have difficulty with
spontaneous verbal speech. However, you can leave space for these participants
to share by doing “round robin” exercises, where every participant gets the
chance to share, but also has the option to pass their turn. This can be a
useful tool for group discussions. You can also present a discussion or
role-play topic as a written exercise so that participants have the chance to
write down their responses, and give the option to participants to have someone
else read their response.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:4.4pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Another option is to have participants to break up into
partners or small groups to perform an exercise, and then have each group share
their perspectives. This may help participants who feel overwhelmed in larger
groups get a chance to share, and also allow a partner to present information
to the whole group if the individual is unable to speak to the whole group.
However, it is important to keep in mind that autistic people can have trouble
filtering out noise, so many groups or pairs talking in one room can be
overwhelming. Make sure that each group has their own individual quiet space so
that all participants can process what is going on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Disabled participants who have trouble with verbal speech
or anxiety in social situations may be hesitant to ask questions during a
presentation. You can work around this by giving participants the option of
writing down questions and putting them in a “question box” that will be read
at the end of the session. You should also give participants the email address
of each presenter in case they need time to process the presentation
information and would like to email their questions at a later date.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Some autistic people used methods other than their voice to
speak, which are called Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC). An
example of AAC is a text-to-speech device, like an iPad. These methods take
more time to compose sentences than verbal speech. ASAN has prepared a short
guide on how to fully include individuals who use AAC in your programming,
which can be accessed at <u><span style='color:#405789'>https://pacific-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/PADSAbest-practices-for-inclusion-of-AAC-users.pdf</span></u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:11.45pt;margin-bottom:
5.75pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Autistic people may engage in “stimming” behaviors
such as rocking, flapping, playing with a toy, doodling, or moving around the
room during a presentation. This does not mean we are not paying attention - in
fact, engaging in these activities can help autistic people better focus on
what is going on around them.The autistic community has a saying-we can either
look like we’re paying attention to you, or we can <i>actually</i> be paying
attention to you. Behavior that looks inattentive is in fact crucial to
ensuring that autistic people are able to access and participate in the
conversation. It should be made clear to presenters and staff that this
behavior is acceptable and celebrated. <b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
line-height:112%;color:#3E3672'>Support people (expectations)</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Some participants with intellectual and developmental
disabilities may require a support person in order to participate fully in an
event. Support people can help the participant with a variety of tasks, such as
with activities of daily living (eating, getting from place to place,
administering medications, etc.), helping facilitate communication through a
speech device, or by aiding the participant in following along with an
activity. A disabled person who needs this support will usually find and bring
their own support staff, so event organizers don’t need to be involved in
arranging this. It is important that a request for a support person is treated
in the same way as any other accommodation request - that is, if a participant
is given funding to attend an event, that funding should extend to their
support person. This makes sure that people who need these accommodations are
able to attend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>It is important to note that support people are <b>not</b>
participants in your event, and are not there to participate on behalf of the
attendee who needs them. Having a support person take up space meant for the
participant may make both the participant and others feel uncomfortable
sharing, especially if the support person is sharing opinions that are at odds with
the rest of the group. For this reason, it is recommended to have support
people sign a code of conduct agreement form prior to the event. This form should
indicate that support people must not:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:4.4pt;
margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-.25in'>&#492;    Speak on behalf of a
participant without explicit approval from the self-advocate or share personal
opinions about the content discussed in training and group sessions</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:4.65pt;
margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in;line-height:108%'><span style='font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black'>         </span>&#492;     Try to influence
the questions, thoughts, and opinions participants share with fellow
self-advocates</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:4.65pt;
margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-.25in;line-height:108%'>&#492; Remove a
participant from a training session because the support person is displeased
with the content of the sessions </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><span
style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;color:black'>         </span>&#492;     Interfere
with or remove a participant’s assistive technology</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:7.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>If you find a support person overstepping
these bounds, you can take them aside and go over the agreement form with them
again, and if they continue to break these rules, it is grounds for their
removal from your training. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:4.4pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>We also recommend that participants bring support people
who are not their immediate family members. In many cases, family members are
used to advocating on behalf of the participant, which can lead to more
conflict with complying with the support person code of conduct. If there is no
other support person who can attend besides a family member, it may be helpful
to have a conversation with the family member beforehand about these
expectations in addition to having them sign the agreement form.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Venue/food</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The first priority when choosing a venue should always be
physical accessibility. The best way to ensure this is by visiting the venue
site itself and going through each room you will be using (lodging,
presentation rooms, dining areas, bathrooms, etc). It is also important to note
the general amount of people and noise in the vicinity. If the venue is
constantly crowded and boisterous, there may be better options for your
training. You should do this far in advance of your training, and discuss with
the venue any accommodation needs that they should take note of (for example,
if a student with certain dietary needs has to have access to a refrigerator,
or if you need multiple quiet areas for small group activities). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>A break room should be available at all times during the
event for participants who need a space to decompress. There should be no other
programming occurring in this room, and the room should be clearly labeled as
the “Break Room”. At the beginning of your event, you should explain the
purpose of the break room, and emphasize that it is available for use at any
time, even in the middle of presentations. Make sure that this room is not used
for listening to music, taking phone calls, etc., as this negates the
low-stimuli environment that is the purpose of the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:7.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>If the rooms at your venue do not have
labels, it is important that you label each room based on what activities you
will be doing there (Presentation Room, Group Discussion Room, etc). You should
also note on your schedules the location of each activity, either by the name
or number of the room (if the rooms are named/numbered), or by the general
location (first floor to the right, etc). Providing a map of the venue with
important locations indicated on it can also help participants get oriented to
the space. For larger venues, you can offer an optional tour of the premises on
the date that participants arrive to help speed up the acclimation process.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>If participants will be staying overnight at a venue, a
staff member should be present during the check-in/checkout process. This is a
good time to hand out orientation materials and show participants to their
rooms if they are disoriented from traveling. This also helps make sure all
venue keys are accounted for at the end of the training, and that all
participants get home safely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:11.2pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>As mentioned previously, participants should note their
dietary needs in the accommodations packet prior to your training. If all or
some meals will be provided for participants, this should be noted on their
schedules. If you know what food will be provided for each meal, it is also
helpful to list this information. Even if you make your best effort, there may
be times where a participant is unable to eat any food that is provided during
a meal due to dietary sensitivities, so knowing what food will be there in
advance can let these participants make alternate arrangements. If you will not
be providing meals during your program, it is important to choose a venue
within walking distance to different restaurants or supermarkets, or that has
multiple food delivery options. Having access to a kitchen for multiple-day
programs is also important in this case.</p>

<h1 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.75pt;margin-left:
0in;text-indent:0in'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:#3E3672'>After the training (follow-up, technical assistance)</span></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:7.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:108%'>At the close of the training, debriefing
and getting feedback from participants is necessary to find out what worked
well and what didn’t, so that this critique can be incorporated into future
programming. As with other programming, it is helpful to provide any feedback
questions before the debriefing session so that participants have time to think
about their responses. Asking participants to submit further feedback a week or
two after your event ends is also advisable, as some participants with
intellectual and developmental disabilities may take longer to process their
feelings about the event.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:6.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Reinforcing the lessons learned during a training is
crucial to the continued success of participants in their community organizing
efforts. These follow-up activities are especially important for people with
I/DD, who may need additional support to plan and execute their advocacy goals.
One way for participants in a program to support each other is through the
creation of an alumni group on social media. This space can be a great
opportunity for participants to share advocacy strategies and keep each other
accountable for meeting their advocacy goals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:20.7pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Another method that we have found effective for
facilitating the success of participants is by providing direct technical assistance
through regular check-ins. These check-ins serve as a method for helping
participants talk through their goals and action plans for upcoming advocacy
activities, as well as a chance for them to ask questions and receive resources
from your organization. As with the application and interview portion of your
training, participants should have the option to perform these check-ins
through whichever communication method works best for them (phone, skype, etc).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.35pt;margin-bottom:
6.7pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>It is important to note that creating leadership and
community organizing trainings which are accessible and inclusive for disabled
self-advocates is still a work in progress. Each year we conduct leadership
academies, we run into different access barriers, and incorporate the
experiences of our participants into our accessibility plans for future years.
It is crucial that you take an adaptive approach to the planning and
implementation of your programming; every disabled person has different access
needs, and you may have to approach a problem from multiple angles to find a
solution that works best for everyone involved. However, the general
accessibility and inclusivity strategies we have shared throughout this paper
are safe guidelines to follow to show the disabled community that you are
working to include us in your activities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.85pt;margin-bottom:4.4pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Without trainings that are accessible and inclusive to
people with disabilities, the disability rights movement is weaker due to a
lack of access to organizing tools. In turn, this makes all other movements
weaker for lacking the perspectives of the disability community. We hope we can
work together to address these barriers for the benefit of community organizing
efforts everywhere.</p>
