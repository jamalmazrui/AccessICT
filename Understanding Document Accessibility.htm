<p>This site offers resources to help you create accessible documents.
When you structure your documents correctly, you make your content 
easier for everyone to understand and use. The accessibility
improvements that you implement — like adding alt text and using
headings — have tangible benefits for users with or without
disabilities.</p>
<p>Assistive technologies, such as screen readers, empower people with
visual, auditory, or mobility impairments to be productive and
purposeful. As content creators, we have a responsibility to add to this
culture of inclusivity. By giving others access to content, we leave the
door open for opportunities.</p>

<p>If you’ve used a sidewalk ramp, eyeglasses, or video subtitles,
you’ve used assistive technology which aids with accessibility.</p>
<p>Accessibility, when it comes to digital content, is often compared to
a sidewalk ramp or curb cut — it’s a feature that ends up benefitting
<em>all</em> people, not just those with mobility issues. As document
authors, you need to be aware of the different types of abilities to
plan for when creating accessible documents.</p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of the different barriers and how we can be
inclusive:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual</strong>
<ul>
<li>People with low or no vision.</li>
<li>Help them by structuring documents correctly.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Auditory</strong>
<ul>
<li>People with low or no hearing.</li>
<li>Help them by adding captions and subtitles to your audio or
video.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Mobility</strong>
<ul>
<li>People with physical mobility impairments (or people using mobile
devices).</li>
<li>Help them by making documents easy to navigate and scale.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Cognitive or Neurodivergent</strong>
<ul>
<li>People with situational or developmental disabilities.</li>
<li>Help them by ensuring content is written in plain language. <a

<p>Your primary task when making accessible documents is to ensure
documents are structured correctly so that people assistive technologies
can interact with your digital content. In order to do this, follow the
techniques detailed in this resource.</p>
<p>The steps taken to ensure the accessibility of the documents that you
create are often not laborious. In the end, it often makes the document
easier for all to use.</p>

<p>When converting your office documents to PDF for distribution, it’s
important to consider if PDF is the best choice. Compared to HTML, for
example, PDF documents are harder to use and maintain. PDFs are useful
in certain cases, like completing government forms, but be sure to
understand the limitations of PDF files.<a

<p>Here’s a summary of some problems with PDFs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PDFs are not designed for reading on
screens. </strong>Unlike a responsive website that will allow content to
resize to fit different devices and browsers, a PDF is static and not
designed to be flexible in layout. Also, reading a PDF on smaller device
may require additional scrolling (both horizontal and vertical) as well
as zooming, which may be a frustrating user experience.</li>
<li><strong>PDFs are harder to access.</strong> Even if you create a
fully accessible PDF (properly structured and tagged with alt text and
so on), it’s still possible that the PDF will not meet the accessibility
needs of all users and the assistive technologies that they use.
Providing content in HTML, for example, would allow users to copy and
paste text easily. Users with low-vision would be able to to adjust text
size and colour contrast in their browser settings to make content
easier to read.</li>
<li><strong>PDF use is harder to track and update.</strong> If analytics
are important to you, PDFs might not be the way to go. You can track the
number of times that a PDF file is downloaded, but not which content was
accessed most or which links were followed. If content is locked into a
PDF, it may be harder to revise and less likely to be kept
up-to-date.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing to distribute your content as a PDF, consider your
audience and how they will use the content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will they be downloading and using the PDF for offline use only? If
so a PDF file is a viable option.</li>
<li>Do you need to track how people use the content? Then, it may be
easier to provide your content in HTML.</li>
<li>Is the content robust and require special training to make the PDF
accessible? It may be best to provide the content in several formats,
not just PDF, to make it easier for users to read and use.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We recommend considering HTML instead of or in addition to
PDF where appropriate.</strong> While PDF accessibility has improved
over the years, accessibility support for PDF by authoring tools,
viewers and assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) is not as
widespread as for HTML documents.</p>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Docs</a> lacks several features that
enable accessible office document authoring, most notably, the ability
to create complex accessible tables and a built-in accessibility
checker.</p>
<p>While there is no accessibility checking feature built into Google
Docs, you can install a third-party add-on called <a
href="https://www.grackledocs.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Docs</a>. Grackle is a third-party
plug-in that includes an accessibility checker along with other features
that enhance accessibility on Google Docs (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc11">Technique 11</a>).</p>
<p>Due to the nature of Google Docs, some accessibility features, such
as tables, are only fully accessible when exporting the document to
another format, like a PDF file.</p>
<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using Google Docs to
create documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (i.e., reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>Google Docs does not have a default file format as it is a web-based
authoring tool. Google Docs offers a number of word processor and web
format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for
accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are available
for the following formats in <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc12">Technique 12</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Word (.docx)</li>
<li>OpenDocument Format (.odt)</li>
<li>Rich Text Format (.rtf)</li>
<li>PDF (.pdf)</li>
<li>Plain Text (.txt)</li>
<li>Web Page (.html, zipped)</li>
<li>EPUB Publication (.epub)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users. Files are easily saved as
various file formats (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc12">Technique 12</a>).</p>

<p><span id="chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc1"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>Google Docs lacks support for some accessibility features, such as
table headers that repeat. With this in mind, be cautious of templates
available in the Google Docs template gallery and be sure that they
comply the techniques discussed here.</p>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting. Because templates provide the
starting-point for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you
are unsure whether a template is accessible, you should check a sample
document produced when the template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc11">Technique 11</a>).</p>
<p>Google Docs’s default template for new documents is a blank page. The
basic installation also includes a wide variety of templates ranging
from blank business letters and memos to blank business cards and
schedules. These are all accessible by virtue of being blank. It is
possible to create your own templates from scratch in Google Docs. As
well, you can edit and modify the existing templates, ensuring their
accessibility as you do so and saving them as a new template.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> Updating templates is also a
good opportunity to improve document consistency, copy editing, and
branding.
</div>
<h4>To select a template</h4>
<ol>
<li> Go to <a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Docs</a>.</li>
<li>At the top right, click on <strong>Template Gallery</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gdoc-template-gallery.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1831" width="687" height="258"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Template gallery on the Google Docs home page." /></li>
<li>Select a template.</li>
<li>A copy of the template will open.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document (from the default template or from an existing
template).<br />
<em>Note:</em> If creating a template from an existing document, go
to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Make a copy</strong>. Type a name
and choose where to save it, then, click <strong>Ok</strong>.</li>
<li>Rename your document. Be sure to indicate that the document is an
accessible template by using terms such as “accessible” (e.g.,
“Accessible Memo Template”). This will improve its searchability and
promote its use as an accessible template.</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow techniques in this document. You may also
check the accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc11">Technique 11</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h4>To share your accessible template as a new document</h4>
<p>You can share your accessible template, but it may be more useful to
share the file as copy that other users can add to their Google
Drive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the address bar change the end of the URL before sending
it.</li>
<li>Replace “edit” at the end of the URL with “copy”.<br />

<h2>Technique 2. Specify Document Language</h2>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Google Docs does not offer an explicit
language selection mechanism to indicate the natural language of your
document or changes in natural language at any point within the
content. Google Docs defaults the natural language to the language
selected for your Google Account. Users can change your typing language
in Google Docs (see <a
href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/187189" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google: Change Your Typing Language</a>).</p>
<p>When exporting to other document formats, there is no guarantee that
the natural language of your Google Account will be indicated as the
natural language of your document. In order for assistive technologies
(e.g., screen readers) to be able to present your document accurately,
it is important to indicate the natural language of the document. If a
different natural language is used for a paragraph or selected text,
this also needs to be clearly indicated.</p>
<h4>Use Grackle Docs to specify document language</h4>
<p>While Google Docs does not offer an explicit language selection
mechanism, users can set the document language when using the <a
href="https://www.grackledocs.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Docs</a> plugin (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc11">Technique 11</a>). Using
Grackle, users can set document properties including document title and
document language. This is mainly needed if using Grackle to export to
other file formats, like PDF.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc3"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>Google Docs offers a mechanism for adding alternative text to images
and objects where it can be readily accessed by screen reader users.
While you can add alt text, you will need to ensure that you provide the
longer descriptions in the body of the document, near the images and
objects. While this solution is not optimal for screen reader users and
will complicate your own accessibility testing, it is necessary until
long descriptions are supported.</p>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* on the image.</li>
<li>Select Alt Text from the contextual menu.<br />

class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1837" width="321" height="545"
alt=": Image demonstrates the location of the Alt text function in the right-click context menu." /></li>
<li>Add your alt text to the <strong>Description</strong> field.<br />

class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1838" width="545" height="390"
alt="Image demonstrates the Alt Text pop-up menu with focus on the Description field." /></li>
<li>Press <strong>OK</strong> to save<em>Note:</em><span
style="font-size: 1em">Enter a description in the
</span><strong>Title</strong><span style="font-size: 1em">field will
show a pop-up tooltip when users hover over the image with their mouse. 
However, it is recommended to put the image description in the
</span><strong>Description</strong><span
style="font-size: 1em">field.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><span id="chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc4"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 4. Avoid “Floating” Elements</h2>
<p>When images and objects are inserted into Google Docs they default to
being positioned “inline” with the text. There is also the option to
attach images and objects to a fixed position on the page. A “floating”
object keeps its position relative to the page, while text flows around
it. As content moves up or down on the page, the object stays where it
was placed. To ensure that images and objects remain with the text that
references it, always position it as “inline” with the text at the end
of the in-text reference. Similarly, avoid placing drawing objects
directly into the document (e.g., as borders, to create a diagram).
Instead, create borders with page layout tools and insert complete
graphical objects.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc5"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Headings</h2>
<p>Any document longer than a few paragraphs could benefit from adding
structure to make content easier for readers to understand. <strong>One
of the simplest ways to do this is to use actual headings</strong> (or
“true headings”) to create logical divisions between paragraphs. Using
actual headings means applying a built-in heading style — rather than
just formatting content with bolded, enlarged, or centered text.
Built-in heading styles are structural elements that communicate order
and levels, which provide a meaningful sequence to users of assistive
technologies.</p>

<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> Using actual headings provides
several important benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headings are used by Google Docs to auto-generate a table of
contents (see Technique 7.5: Use a Table of Contents).</li>
<li>Headings are used by the Outline function in Google Docs to create a
navigation pane, especially helpful for long documents (see <a
href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6367684" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google: Use document outlines</a>); and you
can update all of the headings of a particular type at once, which keeps
them consistent.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for headings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the default headings styles provided (“Heading “, “Heading 2”,
…, “Heading 9”).</li>
<li>Six (6) levels of headings are supported.</li>
<li>Nest headings properly (e.g., the sub-headings of a “Heading 1” are
“Heading 2”, etc.). Do not skip headings.</li>
<li>If you plan to create a Word document that will have an
automatically generated table of contents, remember that text marked
with “Heading 1” will appear in the table of contents. Therefore, you
may want to mark the top-level title of the document, which typically
wouldn’t be included in the document’s table of contents, with the
“Title” style. On the other hand, if you plan to convert to HTML, the
main title is usually marked with a “Heading 1” which will be mapped to
an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> HTML element.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To apply headings from the Format menu</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the text that you want to make into a navigational
heading.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Paragraph Styles</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the desired heading you would like to apply to the text.</li>

<h2>Technique 6. Use Named Styles</h2>
<p>As with actual or “true” headings (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc5">Technique 5</a>), you should
attempt to make use of the named styles that are included with the
office application (e.g., “emphasis”, “caption”, etc.) before creating
your own styles or using the character formatting tools directly. Named
styles help your readers understand why something was formatted in a
given way, which is especially helpful when there are multiple reasons
for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use italics for emphasis,
Latin terms and species names). For more information on formatting using
named styles, see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc9">Technique 9</a>.
<em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in much
the same way, the named styles often differ.</p>
<h4>To use default named styles</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Default named styles can be applied the same way as headings (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc5">Technique 5</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc7"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 7. Use Built-In Document Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>At this time, Google Docs does not offer a mechanism that allows you
to select and indicate headings for rows and columns. Since it is not
possible to create complex tables in Google Docs that are accessible,
a<span style="font-size: 1em">void creating complex tables since table
headers cannot be designated. </span></p>
<p><span style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em">If you use the <a
href="https://www.grackledocs.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Docs</a> add-on, tables can be given
structure and table headings can be indicated. While these fixes won’t
be useful for making tables more accessible in Google Docs, it does
allow you to export the document into another format with appropriate
table tags intact. For more on Grackle Docs, see </span> <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc11"
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em">Technique 11</a> <span
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em">. </span></p>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>Since Google Docs does not provide a feature to repeat header rows at
the top of each page, you would need to break your table into separate
tables. Then, you would manually add a row at the top of the table and
copy/paste header info at the top of each page. For detailed
instructions on how to work with tables in Google Docs, see <a
href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/1696711" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google: Add and edit Tables</a>.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting, such as
to position columns.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cell labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc4">Technique 4</a>).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h3>7.2 Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; List styles</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the list style you want to use.</li>
</ol>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use <strong>Columns</strong> feature for placing text in columns.
<em>Note:</em> Because columns can be a challenge for users of some
assistive technologies, consider whether a column layout is really
necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Page Breaks</h3>
<p>Start a new page by inserting a page break (<em>Windows:</em> CTRL +
Enter; <em>Mac:</em> ⌘ + Enter) instead of repeated hard returns.</p>
<h3>7.5 Use a Table of Contents</h3>
<p>Creating an index or table of contents to outline office-document
content can provide a means of navigating the meaningful sequence of
content. You can see your document’s structure with a table of contents.
Each item in the table of contents links to your document’s
headings.</p>
<p>The best way to generate a table of contents is after applying the
predefined heading styles, such as “Heading 1” as described above, to
the headings that you want to include in your table of contents. After
you apply these styles, you can then create a table of contents.</p>
<h4>To insert a Table of Contents</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Position cursor where you would like to place the table within your
document.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Table of
contents</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To update a Table of Contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Click within the table.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Refresh</strong> button. <img
src="OEBPS/assets/gdocs-refresh-button-e1573233594492.png"
class="wp-image-1846 size-full alignnone" width="41" height="40"
alt="Image demonstrates the Refresh button that allows you to automatically update the table of contents." /></li>
</ol>
<p>For more details, see: <a
href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/116338" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google: How to add or change a table of
contents</a>.</p>
<h3>7.6 Use Page Numbering</h3>
<p>In Google Docs, you can add page numbers and the number of total
pages to a document.</p>
<p>Numbering the pages of your document helps those reading and editing
your document effectively navigate and reference its content. For users
of assistive technologies, it provides a valuable point of reference
within the document.</p>
<h4>To insert page numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the top left, select <strong>Insert</strong> and then
<strong>Header &amp; page number</strong>.</li>
<li>Then choose:<br />
<strong>Page number:</strong> Choose where you want the page numbers to
go, and whether you want the first page to be skipped.<br />
<strong>Page count:</strong> The page count will be added wherever your
cursor is placed in the document.</li>
<li>The page numbers or page count will be added automatically.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more details, see <a
href="https://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/docs/chapter/google-docs-updated"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google: Add or remove headers,
footers and page numbers</a>.</p>
<h3>7.7 Document Title</h3>
<p>At this time, Google Docs makes use of a single document name. Within
Google Docs, this serves well as a title, but when exporting to ODT, the
document name is used to form the file name and the ODT “Title”
properties field is left blank. <em>Note:</em> In case the document is
ever converted into HTML, it should be given a descriptive and
meaningful title.</p>
<p>If using third-party add-on <a href="https://www.grackledocs.com"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Docs</a>, you can add
a document title. After updating this setting, the document title  will
be preserved in the document’s metadata when exporting to PDF using
Grackle. It is one of the first checks that appears in the Grackle Docs
sidebar after launching (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc11">Technique 11</a>).</p>
<h4>To change the file name of the current document</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Rename</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Rename Document</strong> dialog, enter a new document
name.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience. All basic
accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your
document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within
your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color alone,
to convey information. As well, some further steps should be taken to
ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give
users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the
information.</p>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply textures rather
than color to differentiate the bars</li>
<li>Change the default colors to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc92">Technique 9.2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> If the chart data is also
provided in an appendix, it will be easier for all users to make use of
the data.
</div>
<h4>To add a chart to Google Docs</h4>
<p>Charts that you create in Google Sheets can be linked to a Google
Docs document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Insert</strong> &gt;  <strong>Chart</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the type of chart you want to add.</li>
<li>When you add a new chart, it will link to a new Google Sheet. To
update the the data in the chart, update the numbers in the linked
Google Sheet.</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<p><span id="chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc9"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3><span id="chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc92"></span>9.2 Use
Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern. In order to determine whether the colors in your
document have sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast
checker, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use Google Docs’s review
functionality features to track changes, such as the revision history
and TextFlow mechanisms.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted in <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc3">Technique 3</a>.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate, and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own.</p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Link.</strong> Alternately, you
can select the text you’d like to add a link to and press Ctrl+K (or
Cmd+K on Macs).</li>
<li>In the pop-up box, enter descriptive text in the
<strong>Text</strong> display box.</li>
<li>Enter the link address in the <strong>Link</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong><strong>Apply</strong></strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gdoc-link.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1868" width="457" height="142"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Text to display box and Link address box." /></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc11"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document
or template (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc1">Technique 1</a>), then you
may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order to perform an
accessibility check in one of those formats, as described below.</p>
<p>While there is no accessibility checking feature built into Google
Docs, you can install a third-party add-on called Grackle Docs.</p>
<h3>Grackle Docs</h3>
<p><strong>What is Grackle Docs?</strong><a
href="https://www.grackledocs.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Docs</a> is a third-party add-on that
runs on documents created in Google Docs. It helps with checking and
improving the digital accessibility of your document. Due to the nature
of Google Docs, some accessibility features, such as tables, are only
fully accessible when exporting the document to another format, like a
PDF file.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong> After Grackle is launched, It
scans the current document for accessibility issues and identifies and
locates errors. Feedback appears in a sidebar that is docked on
right-side of the screen. By exploring the sidebar, you can immediately
learn about accessibility issues and find and fix the detected errors by
interacting with the Grackle sidebar.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Grackle’s accessibility checker is free to use;
however, the ability to export and produce accessible HTML and PDF
documents is only free for the first 30 days (as of December 2019).</p>
<p>At present, Grackle Docs performs the following 22 accessibility
checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document
<ul>
<li>Document title is required</li>
<li>Document language should be specified</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Images
<ul>
<li>Images should have alternate text or mark as artifact</li>
<li>Drawings should have alternate text or mark as artifact</li>
<li>Equations should be described</li>
<li>Images may need to be downsampled to reduce file size</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Headings
<ul>
<li>Headings should be used</li>
<li>A single “Heading 1” should be used</li>
<li>Headings must be properly nested</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tables
<ul>
<li>Tables must be tagged or marked as layout tables</li>
<li>The use of merged cells is not recommended</li>
<li>The use of empty cells is not recommended</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Landmarks
<ul>
<li>Headers and footers should be used</li>
<li>Footnotes should have ids and alt text</li>
<li>Lists should be used where appropriate</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Content
<ul>
<li>Document should not contain unsupported content</li>
<li>High color contrast should be used</li>
<li>Fine print should be avoided</li>
<li>All-caps styling should be avoided</li>
<li>Adjusted alignment not suggested for non-heading text</li>
<li>Lengthy paragraphs should be avoided</li>
<li>Links should be informative</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Evaluating Accessibility in Other Formats</h3>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>Save the document into HTML format and use one of the web
accessibility checkers available online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Acrobat Professional</a></li>
<li><a

<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h3>Alternate formats</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Download
as</strong></li>
<li>Select format <em>Note:</em> documents saved as HTML format may
require some cleaning up. The steps below will help you with this.</li>
</ol>
<h4>PDF</h4>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc11">Technique 11</a> .</p>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ol>
<li>Remove unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;
tags</li>
<li>Check for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml_gdoc11">Technique 11</a>)
<em>Note:</em> you may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help
with this process.</li>
</ol>

alt="The curb cut icon is a light bulb super-imposed over a ramp" />
This icon highlights “curb cut” opportunities in these techniques. “Curb
cuts” are situations in which accommodations made for accessibility
reasons will also result in significantly better and more efficient
outcomes for everyone. The name comes from sidewalk “curb cuts” that
were added for people in wheelchairs, but are commonly used by people
with baby strollers, handcarts, wheeled luggage, and others.

<p>At the time of testing (December 2019), Word provides a set of
accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the production of
accessible digital office documents. In addition, Word includes an <a
href="#chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_tech10">accessibility checking
feature</a>. This guide is intended to be used for documents that
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity),</li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (e.g., Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Word is <strong>Office Open XML
(DOCX)</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, Word offers many other word processor and web format
saving options (e.g., PDF, HTML, OpenDocument Text, Rich Text Format,
etc.). Most of these have not been checked for accessibility, but some
information and/or instructions are available in <a
href="#chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_tech11">Technique 11</a>.</p>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or (2) Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility
of your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any
specific disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is
required, it is recommended that you test the office documents with end
users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</li>
<li>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Microsoft Word 2013 and Microsoft Word included with
Office 365 while creating a DOCX document.</li>

<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd">
<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 Applicability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All success criteria</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>All office documents start with a template. These can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or complex nearly complete document with
text, graphics, and other content (e.g., a “meeting minutes” template).
Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_tech10">Technique 10. Check
Accessibility</a>). Word’s default template for new documents is a blank
page. The basic installation also includes a variety of other blank
office-related documents. These are all accessible by virtue of being
blank. It is also possible to create your own accessible templates.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> Updating templates is also a
good opportunity to improve document consistency, copy-editing, and
branding.
</div>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document (from the default blank template or from one
of the prepackaged templates).</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow all of the techniques in this document.</li>
<li>When finished, check the accessibility of the document (see <a
href="#chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml#word10-10">Technique 10.
Check Accessibility</a>).</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Templates</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> list, select <strong>Word
Template (*.dotx)</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive <strong>File name</strong> (e.g., “Accessible Memo
Template”) may increase the prominence of the accessibility status. As
well, filling in the text boxes labeled <strong>Tags</strong> and
<strong>Title</strong> with the terms that include “accessibility” may
improve the discoverability of the template as an accessible file.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSWord2013_1.png" width="790" height="466"
alt="Image demonstrates location of the File name text box, the Save as type drop-down menu, the Tags field and the Title field in the Save As dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p>Only use these steps if you have an accessible template available
(e.g., one that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply open a new
(blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Personal</strong>.</li>
<li>Select your accessible template from the list.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSWord2013_3.png" width="481" height="448"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Personal templates gallery." /></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you chose
an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point.</li>
<li><strong>As you add your content (e.g., text, images, etc.), ensure
that you consult the sections that follow to preserve
accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Specify Document Language</h2>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd">
<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 Applicability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3.1.1 Language of Page</li>
<li>3.1.2 Language of Parts</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In order to enable for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers)
to present your document accurately, you must indicate the natural
(human) language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> The specified document
language is also used by the spelling and grammar checker. In Canada,
make sure to choose “English (Canada)” to avoid having to override
American spellings of words such as “colour.”
</div>
<h4>To change the default language</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Options</strong> from the list in the left window
pane.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Language</strong> from the list in the left of the
<strong>Options</strong> dialog.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Choose Editing Languages</strong>, select the editing
language you want to use.<br />
<em>Note:</em> To add an editing language, select the language from the
drop down list labeled “<strong>Add additional editing
languages</strong>.”</li>
<li>Select <strong>Set as Default.</strong></li>
<li>Close all Office documents and open them again for the changes to
take effect.<br />

alt="Image demonstrates location of Language option, Editing Language options list, Set as Default button, and Add additional editing languages drop-down menu in the Options dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<p>Word has an automatic language detection mechanism, which can
automatically detect the language of your text. If you type a section of
text in a different language than the rest of your document, Word should
programmatically mark the language of that section of text
appropriately.</p>
<h4>To turn on automatic language detection</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Review</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Language</strong> section, select the
<strong>Language</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Set Proofing Language</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Language</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Detect
language automatically</strong> check box.<br />

</ol>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Review</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Language</strong> section, select the
<strong>Language</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Set Proofing Language</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Mark selected text as</strong> box, select the

<h2>Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd">
<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 Applicability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.1.1 Non-text Content</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This is done by adding concise alternative text to of each image. If an
image is too complicated to concisely describe in the alternative text
alone (e.g., artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> Sometimes it may not be clear
what a particular image is meant to convey and alternative text can
provide that clarity. Also, alternate text has been shown to be included
in search engines rankings.
</div>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the following question: “What information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank.</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, include all of the text in
the alternative.</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences.</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below.</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question: “What information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone.</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the object.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Format Picture…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Layout &amp; Properties</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Alt Text</strong> option from the list under that
tab.</li>
<li>Fill in the <strong>Description</strong> field (<em>not</em> the
“Title” field).<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSWord2013_7.png" width="497" height="339"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Title and Description boxes in the Alt Text section of the Format Picture dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<p>When inserting a very small image (or resizing a larger image to be
much smaller) and following it with text, Word sometimes assumes that
the image is intended to be a bullet-point for a bulleted list. Once
Word defines the image as a bullet, the option to add alternative text
disappears. Select <strong>Undo</strong>, to redefine the bullet as an
image.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">

<h2>Technique 4. Avoid “Floating” Elements</h2>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd">
<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 Applicability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When certain elements (e.g., images, objects, text boxes) are
inserted into Word documents they default to being an “inline object”.
Inline objects keep their position on the page relative to a position in
the text. This is beneficial for users of assistive technologies (e.g.,
screen readers), because the position of the object in the document
order is clear, so the screen reader can read the object’s alternative
content (e.g., Description field) when the user moves keyboard focus to
that position. However, Word also provides the option to have these
elements “float” outside of the text order, with text flowing around,
under or over it. This is a problem because the position of the object
in the document is no longer clear and the screen reader will often read
the alternative text out of context, which can be confusing. These text
flow options should be avoided. Similarly, avoid placing drawing objects
such as arrows, lines and shapes directly into the document (e.g., as
borders, to create a diagram). Instead, create borders with page layout
tools and insert complete graphical objects (e.g., pictures).</p>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> In-line elements are often
easier to work with than floating elements, which can end up being
shifted into strange positions as editing earlier parts of a document
cause repagination.
</div>
<h4>To prevent an image or object from “floating”</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the object.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Page Layout</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Position</strong> from the <strong>Arrange</strong>
section.</li>
<li>Select <strong>In Line with Text</strong>.<br />

</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> In later versions of Word, you can
also keep pictures in-line with text by selecting the object and choose
a wrapping option from the pop-up icon.</p>

<h2>Technique 5. Use Headings</h2>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd">
<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 Applicability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.3.1 Info and Relationships</li>
<li>2.4.1 Bypass Blocks</li>
<li>2.4.6 Headings and Labels</li>
<li>2.4.10 Section Headings</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Any documents that are longer than a few paragraphs require
structuring to make them easier for readers to understand. One of the
simplest ways to do this is to use <strong>“True Headings”</strong> to
create logical divisions between paragraphs. True headings are more than
just bolded, enlarged, or centred text; they are structural elements
that order and levels provide a meaningful sequence to users of
assistive technologies.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> Using true headings provides
several important benefits: (1) Headings are used by Word to
auto-generate a table of contents (see <a
href="#chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_contents">Technique 6.5 Use a
Table of Contents</a>); (2) Headings are used by the “Navigation Pane”
which is especially helpful for long documents (see <a
href="#chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_navpane">Word’s “Navigation”
Feature</a>); and you can update all of the headings of a particular
type at once, which keeps them consistent.
</div>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for headings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the default headings styles provided (“Heading “, “Heading 2”,
…, “Heading 9”).</li>
<li>Nine levels of headings are supported.</li>
<li>Nest headings properly (e.g., the sub-headings of a “Heading 1” are
“Heading 2”, etc.).</li>
<li>If you plan to create a Word document that will have an
automatically generated table of contents, remember that text marked
with “Heading 1” will appear in the table of contents. Therefore, you
may want to mark the top-level title of the document, which typically
wouldn’t be included in the document’s table of contents, with the
“Title” style. On the other hand, if you plan to convert to HTML, the
main title is usually marked with a “Heading 1” which will be mapped to
an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> HTML element.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To apply headings to selected text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select text.</li>
<li>Right-click* and select <strong>Styles</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the heading style (Heading 1, Heading 2, and so on) from the
list.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply headings using the Styles toolbar</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select text.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, select the heading style
that you wish to apply<br />
<em>Note:</em> You can scroll through the multiple heading styles using

height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> Using built-in structural
features is much more reliable that trying to use typography for
formatting (e.g., tabs to separate table cells, repeated new lines for a
page break).
</div>
<h3>6.1 Tables</h3>
</div>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting, such as
to position columns.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g. “A sample order form
with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cell labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page (see <a
href="#chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_tech4">Technique 4. Avoid
“Floating” Elements</a>).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To insert a table</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Tables</strong> section, select <strong>Insert
Table</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Number of columns</strong> and the <strong>Number
of rows</strong> you would like your table to have.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>OK</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To a heading row</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor in the top-row of the table that you would like to
make into the heading row.</li>
<li>The <strong>Table Tools</strong> menu item should appear.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Table Tools &gt; Layout</strong>.</li>
<li>In the Table section, select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Row</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Repeat as header row at the top of each
page</strong> checkbox.</li>
</ol>
<h3>6.2. Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists.” Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph</strong> section, select the
<strong>Bullets</strong> icon for unordered lists or select the
<strong>Numbering</strong> icon for ordered lists.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify list styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph</strong> section, select the arrow beside
the <strong>Bullets</strong> icon for unordered lists or select the
arrow beside the <strong>Numbering</strong> icon for ordered lists.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Define New Bullet…</strong> to create a new unordered
list format.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Define New Number Format…</strong> to create a new
ordered list format.</li>
<li>In the <strong>New Bullet</strong> dialog or the <strong>New Number
Format</strong> dialog, select the list characteristics.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>6.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use the <strong>Columns</strong> feature for placing text in columns.
<em>Note:</em> Because columns can be a challenge for some users with
disabilities (e.g., people using magnifiers), consider whether a column
layout is really necessary.</p>
<h3>6.4 Page Breaks</h3>
<p>Start a new page by inserting a page break instead of repeated hard
returns.</p>
<h4>To add a page break</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Page Layout</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Page Setup</strong> section, select the arrow beside
the <strong>Breaks</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Select the type of break to add. <strong>Page break</strong> is used
to start a new page with the same page layout (page orientation,
headers, page numbering, etc.). <strong>Section break</strong> is used
if you want to start a new section of the document with a differing page
layout.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span id="chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_contents"></span>6.5
Table of Contents</h3>
<p>Creating an index or table of contents to outline office document
content can provide a means of navigating the meaningful sequence of
content. The best way to generate a table of contents is after applying
the predefined heading styles (e.g., “Heading 1,” “Heading 2,” “Heading
3”) as described above, to the headings that you want to include in your
table of contents. After you apply these styles, you can then create a
table of contents. <em>Note:</em> If you do not want the main title of
the document to appear in the generated table of contents, mark it with
the “Title” style.</p>
<h4>To insert a table of contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor in your document where you want to create the table
of contents.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>References</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> section, select
<strong>Table of Contents</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the style that you want to use.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To update a table of contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the table of contents.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>References</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> section, select the
<strong>Update Table</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<h3>6.6 Page Numbering</h3>
<p>Numbering the pages of you document helps those reading and editing
your document effectively navigate and reference its content. For users
of assistive technologies, it can provide a valuable point of reference
within the document.</p>
<h4>To insert page numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Header &amp; Footer</strong> section, select
<strong>Page Number</strong>.</li>
<li>Select where you would like to insert your page numbers.</li>
<li>Select the style of page number you would like to use.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To format page numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Header &amp; Footer</strong> section, select
<strong>Page Number</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Format Page Numbers…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Page Number Format</strong> dialog, select the page
format characteristics you would like to use.<br />
<em>Note:</em> These changes are applied to the predefined page format
styles. It does not create a new page format style.</li>
</ol>
<h3>6.7 Document Title</h3>
<p>If you plan to convert the document into HTML, it should be given a
descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Info</strong> from the list in the left window
pane</li>
<li>In the right window pane, select the <strong>Title</strong> text box
and enter an appropriate title.<br />
<em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the properties is
different than the file name.</li>

<h2>Technique 7. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd">

<ul>
<li>1.1.1 Non-text Content</li>
<li>1.3.1 Info and Relationships</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>All the basic accessibility considerations that are applied to the
rest of your document must also be applied to your charts and the
elements within your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather
than color alone, to convey information.
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind.</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply textures rather
than colours to differentiate the bars</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to
give users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret
the information.</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colours, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_contrast">Technique 8.2 Use
Sufficient Contrast</a>)</li>
<li>Consider providing the data that you used to create the chart in
tabular form (e.g., as an appendix).</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"

height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> All users will benefit from
content that is easier to see.
</div>
<h3>8.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) are
typically easier to read than serif fonts (e.g. Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such as the pagination, the
layout of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable default level of accessibility.</p>
<h4>To change the text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, right-click* the
<strong>Style</strong> you wish to modify.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify Style</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Formatting</strong> in the <strong>Modify</strong>
dialog box, select the appropriate font size.</li>
<li>Exit with <strong>OK</strong>.<br />

alt="Image demonstrates location of Formatting options in the Modify Style dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3><span id="chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_contrast"></span>8.2 Use
Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least <strong>4.5:1</strong>.</p>
<p>To help you determine the contrast, here are some examples on a white
background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid colour for a text background rather
than a pattern. In order to determine whether the colours in your
document have sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast
checker, such as the <a
href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastAnalyser"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TPG Contrast Analyser</a> or
the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a>.</p>
<h3>8.3 Avoid Relying on Color or Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the colour or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the colour of text you have
edited and noting the colour. Instead use Word’s “Track Changes” feature
to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8.4 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or colour combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text.” If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>

your content in a consistent way, it will be easier to access, navigate
and interpret for all users.
</div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g. headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own.</p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Type (or paste in) a web address and press spacebar or “Enter” to
convert into a hyperlink.</li>
<li>Select the link and right-click*.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Edit Hyperlink</strong> (Ctrl + K).</li>
<li>Edit the text in the <strong>Text to display</strong> box.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technique 10. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of your document or template
(see <a href="#chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_tech1">Technique 1. Use
Accessible Templates</a>), Word offers an “Accessibility Checker” to
review your document against a set of possible issues that users with
disabilities may experience in your file.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> No checker can detect all types of
accessibility issues. For example it can tell if alternative text is
missing, but it cannot tell if alternative text is actually correct. It
also doesn’t test for some issues, including colour contrast. The Office
website provides more information about the <a
href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Check-for-accessibility-issues-a16f6de0-2f39-4a2b-8bd8-5ad801426c7f"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accessibility Checker</a>,
including the rules it uses to identify and classify accessibility
issues. The “Accessibility Checker” classifies issues as</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error</strong> – content that makes a file very difficult or
impossible for people with disabilities to understand</li>
<li><strong>Warning</strong> – content that in most, but not all, cases
makes a file difficult for people with disabilities to understand</li>
<li><strong>Tip</strong> – content that people with disabilities can
understand, but that might be better organized or presented in a way
that would maximize their experience</li>
</ul>
<h4>To use the “Accessibility Checker”</h4>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the file is saved as a DOCX. (<em>Note:</em> Older DOC
files are not compatible with the checker).</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Info</strong> in the left window pane.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Check for Issues</strong> dropdown.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Check Accessibility</strong> item.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSWord2013_9.png" width="594" height="629"

<h2>Technique 11. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h4>Saving to PDF</h4>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a
href="#chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_tech10">Technique 10. Check
Accessibility</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save As</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the
file.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> list, select
<strong>PDF</strong> (*.pdf).</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Options</strong> button.</li>
<li>Ensure that the <strong>Document structure tags for
accessibility</strong> checkbox is selected.</li>

<li>Select <strong>Save As</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the
file.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> box, select <strong>Web
Page</strong> (*.htm).</li>
<li>Check the title in the <strong>Title</strong> text box. To change
it, select the <strong>Change Title…</strong> to open an “Enter Text”
dialog box.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
<li>Check the HTML file for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_tech10">Technique 10. Check
Accessibility</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ol>
<li>Remove unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class, and attributes.</li>
<li>Remove font tags.</li>
<li>Remove styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag.</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute.</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;
tags.</li>
<li>Check for accessibility (see <a

with this process.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Other Application Features</h2>
<h3><span id="chapter-004-microsoft-word.xhtml_navpane"></span>Word’s
“Navigation” Feature</h3>
<p>After you have populated your document with content and true headings
have been applied, you may wish to rearrange the content. In order to
maintain the integrity and accessibility of the altered sequence, you
will need to ensure that structural information (e.g. heading levels) is
adjusted accordingly. Word provides a “Navigation” mechanism which
displays all parts of the document, such as headings, paragraphs,
objects, etc. in sequential order. It helps you navigate, access, and
manipulate the content. You can move headings or subordinate text up or
down, rearranging their sequence in a way that can be programmatically
determined and therefore accessible to assistive technologies.</p>
<h4>To use the “Navigation” feature</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Show</strong> section, select the <strong>Navigation
Pane</strong> check box.</li>
<li>The <strong>Navigation</strong> pane will open to the left of your
document.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To jump to a location in a document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select one of three navigation options:
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Headings</strong><em>Note:</em> select the heading to
view hierarchical headings and content below it.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Pages.</strong></li>
<li>Select the (Search) <strong>Results</strong>.<br />

</ol></li>
<li>Scroll through the sequential list and double-click* on the location
you would like to jump to</li>
</ol>
<h4>To move content up or down in a document</h4>
<ul>
<li>Select and drag the content to a new location in the list.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (December 2019), Word for Mac provides a set
of accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the production of
accessible digital office documents. However, Word 2011 for Mac does not
include an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> Later versions of Word for Mac
include an accessibility checker (for 2016 and later versions). For more
information, see <a
href="#chapter-005-microsoft-word-2011-mac.xhtml_tech11">Technique

documents accessible to people with disabilities</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This guide is intended to be used for documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity),</li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on creating forms, web pages, applications, or
other dynamic and/or interactive content that are accessible, you should
consult the W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WCAG 2.0</a>) because these are specifically
designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or interactive
content.</p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p><strong>The default file format for Word for Mac is Office Open XML
(DOCX).</strong></p>
<p>In addition, Word for Mac offers many other word processor and web
format saving options, however most of these have not been checked for
accessibility.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>The following techniques will increase the accessibility of your
documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups. In cases where more certainty is required, it is
recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users.</li>
<li>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Microsoft Word 2011:Mac and Microsoft Word for Mac 2016
(version 16.16.16) while creating a DOCX document.</li>
<li>This document is provided for information purposes only and is
neither a recommendation nor a guarantee of results. If errors are
found, please report them to: <a

</ul>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content.</p>
<p>Microsoft Word for Mac’s default template for a new documents is a
blank page. It is possible to create your own accessible templates from
scratch in Word for Mac. As well, you can edit and modify the existing
prepackaged templates, ensuring accessibility as you do so and saving
them as a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document <em>(from the default blank template or from
one of the prepackaged templates</em>)</li>
<li>Follow the techniques in this guide.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save
As</strong>.</li>
<li>In the Save As box, insert a name for the template.<em>Tip: Using a
descriptive File name (e.g., “Accessible Memo Template”) may increase
the prominence of the accessibility status.</em></li>
<li>In the <strong>Format box</strong>, select <strong>Word
Template</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Templates.jpg" width="706" height="690"
alt="Screenshot of the template option in the save dialog box." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p>Only use the following steps if an accessible template is available
(e.g. a previous templates that is already created). Otherwise, simply
open a new blank document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the template icon (<em>top left corner</em>).<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/03.jpg" width="154" height="53"
alt="Screenshot of the templates icon in the top navigation bar" /></li>
<li>Under Templates, select <strong>My Templates</strong> (<em>in the
word document gallery</em>).</li>
<li>Select the template from the scrolling gallery.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Choose</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/04.jpg" width="880" height="500"
alt="Screenshot of the new template in the gallery." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Specify Document Language</h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present the document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document (e.g., English, French). If a different
natural language is used for a paragraph or selected text, this also
needs to be clearly indicated.</p>
<h4>To change the default language</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools</strong>
&gt;<strong><strong>Language…<br />
</strong></strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/05.jpg" width="271"
height="126" alt="Screenshot of the language option" /></li>
<li>In the <strong>Mark selected text as:</strong> box, select the
language.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Default…<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/06.jpg" width="302" height="330"
alt="Screenshot of the language dialog box with the Default button highlighted" /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools</strong> &gt;
<strong>Language…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Mark selected text as:</strong> box, select the
language.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/07.jpg" width="302" height="330"
alt="Screenshot of the language dialog box with the OK button highlighted" /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 3. Provide Alternatives Text for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank.</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated.</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences.</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below.</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone.</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select Image.</li>
<li>(<em>*Right click or Control+click</em>) Select
<strong><strong>Format Picture…<br />
</strong></strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/08.jpg" width="469"
height="431"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of Format Picture" /></li>
<li>In the “<strong>Format Picture</strong>” window left menu, select
<strong>Alt Text</strong>.</li>
<li>Insert description.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.<br />

<h2>Technique 4. Avoid “Floating” Elements</h2>
<p>When images and objects are inserted into Word for Mac documents,
they default to being an “in line with text.” In this case, you do not
need to change anything.</p>
<p>However, if you are editing a document that includes a “floating”
image or object, use the procedure below:</p>
<h4>To prevent an image or object from “floating”</h4>
<ol>
<li>Under <strong>Arrange</strong> (<em>top navigation bar</em>).</li>
<li>Select <strong>Wrap text</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>In Line with Text</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Image-Wrap-updated.png"
alt="Image demonstrates the layout changes that can occur in the top navigation bar." /></li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> For later versions of Word, the
instructions are simplified slightly, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the image.</li>
<li>Under the Picture Format tab, you’ll see the drop-down menu for
<strong>Wrap text</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p><span
id="chapter-005-microsoft-word-2011-mac.xhtml_word11-5"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Headings</h2>
<p>Any documents that are longer than a few paragraphs require
structuring to make them more straightforward for readers to understand.
One of the easiest ways to do this is to use “True Headings”. True
headings are more than just bolded, enlarged, or centred text; they are
structural elements that order and levels provide a meaningful sequence
to users of assistive technologies.</p>
<h4>To apply headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select text.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> panel select the heading you wish to
apply (in the Home bar)<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/TOC2.jpg" width="622" height="116"
alt="Image demonstrates the importance of changing the heading of the contents that will be on table of contents." /><br />
<em>Note:</em> If the Styles panel is not in view, go to menu item:
<strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Toolbox</strong>,
<strong>Styles</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Style1.jpg" class="alignnone"
style="font-size: 14pt" width="256" height="435"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of &quot;Styles&quot; in&quot; view&quot; drop down menu." /></li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> In later versions of Word for Mac,
the <strong>Styles Pane</strong> button is visible on the right side of
the <strong>Home </strong>tab.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/word2016mac-styles-pane.png"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Styles button on the Home tab." /></p>
</div>
</div>
<h4>To modify heading styles</h4>
<p>This refers to changing the appearance of all text marked with a
certain style.</p>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> dialog box, select the
<strong>heading</strong> you want to modify.</li>
<li>Select the drop down menu on the side of the selected heading.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify Style…<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/Style2.jpg" width="216" height="392"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of &quot;Modify Style&quot; in the &quot;Styles&quot; dialog box." /></li>
<li>In the <strong>Modify Style</strong> dialog, make the appropriate
changes to style characteristics.</li>
<li>Select <strong><strong>OK</strong>.<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/Style3.jpg" width="463" height="567"
alt="Image demonstrates the changes that can occur in the &quot;Modify Style&quot; dialog box." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To create a new style</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> dialog box (<em><strong>View</strong>
&gt; <strong>Toolbox</strong>,
<strong>Styles</strong></em>)<strong>.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong><strong>New Style…<br />
</strong></strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/Style4.jpg" width="211"
height="396"
alt="Image locates the New Style button on the Styles box." /></li>
<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> box, enter a name for the new
style.</li>
<li>Format the characteristics of the new style.</li>
<li>Select <strong><strong>OK</strong>.<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/Style5.jpg" width="457" height="567"
alt="Image demonstrates the changes that need occur in the &quot;New Style&quot; dialog box." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Use Named Styles</h2>
<p>Named styles help your readers understand why something was formatted
in a given way, which is especially helpful when there are multiple
reasons for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use italics for
emphasis, Latin terms and species names).</p>
<h4>To use default named styles</h4>
<p>Default named styles can be applied the same way as headings (see <a
href="#chapter-005-microsoft-word-2011-mac.xhtml_word11-5">Technique
5</a>).</p>
<h2>Technique 7. Use Built-In Document Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting, such as
to position columns.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible. Whenever
possible, use just one row of headings.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>For more complicated tables, consider creating a text summary of the
essential table contents. Any abbreviations used should be explained in
the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (<em>e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and
quantity”</em>).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cell labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>Adding a table</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to Table (<em>top navigation bar</em>).</li>
<li>Under <strong>Table Options</strong> select
<strong>New</strong>.</li>
<li>In the “<strong>New</strong>” drop down menu drag the columns and
rows need.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Table.jpg" width="365" height="368"
alt="Image demonstrates how to insert a table." /><br />
<em>Note:</em> To style the table select the table on the page and
choose the design available in the <strong>Table Styles</strong>
panel.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Table1.jpg" width="633" height="64"
alt="Image demonstrates the location to add style to the table." /></li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> For later versions of Word for Mac,
the insert table functions are in found in the <strong>Insert</strong>
tab.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/word-mac-insert-table.png"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Insert tab where table styles can be found." /></p>
<p><em>Note:</em> <strong>Be sure to designate table
headers</strong><em>:</em> In the <strong>Table Design</strong> tab,
select the checkbox for <strong>Header Row</strong>, to indicate table
headings.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>7.2. Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select Home (<em>top navigation bar</em>).</li>
<li>Under <strong>Paragraph</strong> select the style (<em>e.g.,
bullets, number</em>).<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Paragraph.jpg" width="554" height="94"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of paragraph in the in the top navigation bar." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use Columns feature for placing text in columns. However, because
columns can be a challenge for users of some assistive technologies, you
should consider whether a column layout is really necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Page Breaks</h3>
<p>Start a new page by inserting a page break instead of repeated hard
returns.</p>
<h3>7.5 Use a Table of Contents</h3>
<p>Creating an index or table of contents to outline office document
content can provide a means of navigating the meaningful sequence of
content.</p>
<h4>To insert a table of contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor in your document where you want to create the table
of contents.</li>
<li><strong>Document Elements</strong> &gt; <strong>Table of
Contents</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> select the style you want
to use.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/TOC.jpg" width="622" height="93"
alt="Image locates the location of table of content." /><br />
<em>Note:</em> in order for the table of content to automatically set up
the user must change all the heading to Heading 1.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/TOC2.jpg" width="622" height="116"
alt="Image demonstrates the importance of changing the heading of the contents that will be on table of contents." /></li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note: </strong>In later versions of Word for Mac,

the <strong>References</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/word2016mac-update-TOC.png" alt="image" /></p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>7.6 Use Page Numbering</h3>
<p>Numbering the pages of your document helps those reading and editing
your document effectively navigate and reference its content. For users
of assistive technologies, it provides a valuable point of reference
within the document.</p>
<h4>Insert page numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong> &gt;<strong><strong>Page
Numbers…</strong></strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Page_number.jpg" width="193" height="145"
alt="Image locates &quot;page numbers&quot; under the insert drop down menu." /></li>
<li>In the <strong>Page Numbers</strong> dialog, select the page number
characteristics (<em>Position, Alignment, Show number on first
page</em>).</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note: </strong> For later versions of Word for
Mac, go to the <strong>Insert</strong> tab to find the <strong>Page
Number</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/word-mac-insert-page-number.png"
alt="Image locates the &quot;page number&quot; button under the Insert tab." /></p>
</div>
</div>
<h4>Formatting page numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the Page Numbers dialog, select <strong>Format…<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/Page_number2.jpg" width="447"
height="254"
alt="Image locates the format button on &quot;Page Numbers&quot; box." /></li>
<li>Select the format characteristics in the Page Number Format
dialog.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
<em>Note:</em> These changes are applied to the predefined page format
styles. It does not create a new page format style.</li>
</ol>
<h3>7.7 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change title</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong> &gt;
<strong><strong>Properties</strong></strong>.</li>
<li>In the Document <strong>Properties</strong> dialog, select
<strong>Summary</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter the title in the <strong>Title</strong> text box.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Title1.jpg" width="490" height="527"
alt="Image demonstrates the changes that should occur in the &quot;properties&quot; dialog box." /><br />
<em>Tip:</em> you can also fill in the subject, author and other
descriptions if necessary</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Make Charts Accessible</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>All basic accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest
of your document must also be applied to your charts and the elements
within your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color
alone, to convey information.
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind.</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply textures rather
than colors to differentiate the bars.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to
give users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret
the information.</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (<a
href="#chapter-005-microsoft-word-2011-mac.xhtml_word11-9.2">see
Technique 9.2</a>).</li>
<li>Consider providing the data that you used to create the chart in
tabular form (e.g. as an appendix).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<p>Here are some other things to keep in mind:</p>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 15 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span
id="chapter-005-microsoft-word-2011-mac.xhtml_word11-9.2"></span>9.2 Use
Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern. In order to determine whether the colors in your
document have sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast
checker, such as:</p>

</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Relying on Color or other Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>Content should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the
colour or shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the colour of text you have
edited and noting the colour. Instead use Word for Mac’s “Track Changes”
feature to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or colour combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colours, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings), it should occur consistently each
time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own.</p>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p><span id="chapter-005-microsoft-word-2011-mac.xhtml_tech11"></span>At
this time, Word 2011 for Mac does not offer a mechanism to check for
potential accessibility errors in your document prior to publishing.</p>

This icon highlights “curb cut” opportunities in these techniques. “Curb
cuts” are situations in which accommodations made for accessibility
reasons will also result in significantly better and more efficient
outcomes for everyone. The name comes from sidewalk “curb cuts” that
were added for people in wheelchairs, but are commonly used by people
with baby strollers, handcarts, wheeled luggage, and others.
</div>
<p>At the time of testing (September 30, 2010), Word 2010 provides a set
of accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the production of
accessible digital office documents. In addition, Word 2010 includes an
<a href="#chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_tech10">accessibility
checking feature</a>.</p>
<p>This guide is intended to be used for documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Word 2010 is <strong>Office Open XML
(DOCX)</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, Word 2010 offers many other word processor and web
format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for
accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are available
for the following formats in Technique 12 (below).</p>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or (2) Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility
of your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any
specific disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is
required, it is recommended that you test the office documents with end
users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</li>
<li>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Microsoft Word 2010 (ver.14.0.4762.1000, Windows XP, Aug.
2010) while creating a DOCX document.</li>
<li>This document is provided for information purposes only and is
neither a recommendation nor a guarantee of results. If errors are

<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd">
<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 Applicability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All success criteria</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>All office documents start with a template. These can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or complex nearly-complete document with
text, graphics and other content (e.g., a “Meeting Minutes” template).
Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_tech10">Technique 10. Check
Accessibility</a>).</p>
<p>Word 2010’s default template for new documents is a blank page. The
basic installation also includes blank business card, blank label
templates, and other blank office-related documents. These are all
accessible by virtue of being blank. It is possible to create your own
accessible templates.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> Updating templates is also a
good opportunity to improve document consistency, copy-editing, and
branding.
</div>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document (from the default blank template or from one
of the prepackaged templates).</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow all of the techniques in this document.</li>
<li>When you are finished, check the accessibility of the document (see
<a href="#chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_word1010">Technique 10.
Check Accessibility</a>)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Templates.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> list, select <strong>Word
Template.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive <strong>File name</strong> (e.g. “Accessible Memo
Template”) may increase the prominence of the accessibility status. As
well, filling in the text box labeled Tags with the term “accessibility”
may improve its discoverability as an accessible file.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save.<br />

height="511"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Templates folder, File name text box, and Save as type drop-down menu in the Save As dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p>Only use these steps if you have an accessible template available
(e.g., that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply open a new (blank)
document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New.</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Available Templates</strong>, select <strong>My
Templates.<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/MSWord2010_2.png" width="672"

<li>In the <strong>New</strong> document dialog, select your accessible
template from the list.</li>
<li>Select <strong><strong>OK.<br />
</strong></strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/MSWord2010_3.png" width="578"
height="362"
alt="Image demonstrates location of template icons in the Personal Templates gallery." /></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have
chosen an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point.</li>
<li><strong>As you add your content (e.g. text, images, etc.), ensure
that you consult the sections that follow to preserve
accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_word10-2"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 2. Specify Document Language</h2>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd">
<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 Applicability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3.1.1 Language of Page</li>
<li>3.1.2 Language of Parts</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, you must indicate the natural
(human) language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> The specified document
language is also used by the spelling and grammar checker. In Canada,
make sure to choose “English (Canada)” to avoid having to override
American spellings of words such as “colour.”
</div>
<p>To change the default language</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Options</strong> from the list in the left window
pane.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Language</strong> from the list in the left of the
<strong>Options</strong> dialog.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Choose Editing Languages</strong>, select the editing
language you want to use<em>Note:</em> to add an editing language,
select the language from the drop down list labeled “<strong>Add
additional editing languages</strong>.”</li>
<li>Select <strong>Set as Default.</strong></li>
<li>Close all Office 2010 programs and open them again for the changes
to take effect.<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSWord2010_4.png" width="711"
height="239"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Language option, Editing Language options, Set as Default button, and Add additional editing languages drop-down menu in the Options dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<p>Word 2010 has an automatic language detection mechanism, which can
automatically detect the language of your text. If you type a section of
text in a different language than the rest of your document, Word 2010
will programmatically mark the language of that section of text
appropriately.</p>
<h4>To turn on automatic language detection</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Review.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Language</strong> section, select the
<strong>Language</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Set Proofing Language.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Language</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Detect
language automatically</strong> check box.<br />

<li>Select the text.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Review.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Language</strong> section, select the
<strong>Language</strong> button.</li>

<h2>Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd">
<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 Applicability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.1.1 Non-text Content</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This is done by adding concise alternative text to of each image. If an
image is too complicated to concisely describe in the alternative text
alone (e.g. artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text alternative
and a longer description as well.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> Sometimes it may not be clear
what a particular image is meant to convey and alternative text can
provide that clarity. Also, alternate text has been shown to be included
in search engines rankings.
</div>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”.</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank.</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, include all of the text in
the alternative.</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences.</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g. for a chart or graph), provide
a short description in the alternative text (e.g. a summary of the
trend) and more detail in the long description, see below.</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”.</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g. an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone.</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the object.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Format Picture…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Alt Text</strong> option from the list.</li>
<li>Fill in the <strong>Description</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a Word 2010 document is saved to HTML, the <strong>Title</strong>
and <strong>Description</strong> fields are combined into a single entry
within the HTML &lt;alt&gt; tag. <strong>[Tested: September 30th,
2010]</strong></p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/MSWord2010_7.png" width="488" height="461"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Title and Description boxes in the Alt Text section of Format Picture dialog." /></p>
<p>When inserting a very small image, or resizing a larger image to be
much smaller, Word 2010 assumes that the image is intended to be a
bullet-point for a bulleted list. Once Word 2010 defines the image as a
bullet, the option to add alternative text disappears. Select
<strong>Undo</strong>, to redefine the bullet as an image. When you
right-click* the image, select <strong>Format Picture…</strong> and
select the <strong>Alt Text</strong> tab in the <strong>Format
Picture</strong> dialog. Alternative text can be found, or can be
entered, into the <strong>Alternative text</strong> box.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_word10-4"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 4. Avoid “Floating” Elements</h2>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd">
<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 Applicability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>When certain elements (e.g., images, objects, text boxes) are
inserted into Word 2010 documents they default to being an “inline
object”. Inline objects keep their position on the page relative to a
position in the text. This is beneficial for users of assistive
technologies (e.g., screen readers), because the screen reader can
simply read the object (or its alternative text) when it reaches that
point in the text flow, so the context is clear.</p>
<p>However, Word 2010 also provides the option to have these elements
“float” outside of the text order, with text flowing around, under or
over it. This is a problem for screen reader users because their screen
reader will often read the text (or alternative text) out of context,
which can be confusing. These text flow options should be avoided.</p>
<p>Similarly, avoid placing drawing objects such as arrows, lines and
shapes directly into the document (e.g. as borders, to create a
diagram). Instead, create borders with page layout tools and insert
complete graphical objects (e.g., pictures).</p>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> In-line elements are often
easier to work with than floating elements, which can end up being
shifted into strange positions as editing earlier parts of a document
cause re-pagination.
</div>
<h4>To prevent an image or object from “floating”</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the object.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Page Layout.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Position</strong> from the <strong>Arrange</strong>
section.</li>
<li>Select <strong>In Line with Text.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_word10-5"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Headings</h2>
<div style="margin: 1em 0;padding: 1em;border: 1px solid #ddd">
<p><strong>WCAG 2.0 Applicability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.3.1 Info and Relationships</li>
<li>2.4.1 Bypass Blocks</li>
<li>2.4.6 Headings and Labels</li>
<li>2.4.10 Section Headings</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Any documents that are longer than a few paragraphs require
structuring to make them easier for readers to understand. <strong>One
of the simplest ways to do this is to use “True Headings” to</strong>
create logical divisions between paragraphs. True headings are more than
just bolded, enlarged, or centered text; they are structural elements
that order and levels provide a meaningful sequence to users of
assistive technologies.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> Using true headings provides
several important benefits: (1) Headings are used by Word 2010 to
auto-generate a table of contents (see <a

<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> Using built-in structural
features is much more reliable that trying to use typography for
formatting (e.g. tabs to separate table cells, repeated new lines for a
page break).
</div>
<h3>6.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g. screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting, such as
to position columns.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g. “A sample order form
with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cell labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page (see <a
href="#chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_word10-4">Technique 4.
Avoid “Floating” Elements</a>).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To add a table with headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Tables</strong> section, select the
<strong>Tables</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Select the number of rows and columns you would like your table to
have.</li>
<li>Select the table and a <strong>Table Tools</strong> menu item should
appear.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Table Tools &gt; Design.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Table Style Options</strong> section, select the
<strong>Header Row</strong> check box<em>Note:</em> Whenever possible,
keep tables simple with just one row of headings.</li>
</ol>
<h3>6.2. Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph</strong> section, select the
<strong>Bullets</strong> icon for unordered lists or select the
<strong>Numbering</strong> icon for ordered lists.</li>
<li>To choose a different list format, select the arrow beside the
icon.</li>
<li>Select a format from the format <strong>Library</strong> that
appears in the drop-down menu.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify list styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph</strong> section, select the arrow beside
the <strong>Bullets</strong> icon for unordered lists or select the
arrow beside the <strong>Numbering</strong> icon for ordered lists.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Define New Bullet…</strong> to create a new unordered
list format.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Define New Number Format…</strong> to create a new
ordered list format.</li>
<li>In the <strong>New Bullet</strong> dialog or the <strong>New Number
Format</strong> dialog, select the list characteristics.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>6.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use the <strong>Columns</strong> feature for placing text in
columns.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Because columns can be a challenge for some users with
disabilities (e.g., people using magnifiers), consider whether a column
layout is really necessary.</p>
<h3>6.4 Page Breaks</h3>
<p>Start a new page by inserting a page break instead of repeated hard
returns.</p>
<h4>To add a page break</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Page Layout.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Page Setup</strong> section, select the arrow beside
the <strong>Breaks</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Select the type of break to add. <strong>Page break</strong> is used
to start a new page with the same page layout (page orientation,
headers, page numbering, etc.). <strong>Section break</strong> is used
if you want to start a new section of the document with a differing page
layout.</li>
</ol>
<h3><span
id="chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_word10-6.5"></span>6.5 Table
of Contents</h3>
<p>Creating an index or table of contents to outline office document
content can provide a means of navigating the meaningful sequence of
content.</p>
<p>The best way to generate a table of contents is after applying the
predefined heading styles, such as “Heading 1” as described above, to
the headings that you want to include in your table of contents. After
you apply these styles, you can then create a table of contents.</p>
<h4>To insert a table of contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor in your document where you want to create the table
of contents.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>References.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> section, select
<strong>Table of Contents.</strong></li>
<li>Select the style that you want to use.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To update a table of contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the table.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>References.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> section, select the
<strong>Update Table</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<h3>6.6 Page Numbering</h3>
<p>Numbering the pages of you document helps those reading and editing
your document effectively navigate and reference its content. For users
of assistive technologies, it provides a valuable point of reference
within the document.</p>
<h4>To insert page numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Header &amp; Footer</strong> section, select
<strong>Page Number.</strong></li>
<li>Select where you would like to insert your page numbers.</li>
<li>Select the style of page number you would like to use.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To format page numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Header &amp; Footer</strong> section, select Page
Number.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Format Page Numbers…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Page Number Format</strong> dialog, select the page
format characteristics you would like to use<br />
<em>Note:</em> These changes are applied to the predefined page format
styles. It does not create a new page format style.</li>
</ol>
<h3>6.7 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Info</strong> from the list in the left window
pane.</li>
<li>In the right window pane, select on the <strong>Title</strong> text
box.</li>
<li>Enter the <strong>Title</strong><em>Note:</em> The
<strong>Title</strong> defined in the properties is different than the
file name. It is also unrelated to the template name, discussed
above.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>1.1.1 Non-text Content</li>
<li>1.3.1 Info and Relationships</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>All basic accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest
of your document must also be applied to your charts and the elements
within your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color
alone, to convey information.
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind.</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply textures rather
than colors to differentiate the bars</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to
give users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret
the information.</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_word10-8.2">Technique 8.2
Use Sufficient Contrast</a>)</li>
<li>Consider providing the data that you used to create the chart in
tabular form (e.g., as an appendix).</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> If the chart data is also
provided in an appendix, it will be easier for all users to make use of
the data.

height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> All users will benefit from
content that is easier to see.
</div>
<h3>8.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) are
typically easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such as the pagination, the
layout of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h4>To change the text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, right-click* the
<strong>Style</strong> you wish to modify.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify Style.</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Formatting</strong> in the <strong>Modify</strong>
dialog box, select the appropriate font size.</li>
<li>Exit with <strong>OK.<br />

</ol>
<h3><span
id="chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_word10-8.2"></span>8.2 Use
Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such as
the <a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastAnalyser"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TPG Contrast Analyser</a> or
the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a>.</p>
<h3>8.3 Avoid Relying on Color or Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use Word 2010’s “Track Changes”
feature to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g. “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8.4 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g. to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_word10-9"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>

<h3>9.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<div class="textbox">
<img src="OEBPS/assets/curbcut-icon-xsm.png" width="23"
height="18" /><strong>Curb Cuts:</strong> By taking the time to design
your content in a consistent way, it will be easier to access, navigate
and interpret for all users.
</div>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g. headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own.</p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Type (or paste in) a web address and press spacebar or “Enter” to
convert into a hyperlink.</li>
<li>Select the link and right-click*.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Edit Hyperlink</strong> (Ctrl + K).</li>
<li>Edit the text in the <strong>Text to display</strong> box.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 10. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p><span id="chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_tech10"></span>If you
wish to check the accessibility of your document or template (see <a
href="#chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_word10-1">Technique 1. Use
Accessible Templates</a>), Word 2010 offers an “Accessibility Checker”
to review your document against a set of possible issues that users with
disabilities may experience in your file.</p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> No checker can detect all types of
accessibility issues. For example it can tell if alternative text is
missing, but it cannot tell if alternative text is actually correct. It
also doesn’t test for some issues, including colour contrast.</p>
<p>The Office website provides more information about the <a
href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Check-for-accessibility-issues-a16f6de0-2f39-4a2b-8bd8-5ad801426c7f"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accessibility Checker</a>,
including the rules it uses to identify and classify accessibility
issues.</p>
<p>The “Accessibility Checker” classifies issues as</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error</strong> – content that makes a file very difficult or
impossible for people with disabilities to understand</li>
<li><strong>Warning</strong> – content that in most, but not all, cases
makes a file difficult for people with disabilities to understand</li>
<li><strong>Tip</strong> – content that people with disabilities can
understand, but that might be better organized or presented in a way
that would maximize their experience</li>
</ul>
<h4>To use the “Accessibility Checker”</h4>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the file is saved as a DOCX (Older DOC files are not
compatible with the checker).</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File.</strong></li>

<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h4>Saving to PDF</h4>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a

<h2>Other Application Features</h2>
<h3><span
id="chapter-006-microsoft-word-2010.xhtml_word10-nav"></span>Word 2010’s
“Navigation” Feature</h3>
<p>After you have populated your document with content and true headings
have been applied, you may wish to rearrange the content. In order to
maintain the integrity and accessibility of the altered sequence, you
will need to ensure that structural information (e.g., heading levels)
is adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>Word 2010 provides a “Navigation” mechanism which displays all parts
of the document, such as headings, paragraphs, objects, etc. in
sequential order. It helps you navigate, access, and manipulate the
content. You can move headings or subordinate text up or down,
rearranging their sequence in a way that can be programmatically
determined and therefore accessible to assistive technologies.</p>
<h4>To use the “Navigation” feature</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Show</strong> section, select the <strong>Navigation
Pane</strong> check box.</li>
<li>The <strong>Navigation</strong> pane will open to the left of your
document.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To jump to a location in a document:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select one of three navigation options:
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Browse headings</strong> icon<br />
<em>Note:</em> select the heading to view hierarchical headings and
content below it.</li>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (January 26, 2011), Word 2008 for Mac lacks
several features that enable accessible office document authoring, most
notably: the ability to add alternative text to image and objects. As a
result, some of the other features that might otherwise support
accessibility, such as its extensive templates are not as effective. In
addition, Word 2008 for Mac does not include an accessibility checking
feature.</p>
<p>This guide is intended to be used for documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these
are specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Word for Mac is <strong>Office Open XML
(DOCX)</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, Word 2008 for Mac offers many other word processor and
web format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for
accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are available
for the following formats in <a
href="#chapter-007-microsoft-word-2008-for-mac.xhtml_word08-11">Technique
11</a> (below):</p>
<ul>
<li>DOC (MS Word 97–2004)</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Microsoft Word 2008 for Mac (ver.12.0.0 (071130), Mac OS
X, Jan. 2011) while creating a DOCX document. Files are also easily
saved as other file formats, which is useful for checking accessibility
(see <a
href="#chapter-007-microsoft-word-2008-for-mac.xhtml_tech-12">Technique
12</a>, below).</p>
<p>This document is provided for information purposes only and is
neither a recommendation nor a guarantee of results. If errors are
found, please report them to: <a
href="mailto:adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca">adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca</a>.</p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used.</p>
<p>Word for Mac’s default template for new documents is a blank page.
The basic installation also includes blank business card, blank label
templates, and other blank office-related documents. These are all
accessible by virtue of being blank.</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible templates from scratch
in Word for Mac. As well, you can edit and modify the existing
prepackaged templates, ensuring their accessibility as you do so and
saving them as a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document (from the default blank template or from one
of the prepackaged templates).</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document.</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (see <a
href="#chapter-007-microsoft-word-2008-for-mac.xhtml_word08-10">Technique
10</a>, below).</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save As</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive <strong>File name</strong> (e.g., “Accessible Memo
Template”) may increase the prominence of the accessibility status.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Format</strong> box, select <strong>Word
Template.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save.</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_1.png" width="606" height="445"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Save As box, Format drop-down list and Save button in Save As dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible
template available (e.g., that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply
open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Project Gallery…</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Category</strong>, select <strong>My
Templates</strong> (or select the location you saved your accessible
template).</li>
<li>Select the template from the scrolling gallery.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Open.</strong></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have
chosen an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text, images, etc.),
ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve
accessibility.</strong><br />

alt="Image demonstrates location of My Templates in Category section and an accessible template in the scrolling gallery of the Project Gallery dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Specify Document Language</h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h4>To change the default language</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools &gt; Language…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Language</strong> dialog, select the language.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Default…</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_3.png" width="311" height="314"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Default... button in Language dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools &gt; Language…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Mark selected text as</strong> box, select the
language from the list.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_4.png" width="311" height="344"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Mark selected text as list in Langauge dialog." /><br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>At this time, Word 2008 for Mac does not offer a mechanism which
enables the user to add alternative text descriptions to images or
objects. <strong>[Tested: January 26, 2011]</strong></p>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to of each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>

<h2>Technique 4. Avoid “Floating” Elements</h2>
<p>When images and objects are inserted into Word 2008 for Mac documents
they default to being an “inline object”. Inline objects keep their
position on the page relative to a portion of the text.</p>
<p>A “floating” object keeps its position relative to the page, while
text flows around it. As content moves up or down on the page, the
object stays where it was placed. To ensure that images and objects
remain with the text that references it, always position it as an inline
object.</p>
<p>Similarly, avoid placing drawing objects directly into the document
(e.g., as borders, to create a diagram). Instead, create borders with
page layout tools and insert complete graphical objects.</p>
<h4>To prevent an image or object from “floating”</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the object.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Picture…</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Layout.</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Wrapping style</strong>, select <strong>In Line with
Text</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/word2008forMac_5.png" width="510" height="373"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Layout option and In line with text option in Format Picture dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Headings</h2>
<p><span
id="chapter-007-microsoft-word-2008-for-mac.xhtml_tech5"></span>Any
documents that are longer than a few paragraphs require structuring to
make them more straightforward for readers to understand. <strong>One of
the easiest ways to do this is to use “True Headings” to</strong> create
logical divisions between paragraphs. True headings are more than just
bolded, enlarged, or centered text; they are structural elements that
order and levels provide a meaningful sequence to users of assistive
technologies.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for headings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the default headings styles provided (“Heading “, “Heading 2”,
etc.)</li>
<li>Nest headings properly (e.g., the sub-headings of a “Heading 1” are
“Heading 2”, etc.)</li>
<li>Do not skip heading levels</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To apply headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select text.</li>
<li>If the <strong>Formatting Palette</strong> is not in view, go to
menu item: <strong>View &gt; Toolbox, Formatting Palette.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Formatting Palette</strong>, if the
<strong>Styles</strong> section is not open, select
<strong>Styles.</strong></li>
<li>Headings can be found under <strong>Pick style to
apply.</strong></li>
<li>Select the heading you wish to apply.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_6.png" width="227" height="565"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Styles section and headings list under Pick style to apply in the Formatting Palette." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify heading styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>If the <strong>Formatting Palette</strong> is not in view, go to
menu item: <strong>View &gt; Toolbox, Formatting Palette.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Formatting Palette,</strong> if the
<strong>Styles</strong> section is not open, select
<strong>Styles.</strong></li>
<li>Headings can be found under <strong>Pick style to
apply.</strong></li>
<li>Select the menu icon beside the heading you want to modify.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify Style…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Modify Style</strong> dialog, make the appropriate
changes to style characteristics.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To create a new style</h4>
<ol>
<li>If the <strong>Formatting Palette</strong> is not in view, go to
menu item: <strong>View &gt; Toolbox, Formatting Palette.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Formatting Palette,</strong> if the
<strong>Styles</strong> section is not open, select
<strong>Styles.</strong></li>
<li>Headings can be found under <strong>Pick style to
apply.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>New Style…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> box, enter a name for the new
style.</li>
<li>Format the characteristics of the new style.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> and the new style will be added to the
<strong>Pick style to apply</strong> scrolling list.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_7.png" width="227" height="567"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Styles section and New Style... button in the Formatting Palette." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Use Named Styles</h2>
<p>As with “True Headings” (see <a
href="#chapter-007-microsoft-word-2008-for-mac.xhtml_word08-5">Technique
5</a>), you should attempt to make use of the named styles that are
included with the office application (e.g., “emphasis”, “caption”, etc.)
before creating your own styles or using the character formatting tools
directly. Named styles help your readers understand why something was
formatted in a given way, which is especially helpful when there are
multiple reasons for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use
italics for emphasis, Latin terms and species names).</p>
<p>For more information on formatting using named styles, see Technique
9.<br />
<em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in much
the same way, the named styles often differ.</p>
<h4>To use default named styles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Default named styles can be applied the same way as headings (see <a
href="#chapter-007-microsoft-word-2008-for-mac.xhtml_tech5">Technique
5)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 7. Use Built-In Document Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<div>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting, such as
to position columns.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible. Whenever
possible, use just one row of headings.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cell labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page (see <a
href="#chapter-007-microsoft-word-2008-for-mac.xhtml_word08-4">Technique
4</a>).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To add a table with headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Table &gt; Insert &gt; Table…</strong></li>
<li>Select the characteristics of the table and select
<strong>OK.</strong></li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Table &gt; Table Properties…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Table Properties</strong> dialog, select
<strong>Row.</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Options</strong>, select the <strong>Repeat as header
row at the top of each page</strong> check box</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_8.png" width="522" height="552"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Row option and Repeat as header row at the top of each page check box in Table Properties dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.2. Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text.</li>
<li>If the <strong>Formatting Palette</strong> is not in view, go to
menu item: <strong>View &gt; Toolbox, Formatting Palette.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Formatting Palette</strong>, select <strong>Bullets
and Numbering</strong> if it is not already open.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Bullets and Numbering</strong> dialog, select
<strong>Type, Bullets</strong> for bulleted lists or <strong>Type,
Numbering</strong> for numbered lists.</li>
<li>To change the style, select a list style from the
<strong>Style</strong> drop-down list.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_9.png" width="265" height="373"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Bullets and Numbering section in Formatting Palette." /></li>
</ol>
<p>At this time, it is not possible to modify pre-formatted list styles
or to create your own list styles. <strong>[Tested: January 26,
2011]</strong></p>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use <strong>Columns</strong> feature for placing text in columns.
However, because columns can be a challenge for users of some assistive
technologies, you should consider whether a column layout is really
necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Page Breaks</h3>
<p>Start a new page by inserting a page break instead of repeated hard
returns.</p>
<h3>7.5 Use a Table of Contents</h3>
<p>Creating an index or table of contents to outline office document
content can provide a means of navigating the meaningful sequence of
content.</p>
<p>The best way to generate a table of contents is after applying the
predefined heading styles, such as “Heading 1” as described above, to
the headings that you want to include in your table of contents. After
you apply these styles, you can then create a table of contents.</p>
<h4>To insert a table of contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor in your document where you want to create the table
of contents.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Document Elements &gt; Table of
Contents.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> section that opens above
the document pane, select the style you want to use.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_10.png" width="571" height="386"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Table of Contents section above the document pane in the application window." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To update a table of contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the table,</li>
<li>Select the icon beside <strong>Table of Contents,</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Update Table…</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_11.png" width="568" height="430"
alt="Image demonstrates Table of Contents menu as a result of selecting the icon beside Table of Contents." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.6 Use Page Numbering</h3>
<p>Numbering the pages of your document helps those reading and editing
your document effectively navigate and reference its content. For users
of assistive technologies, it provides a valuable point of reference
within the document.</p>
<h4>To insert page numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Page Numbers…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Page Numbers</strong> dialog, select the page number
characteristics (<strong>Position</strong>, <strong>Alignment</strong>,
<strong>Show number on first page</strong>),</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_12.png" width="480" height="246"
alt="Image demonstrates location of page number charactertistics options in Page Numbers dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To format page numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Page Numbers</strong> dialog, select
<strong>Format…</strong></li>
<li>Select the format characteristics in the <strong>Page Number
Format</strong> dialog.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
<li><em>Note:</em> These changes are applied to the predefined page
format styles. It does not create a new page format style.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_13.png" width="483" height="252"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Format... button in Page Numbers dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.7 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Document Properties</strong> dialog, select
<strong>Summary.</strong></li>
<li>Enter the <strong>title</strong> in the <strong>Title</strong> text
box.<strong><br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> The <strong>title</strong> defined in the
properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the
template name, discussed above.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_14.png" width="438" height="509"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Summary option and Title box in Document Properties dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>All basic accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest
of your document must also be applied to your charts and the elements
within your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color
alone, to convey information.
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind.</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply textures rather
than colors to differentiate the bars</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to
give users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret
the information.</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-007-microsoft-word-2008-for-mac.xhtml_tech92">Technique
9.2</a>).</li>
<li>Consider providing the data that you used to create the chart in
tabular form (e.g. as an appendix).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<p>Here are some other things to keep in mind:</p>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h4>To change the text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Formatting Palette.</strong></li>
<li>If the Styles section is not open, select
<strong>Styles</strong>.</li>
<li>Under Pick Style to the <strong>Style</strong> you wish to
modify.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify…</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Formatting</strong> in the <strong>Modify</strong>
dialog box, select the appropriate font size.</li>
<li>Exit with <strong>OK.</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_15.png" width="439" height="612"
alt="Image demonstrates location of size option in Formatting section of Modify Style dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.<br />
In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use Word 2008 for Mac’s “Track
Changes” feature to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g. “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own. To make the
address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the
address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Type (or paste in) a web address and press spacebar or “Enter” to
convert into a hyperlink.</li>
<li>Highlight the link.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Hyperlink…</strong></li>
<li>Edit the text in the <strong>Display</strong> box</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2008forMac_16.png" width="471" height="345"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Display box in Edit Hyperlink dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>At this time, Word 2008 for Mac does not offer a mechanism to check
for potential accessibility errors in your document prior to publishing.
<strong>[Tested: January 26th, 2011]</strong></p>
<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Before saving in other formats, you may want to run
the <strong>Compatibility Report</strong> feature by selecting
<strong>Compatibility Report…</strong> from the <strong>Save As</strong>
dialog. This checks the compatibility of your existing document with the
format you have selected save your document as. The results of this
check are revealed in the <strong>Compatibility Report</strong> dialog,
where you have explanations of errors and options to fix them. To run
this check at any time, go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Toolbox,
Compatibility Report</strong>.</p>
<h3>DOC</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save As</strong> box, type a name for the file.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Format</strong> box, select <strong>Word 97-2004
Document (.doc).</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>While Word 2008 for Mac allows you to save documents in the PDF
format. However, at this time, it does not offer an explicit option to
save your document in the tagged PDF format. <strong>[Tested: January
26th, 2011] </strong></p>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (January 10, 2011), Word 2007 provides a set
of accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the production of
accessible digital office documents. However, Word 2007 does not include
an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<p>This guide is intended to be used for documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Word 2007 is <strong>Office Open XML
(DOCX)</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, Word 2007 offers many other word processor and web
format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for
accessibility.</p>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility
of your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any
specific disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is
required, it is recommended that you test the office documents with end
users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</li>
<li>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Microsoft Word 2007 (ver.12.0.6545.5000, Windows 7, Jan.
2011) while creating a DOCX document. Files are also easily saved as
other file formats (see <a
href="#chapter-008-microsoft-word-2007.xhtml_word07-11">Technique
11</a>).</li>
<li>This document is provided for information purposes only and is
neither a recommendation nor a guarantee of results. If errors are
found, please report them to: <a
href="mailto:adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca">adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-008-microsoft-word-2007.xhtml_word07-11">Accessibility
Checking</a>, below).</p>
<p>Word 2007’s default template for new documents is a blank page. The
basic installation also includes blank business card, blank label
templates, and other blank office-related documents. These are all
accessible by virtue of being blank.</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible templates from scratch
in Word 2007. As well, you can edit and modify the existing prepackaged
templates, ensuring their accessibility as you do so and saving them as
a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document (from the default blank template or from one
of the prepackaged templates)</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (See <a
href="#chapter-008-microsoft-word-2007.xhtml_word07-10">Technique
10</a>, below)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; Word
Template</strong></li>
<li>Save the template in the <strong>Microsoft &gt; Templates</strong>
folder</li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive <strong>File name</strong> (e.g., “Accessible Memo
Template”) may increase the prominence of the accessibility status. As
well, filling in the text box labeled <strong>Tags</strong> with the
term “accessibility” may improve its searchability as an accessible
file.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2007_1.png" width="736" height="506"
alt="Image demonstrates location of File name, Save as type and Tags text boxes in the Save As dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible
template available (e.g. that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply
open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; New</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Templates</strong>, select <strong>My
templates…</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2007_2.png" width="909" height="444"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Templates section and My templates option in New Document dialog." /></li>
<li>In the <strong>New</strong> document dialog, select your accessible
template from the list in the <strong>My Templates</strong> tab<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2007_3.png" width="453" height="283"
alt="Image demonstrates location of My Templates tab and templates list in the New dialog." /></li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have
chosen an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text, images, etc.),
ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve
accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Specify Document Language</h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h4>To change the default language</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the operating system, activate the keyboard layout for the
language in which you want to create and edit text</li>
<li>Right-click* the status bar at the bottom of the window, ensure that
<strong>Language</strong> is selected, this displays a reminder of the
active keyboard layout in the status bar<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2007_4.png" width="496" height="322"
alt="Image demonstrates location of active keyboard reminder in the status bar of the application window." /></li>
</ol>
<p>Word 2007 has an automatic language detection mechanism, which can
automatically detect the language of your text. If you type a section of
text in a different language than the rest of your document, Word 2007
will programmatically mark the language of that section of text
appropriately.</p>
<h4>To turn on automatic language detection</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Review</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Proofing</strong> section, select the <strong>Set
Language</strong> button</li>
<li>In the <strong>Language</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Detect
language automatically</strong> check box<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2007_5.png" width="389" height="348"
alt="Image demonstrates location of the Detect language automatically check box in the Language dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Review</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Proofing</strong> section, select the <strong>Set
Language</strong> button</li>
<li>In the <strong>Mark selected text as</strong> box, select the
language from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2007_6.png" width="389" height="348"
alt="Image demonstrates location of the Mark selected text as language list in the Language dialog." /><br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to of each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
</section>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the object</li>
<li>Select <strong>Size…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Alt Text</strong> tab in the
<strong>Size</strong> dialog</li>
<li>Fill in the <strong>Alternative Text</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Close</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Word2007_7.png" width="417" height="467"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Alt Text tab, Alternative text box, and Close button in the Size dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<p>When inserting a very small image, or resizing a larger image to be
much smaller, Word 2007 assumes that the image is intended to be a
bullet-point for a bulleted list. Once Word 2007 defines the image as a
bullet, the option to add alternative text disappears. Select
<strong>Undo</strong>, to redefine the bullet as an image. When you
right-click* the image, select <strong>Format Picture…</strong> and
select the <strong>Alt Text</strong> tab in the <strong>Format
Picture</strong> dialog. Alternative text can be found, or can be
entered, into the <strong>Alternative text</strong> box.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-008-microsoft-word-2007.xhtml_word07-4"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 4. Avoid 'Floating' Elements</h2>
<p>When images and objects are inserted into Word 2007 documents they
default to being an “inline object”. Inline objects keep their position
on the page relative to a portion of the text. A “floating” object keeps
its position relative to the page, while text flows around it. As
content moves up or down on the page, the object stays where it was
placed. To ensure that images and objects remain with the text that
references it, always position it as an inline object.</p>
<p>Similarly, avoid placing drawing objects directly into the document
(e.g., as borders, to create a diagram). Instead, create borders with
page layout tools and insert complete graphical objects.</p>
<h4>To prevent an image or object from “floating”</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the object</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Page Layout</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Position</strong> from the <strong>Arrange</strong>
section</li>
<li>Select <strong>In Line with Text</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Headings</h2>
<p>Any documents that are longer than a few paragraphs require
structuring to make them more straightforward for readers to understand.
<strong>One of the easiest ways to do this is to use “True Headings”
to</strong> create logical divisions between paragraphs. True headings
are more than just bolded, enlarged, or centered text; they are
structural elements that order and levels provide a meaningful sequence
to users of assistive technologies.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for headings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the default headings styles provided (“Heading “, “Heading 2”,
etc.)</li>
<li>Nest headings properly (e.g., the sub-headings of a “Heading 1” are
“Heading 2”, etc.)</li>
<li>Do not skip heading levels</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To apply headings using the Styles toolbar</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select text</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, select the heading you wish
to apply<br />
<em>Note:</em> You can scroll through the multiple heading styles using
the arrows on the right side of the <strong>Styles</strong> section. You
can also change the <strong>Style</strong> design by selecting the
<strong>Change Styles</strong> button on the right.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify heading styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, right-click* the style you
wish to use from the <strong>Styles Gallery</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Modify Style</strong> dialog, make the appropriate
changes to style characteristics</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To return to the default heading styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, select <strong>Change
Styles</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Style Set</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Word 2007</strong> from the list</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Use Built-In Document Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>6.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting, such as
to position columns.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible. Whenever
possible, use just one row of headings.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cell labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page (see <a
href="#chapter-008-microsoft-word-2007.xhtml_word07-4">Technique
4</a>).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To add a table with headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Tables</strong> section, select the
<strong>Tables</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select the number of rows and columns you would like your table to
have</li>
<li>Select the table and a <strong>Table Tools</strong> menu item should
appear</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Table Tools &gt; Design</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Table Style Options</strong> section, select the
<strong>Header Row</strong> check box</li>
</ol>
<h3>6.2. Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph</strong> section, select the
<strong>Bullets</strong> icon for unordered lists or select the
<strong>Numbering</strong> icon for ordered lists</li>
<li>To choose a different list format, select the arrow beside the
icon</li>
<li>Select a format from the format <strong>Library</strong> that
appears in the drop-down menu</li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify list styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph</strong> section, select the arrow beside
the <strong>Bullets</strong> icon for unordered lists or select the
arrow beside the <strong>Numbering</strong> icon for ordered lists</li>
<li>Select <strong>Define New Bullet…</strong> to create a new unordered
list format</li>
<li>Select <strong>Define New Number Format…</strong> to create a new
ordered list format</li>
<li>In the <strong>New Bullet</strong> dialog or the <strong>New Number
Format</strong> dialog, select the list characteristics</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>6.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use <strong>Columns</strong> feature for placing text in columns.
However, because columns can be a challenge for users of some assistive
technologies, you should consider whether a column layout is really
necessary.</p>
<h3>6.4 Page Breaks</h3>
<p>Start a new page by inserting a page break instead of repeated hard
returns.</p>
<h3>6.5 Use a Table of Contents</h3>
<p>Creating an index or table of contents to outline office document
content can provide a means of navigating the meaningful sequence of
content.</p>
<p>The best way to generate a table of contents is after applying the
predefined heading styles, such as “Heading 1” as described above, to
the headings that you want to include in your table of contents. After
you apply these styles, you can then create a table of contents.</p>
<h4>To insert a table of contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor in your document where you want to create the table
of contents</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>References</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> section, select
<strong>Table of Contents</strong></li>
<li>Select the style that you want to use</li>
</ol>
<h4>To update a table of contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the table</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>References</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Table of Contents</strong> section, select the
<strong>Update Table</strong> button</li>
</ol>
<h3>6.6 Use Page Numbering</h3>
<p>Numbering the pages of your document helps those reading and editing
your document effectively navigate and reference its content. For users
of assistive technologies, it provides a valuable point of reference
within the document.</p>
<h4>To insert page numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Header &amp; Footer</strong> section, select
<strong>Page Number</strong></li>
<li>Select where you would like to insert your page numbers</li>
<li>Select the style of page number you would like to use</li>
</ol>
<h4>To format page numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Header &amp; Footer</strong> section, select
<strong>Page Number</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Format Page Numbers…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Page Number Format</strong> dialog, select the page
format characteristics you would like to use<br />
<em>Note:</em> These changes are applied to the predefined page format
styles. It does not create a new page format style.</li>
</ol>
<h3>6.7 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Prepare &gt;
Properties</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Document Properties</strong> section that appears,
select the <strong>Title</strong> text box</li>
<li>Enter the <strong>Title<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the
properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the
template name, discussed above.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 7. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>All basic accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest
of your document must also be applied to your charts and the elements
within your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color
alone, to convey information.
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind.</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply textures rather
than colors to differentiate the bars</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to
give users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret
the information.</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-008-microsoft-word-2007.xhtml_word07-92">Technique
9.2</a>)</li>
<li>Consider providing the data that you used to create the chart in
tabular form (e.g. as an appendix).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 8. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<p>Here are some other things to keep in mind:</p>
<h3>8.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h4>To change the text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, right-click* the
<strong>Style</strong> you wish to modify</li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify Style</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Formatting</strong> in the <strong>Modify</strong>
dialog box, select the appropriate font size</li>
<li>Exit with <strong>OK</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSWord2010_8.png" width="526" height="532"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Formatting options in the Modify Style dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.<br />
In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php"

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>8.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>8.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use Word 2007’s “Track Changes”
feature to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>8.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>9.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span
id="chapter-008-microsoft-word-2007.xhtml_word07-92"></span>9.2 Provide
Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own. To make the
address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the
address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Type (or paste in) a web address and press spacebar or “Enter” to
convert into a hyperlink</li>
<li>Select the link and right-click*</li>
<li>Select <strong>Edit Hyperlink</strong> (Ctrl + K)</li>
<li>Edit the text in the <strong>Text to display</strong> box</li>
</ol>
<p><span
id="chapter-008-microsoft-word-2007.xhtml_word07-10"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 10. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>At this time, Word 2007 does not offer a mechanism to check for
potential accessibility errors in your document prior to publishing.
<strong>[Tested: January 10th, 2011]</strong></p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document
or template, then you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in
order to perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as
described below.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>Save the document into HTML format and use one of the web
accessibility checkers available online, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Acrobat Professional</a></li>
<li><a

</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full
Check…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Full Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking
option.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Start Checking</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technique 11. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility.</p>
<p>To evaluate the accessibility of your PDF document, see below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the file is saved as a DOCX (Older DOC files are not
compatible with the checker).</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; PDF or
XPS</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Options</strong> button</li>
<li>Under <strong>Include non-printing information</strong>, ensure that
the <strong>Document structure tags for accessibility</strong> check box
is selected</li>
<li>Under <strong>PDF options</strong>, ensure that <strong>Bitmap text
when fonts may not be embedded</strong> check box is de-selected</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Save</strong><br />

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (September 30, 2010), Pages ’09 lacks several
features that enable accessible office document authoring, most notably:
the ability to add alternative text to image and objects. As a result,
some of the other features that might otherwise support accessibility,
such as its extensive templates are not as effective.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<strong>Editor’s note:</strong> In later versions of Pages, users have
the ability to add alt text to images and graphical objects. Apple has
added significant accessibility improvements to its iWork applications,
but an accessibility checker is not a feature yet.
</div>
</div>
<p>In addition, Pages does not include an accessibility checking
feature.</p>
<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using Pages to create
documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Pages is the native <strong>iWork
format</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, Pages offers many other word processor and web format
saving options. Most of these have not been checked for accessibility,
but some information and/or instructions are available for the following
formats in <a href="#chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-12">Technique
12</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MS Word</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using iWork Pages ’09 (ver.4.0.3 (766), Mac OS X, Sept. 2010)
and Pages (version 8.1) while producing a document in the native iWork
file format. Files are also easily saved as other file formats (see <a
href="#chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-12">Technique 12</a>).</p>
<p><span id="chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-1"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-11">Technique 11</a>).</p>
<p>The default template for new documents in Pages is a blank page. The
basic installation also includes blank letter templates and blank
business reports. These are all accessible by virtue of being blank.</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible templates from scratch
in Pages. As well, you can edit and modify the existing prepackaged
templates, ensuring their accessibility as you do so and saving them as
a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New</strong> or <strong>File &gt;
New from Template Chooser…</strong> (Shift+Apple+N).</li>
<li>In the <strong>Template Chooser</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Blank template</strong> or select one of the other existing
template designs.</li>
<li>A new document in your selected template style will open.</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document.</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (See Accessibility Checking, below).</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save as Template…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Export As</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive template name (e.g., “Accessible Memo Template”)
will increase the prominence of the accessibility status.</li>
<li>Specify a folder in which to save your template. To save the
template in a different location than the default, create a new folder
in the <strong>Templates</strong> folder. The folder name is then used
as a template category in the <strong>Template Chooser</strong>.<br />
Note: By default, it will be saved in your home folder in
Library/Application Support/iWork/Pages/Templates/My Templates pane of
the <strong>Template Chooser</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Pages09_1.png" width="312" height="245"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Export As box and the drop-down list to specify a folder in which to save the template." /></li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible
template available (e.g., that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply
open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New from Template
Chooser…</strong> (Shift+Apple+N).</li>
<li>In the <strong>Template Chooser</strong> dialog, select <strong>My
Templates</strong> from the left pane.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Pages09_2.png" width="282" height="279"
alt="Image demonstrates location of template icon in the Template Chooser dialog." /></li>
<li>Select your accessible template and click
<strong>Choose</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Specify Document Language</h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the text<br />
Note: To change the language of the entire document, do a select all to
select all the text in the document.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show Inspector</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Text</strong> button.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Text</strong> section, click the
<strong>More</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Language</strong> section, select the language from
the drop-down list.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Pages09_3.png" width="159" height="373"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Text button, More tab, and Language section in the Inspector dialog." /></li>
</ol>

<h2>Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>At this time, Pages ’09 does not offer a mechanism which enables the
user to add alternative text descriptions to images or objects.
<strong>[Tested: September 28, 2010]</strong></p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note: </strong>In later versions of Pages, users can
add alternative text descriptions for images and objects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the image to select it, then, in the <strong>Format</strong>
sidebar, click the <strong>Image</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Description</strong> text box, then enter your
text.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more details, see the section on how to <a
href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/pages/tanb3bc78786/mac"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add an image description</a>
in the Pages User Guide for Mac.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When  using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<p><span id="chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-4"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 4. Avoid “Floating” Elements</h2>
<p>Pages will default the position of an inserted image or object
depending on the method that is used to insert it. If you use a method
that requires you to simply drag-and-drop the image or object onto the
document, it will automatically be positioned as “floating”.</p>
<p>A “floating” object keeps its position relative to the page, while
text flows around it. As content moves up or down on the page, the
object stays where it was placed. To ensure that images and objects
remain with the text that references it, press the Command key and then
drag the image onto the document or follow the steps below.</p>
<h4>To import image as an inline object</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the insertion point wherever you want the image to
appear.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Choose.</strong></li>
<li>Select the image file.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Insert.</strong><br />
Note: You can always ensure your image or object is positioned with the
text that references it. Select the image or object, then go to the
<strong>Format</strong> bar and ensure that <strong>Inline</strong>
button is selected.</li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> For later versions of Pages, the
instructions for adding an image inline is slightly different:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Media</strong> button in the toolbar.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Photos</strong>, then drag an image from a photo
library to the page or to a media placeholder.</li>
</ol>

text</a> in the Pages User Guide for Mac.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span id="chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-5"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Headings</h2>
<p>Any documents that are longer than a few paragraphs require
structuring to make them more straightforward for readers to understand.
<strong>One of the easiest ways to do this is to use “true headings”
to</strong> create logical divisions between paragraphs. True headings
are more than just bolded, enlarged, or centered text; they are
structural elements that order and levels provide a meaningful sequence
to users of assistive technologies.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for headings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the default headings styles provided (“Heading “, “Heading 2”,
etc.)</li>
<li>Nest headings properly (e.g., the sub-headings of a “Heading 1” are
“Heading 2”, etc.)</li>
<li>Do not skip heading levels</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To apply headings to selected text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight selected text.</li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Format Bar</strong> and select the <strong>Choose
a paragraph style</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select the style you would like to apply from the drop-down
menu.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Pages09_4.png" width="145" height="305"
alt="Image demonstrates location of headings drop-down menu in the Format bar." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To create new heading styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight text and format with the characteristics you would like to
apply to a new heading.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Create New Paragraph Style from
Selection…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>New paragraph style</strong> dialog, enter a heading
style name in the <strong>Name</strong> text box.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note: </strong>For later versions of Pages, after
selecting text, follow these steps to create new heading styles:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the <strong>Format</strong> sidebar, click the paragraph style
name at the top of the sidebar.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>New Style</strong> button at the top of the
<strong>ParagraphStyles</strong> menu. A new style with a placeholder
name appears in the menu.</li>
<li>The <strong>Paragraph Styles</strong> menu with a callout to the
<strong>New Style</strong> button.</li>
<li>Type a name for the new style, then click outside the menu to close
it.</li>

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to create a paragraph
style</a> in the Pages User Guide for Mac.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Technique 6. Use Named Styles</h2>
<p>As with “True Headings” (see <a
href="#chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-5">Technique 5</a>), you
should attempt to make use of the named styles that are included with
the office application (e.g., “emphasis”, “caption”, etc.) before
creating your own styles or using the character formatting tools
directly. Named styles help your readers understand why something was
formatted in a given way, which is especially helpful when there are
multiple reasons for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use
italics for emphasis, Latin terms and species names).</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in
much the same way, the named styles often differ.</p>
<h4>To use default named styles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Default named styles can be applied the same way as headings (see <a
href="#chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-5">Technique 5)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-7"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 7. Use Built-In Document Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting, such as
to position columns.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cell labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page (see <a
href="#chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-4">Technique 4</a>).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To add a table with headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Position the cursor at the location in the document you would like
to add the table.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Table.</strong></li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show Inspector.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, select <strong>Table
inspector.</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Table</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Headers &amp; Footer</strong> section, click the
<strong>Choose the number of header columns</strong> button or the
<strong>Choose the number of header rows</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select the number of header rows or columns you would like your
table to have.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Pages09_5.png" width="203" height="146"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Table inspector, Table tab, and Headers &amp; Footer section in the Inspector dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.2. Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor where you would like to insert the list or
highlight the text of a list you already entered into your
document.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Toolbar</strong>, click the
<strong>Inspector</strong> button to show the inspector window.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, click the <strong>Text
inspector</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>List</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Bullets &amp; Numbering</strong> section, format your
list style using the drop-down menus.</li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note: </strong>In later versions of Pages, follow
these instructions to create an ordered or unordered list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the text you want to format.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Format</strong> sidebar, click the
<strong>Style</strong> button near the top.<br />
<em>Note:</em> If the text is in a text box, table, or shape, first
click the Text tab at the top of the sidebar, then click the
<strong>Style</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click the pop-up menu next to <strong>Bullets &amp; Lists</strong>,
then choose a list style.</li>

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to format a list</a> in
the Pages User Guide for Mac.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use <strong>Columns</strong> feature for placing text in
columns.<br />
<em>Note:</em> Because columns can be a challenge for users of some
assistive technologies, consider whether a column layout is really
necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Page Breaks</h3>
<p>Start a new page by inserting a page break instead of repeated hard
returns.</p>
<h3>7.5 Use a Table of Contents</h3>
<p>Creating an index or table of contents to outline office document
content can provide a means of navigating the meaningful sequence of
content.</p>
<p>The best way to generate a table of contents is after applying the
predefined heading styles, such as “Heading 1” as described above, to
the headings that you want to include in your table of contents. After
you apply these styles, you can then create a table of contents.</p>
<h4>To generate a Table of Contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Toolbar</strong>, click
<strong>Inspector.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, click the
<strong>Document</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>TOC</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select the checkboxes next to the paragraph styles whose text you
want to appear in the table of contents.</li>
<li>In the <strong>#’s</strong> column, select those paragraph styles
for which you want page numbers to appear.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Pages09_7.png" width="166" height="295"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Document button, TOC tab, and list of paragraph styles in the Inspector dialog." /></li>
<li>Place the insertion point at the beginning of the line where you
want the table of contents to appear<br />
Note: Table of contents created in Pages list only the content that
follows it, up until the next table of contents. To create a master
table of all the contents in your document, it must be the only table of
contents and must be placed at the beginning of the document.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Table of
Contents.</strong></li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> In later versions of Pages, follow
these instructions to generate a table:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you haven’t already done so, apply paragraph styles to the text
you want to appear in the table of contents.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>View</strong> menu button in the toolbar, then
choose <strong>Table of Contents</strong>.</li>
<li>Click Edit at the top of the sidebar, then select the paragraph
styles you want to include.</li>
<li>Place the insertion point where you want the table of contents to
appear, then do one of the following:
<ul>
<li><em>Add a TOC for the whole document:</em> Click the <strong>Insert
Table of Contents</strong> button at the bottom of the <strong>Table of
Contents</strong> sidebar. Entries are gathered from the entire
document.</li>
<li><em>Add a TOC for this section:</em> Choose <strong>Insert</strong>
&gt; <strong>Table of Contents</strong> &gt; <strong>Section</strong>.
Entries are gathered from only the section where you’re inserting the
table of contents.</li>
<li><em>Add a TOC for content up to the next TOC:</em> Choose
<strong>Insert</strong> &gt; <strong>Table of Contents</strong> &gt;
<strong>To Next Occurrence</strong>. Entries are gathered between this
table of contents and the next table of contents.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To format the text and add leader lines, click the table of contents
to select it. When the table of contents is selected, a blue line
appears around it and its text is highlighted in blue.</li>
</ol>

<li>In the <strong>Insert Page Numbers</strong> dialog, format the page
number using the available options.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Insert.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.7 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Toolbar</strong>, select
<strong>Inspector.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Document inspector</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Info</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Title</strong> box, type a descriptive name for the
document.<strong><br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the
properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the
template name, discussed above.<br />

<h2>Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience. All basic
accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your
document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within
your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color alone,
to convey information. As well, some further steps should be taken to
ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give
users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the
information.</p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Chart.</strong></li>
<li>Select a chart type from the list.</li>
<li>Update the <strong>Chart Data Editor</strong> with the data you
would like to display in the chart.</li>
<li>Close the <strong>Chart Data Editor.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the chart.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show Inspector.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Inspector</strong>, select
<strong>Chart.</strong></li>
<li>Ensure the <strong>Show Title</strong> and <strong>Show
Legend</strong> check boxes are selected.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Axis.</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Value Axis (Y)</strong> and <strong>Category Axis
(X)</strong>, select <strong>Show Title</strong> and <strong>Show Value
Labels</strong> from their respective drop-down menus.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To change to a different predefined Chart Type</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the chart.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show Inspector.</strong></li>
<li>Select a chart type from the <strong>Choose a chart type</strong>
drop-down menu.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind.</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply texture instead of
color to differentiate the bars.</li>
<li>Change the default colors to a color safe or gray-scale
palette.</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-9">Technique 9.2</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-9"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.<br />
In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a

<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online">Google
Search: gray-scale conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use Pages’ “Change Tracking”
functionality to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the steps noted in <a
href="#chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-3">Technique 3</a>.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own. To make the
address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the
address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Toolbar</strong>, click Inspector.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Link inspector</strong> button.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Hyperlink</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Make all hyperlinks inactive</strong>
checkbox.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Pages09_9.png" width="167" height="199"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Link inspector button, Hyperlink tab, and Make all hyperlinks inactive checkbox in the Inspector dialog." /></li>
<li>Edit the hyperlink text<br />
<em>Note:</em> While editing the hyperlink text, you have deactivated
all hyperlinks in the document. To reactive the hyperlinks, deselect the
<strong>Make all hyperlinks inactive</strong> checkbox.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Pages does not offer a mechanism to
check for potential accessibility errors in your document prior to
publishing. As well, it is not currently possible to export Pages
documents as HTML.</p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document
or template (see <a
href="#chapter-009-pages-for-mac.xhtml_pages-1">Technique 1</a>), then
you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order to perform an
accessibility check in one of those formats, as described below.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">

</div>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>Save the document into HTML format and use one of the web
accessibility checkers available online, such as:</p>
<ul>

<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"

<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when exporting to formats other
than the default.</p>
<p>At this time (December 2019), it is not possible to export Pages
documents as HTML files.</p>
<h3>PDF, Word, RTF, or plain text</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see Technique 11.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Export.</strong></li>
<li>Select the type of format you would like to export, click
<strong>Next.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save A</strong>s box, type a name for the
document.</li>
<li>Choose where you want to save the document.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export.<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> Exporting a plain text file removes all
formatting. Pages documents may not export identically in Word, due to
text layout differences.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>The techniques described in this document apply both to <a
href="http://www.openoffice.org/download" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenOffice Writer 3.4.0</a> and <a
href="http://www.libreoffice.org/download" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreOffice 4.0.4.2</a>. There are sometimes
minor differences in the toolbars and dialogs between the two office
suites, but these differences do not require different instructions.</p>
<p>At the time of testing (July 2013), Writer provides a set of
accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the production of
accessible digital office documents. An accessibility checking feature
is available by installing the <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/p/accessodf/wiki/UserGuide" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AccessODF extension</a>.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> For later versions of OpenOffice
Writer and LibreOffice, the accessibility checking features made
available through <strong>AccessODF</strong> is no longer stable (tested
on OpenOffice 4.1.7 and LibreOffice 6.3.1.2).</p>
<p>We recommended using other applications, such as current versions of
Microsoft Word, which has a robust suite of tools available for creating
accessible documents.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This guide is intended to be used for documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Writer is <strong>Open Document Text
(ODT)</strong>. In addition, Writer offers many other word processor and
web format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for
accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are available
for the following formats in <a
href="#chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_writer12">Technique
12</a>.</p>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<p>Several techniques refer to the <strong>Styles and
Formatting</strong> dialog. By default, this is a floating dialog but it
can also be docked, so it becomes a panel. When the dialog or panel is
open, keyboard users can navigate to it using the key F6. The same
applies to the <strong>Navigator</strong>, which can either float over
the editing area or be docked next to it.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility
of your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any
specific disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is
required, it is recommended that you test the office documents with end
users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</li>
<li>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Writer (ver. 3.4.0, Windows 7, 32 bits, July 2013) while
creating an ODT document.</li>
<li>This document is provided for information purposes only and is

</ul>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p><span id="chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_wrter1"></span>All
office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as a
blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting. Because templates provide the
starting-point for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you
are unsure whether a template is accessible, you should check a sample
document produced when the template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_writer11">Technique
11</a>).</p>
<p>Writer’s default template for new documents is a blank page. The
basic installation also includes blank business card and blank label
templates. These are all fairly accessible by virtue of being blank.
However, you should make the default language of a template unambiguous
(see <a
href="#chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_writer2">Technique
2</a>).</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible templates from scratch
in Writer. As well, you can edit and modify the existing prepackaged
templates, ensuring their accessibility as you do so and saving them as
a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document (either blank or from an existing
template).</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document.</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (See Accessibility Checking, below).</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties.</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> to
indicate the accessibility status of the template. Using
<strong>Title</strong> (e.g., “Accessible Memo Template”) will increase
the prominence of the accessibility status because this is used in place
of the template’s file name. <strong>Comments</strong> can be used to
add more information if necessary (e.g., “This memo template has been
checked for accessibility.”).<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOWriter1.png" width="555" height="443"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Title and Comments text box in Properties dialog." /></li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong>OK.</strong></li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Templates &gt;
Save.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>New Template</strong> box, type a name for the
template.</li>
<li>Select the category you would like to save it in, under
<strong>Categories.<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> the category is simply the folder into which you
are saving the template.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOWriter2.png" width="580" height="268"
alt="Image demonstrates location of New Template box and Categories options in the Templates dialog." /></li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p>Only use these steps if you have an accessible template available
(e.g. that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply open a new (blank)
document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Templates and
Documents.</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Templates</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Select a template document from the list.<br />
<em>Note:</em> A properties pane appears on the right side of the
window, where you can read the document properties (Title, By, Date,
Modified by, Modified on, Description, and Size). If you placed
information about the accessibility of the template in the
<strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> when you created
the template (see above), this will be displayed in the
<strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Description</strong>,
respectively.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOWriter3.png" width="662" height="454"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Templates icon, Title, and Description in the My Templates dialog." /></li>
<li>Select <strong>Open.</strong></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have
chosen an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text, images, etc.),
ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve
accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span
id="chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_writer2"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 2. Specify Document Language</h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h4>To select a language for the whole document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools &gt; Options.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Language Settings &gt; Languages.</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Default languages for documents</strong>, select the
document language for all newly created documents.<br />
<em>Note:</em> Writer uses three categories of languages: “Western
languages”, “Asian languages” and CTL languages (complex text layout).
For monolingual documents in a Western language, you should change the
values for Asian languages and CTL languages from their defaults to
“None”. Under default languages for documents, enable “Show UI elements
for UI elements for East Asian languages” and “Show UI elements for
Bi-Directional writing”. Then set the values for Asian and CTL to
“None”. You can then again disable the UI elements for these languages
again.<br />
<em>Tip:</em> Do this for all your templates.</li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong>OK.<br />
</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOWriter4.png" width="776" height="442"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Language option in Languages dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select a language for a paragraph style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor in the paragraph using the paragraph style you want
to edit.</li>
<li>Right-click* and go to menu item: <strong>Edit Paragraph
Style.</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Language</strong> and select
<strong>OK.</strong><br />
<em>Note:</em> All paragraphs formatted with the current paragraph style
will have the selected language.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOWriter5.png" width="555" height="461"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Language drop-down menu in Paragraph Style dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select a language for hyperlinks</h4>
<p>The default language of hyperlinks in Writer is “None”. If all or
most hyperlinks in a document are in the same language, you should
modify the style for hyperlinks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format</strong> &gt; <strong>Styles and
Formatting.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Character Styles</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Right-click* on the style <strong>Internet Link.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Set the language to <strong>English</strong> (or the Western
language that you use most). If the UI for non-Western languages is
enabled, set the non-Western languages to “None”.<br />
<em>Tip:</em> Set the language for the style Internet Link in all your
templates.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text to which you want to apply a language.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Character.</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Language.</strong></li>
<li>If the UI for non-Western languages is enabled, set the non-Western
languages to “None”.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2>Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>Some issues have been observed with Writer involving the loss of
alternative text and longer descriptions (e.g., when images anchored to
a paragraph are changed to anchor as characters, when a caption is
added). We suggest that you guard against this data loss by keeping
backups and by setting image anchoring and captions before adding the
alternative text.</p>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to of each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank.</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated.</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences.</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below.</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone.</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> When inserting a new image or object in place of an
existing image or object, the alternative text and description will
remain the same. This is helpful if you are inserting an updated version
of an image, whose meaning and context has not change. However, when
inserting an entirely new image or object, you will be required to
change the title and description fields accordingly.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> When inserting a picture or object that is too large
for the height or width of the page, it is best to reduce the size
before inserting it into the document. This results in a smaller file
size and usually better image quality.</p>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the object.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Picture.</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Options</strong> tab in <strong>Picture</strong>
dialog.</li>
<li>Fill in <strong>Alternative Text</strong> box.<br />
<em>Note:</em> the <strong>Alternative Text</strong> is also the
<strong>Title</strong> of the object.<br />

</ol>
<h4>To add long descriptions to images</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* on object.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Description…</strong> option.</li>
<li>Enter description in <strong>Description</strong> box.<br />

</ol>
<h2>Technique 4. Avoid “Floating” Elements</h2>
<p>When images and objects are inserted into Writer documents they
default to “floating” with an anchor “To Paragraph”. This makes them
difficult to select with the keyboard, so “floating” should be prevented
by anchoring them “As Character”.</p>
<p>A “floating” object keeps its position relative to the page, while
text flows around it. As content moves up or down on the page, the
object stays where it was placed. To ensure that images and objects
remain with the text that references it, always position it has attached
to a character at the end of the in-text reference.</p>
<p>Similarly, avoid placing drawing objects directly into the document
(e.g., as borders, to create a diagram). Instead, create borders with
page layout tools and insert complete graphical objects.</p>
<h4>To prevent an image or object from “floating”</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the object.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Anchor &gt; As Character</strong> option.</li>
</ol>
<p><span
id="chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_writer5"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Headings</h2>
<p>Any documents that are longer than a few paragraphs require
structuring to make them more straightforward for readers to understand.
<strong>One of the easiest ways to do this is to use “True Headings”
to</strong> create logical divisions between paragraphs. True headings
are more than just bolded, enlarged, or centered text; they are
structural elements that order and levels provide a meaningful sequence
to users of assistive technologies.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for headings</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the default headings styles provided (“Heading “, “Heading 2”,
etc.).</li>
<li>Nest headings properly (e.g., the sub-headings of a “Heading 1” are
“Heading 2”, etc.).</li>
<li>Do not skip heading levels.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To apply headings from the Formatting Toolbar</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the text that you want to make into a navigational
heading.</li>
<li>Select the desired heading from the dropdown list in the
<strong>Formatting Toolbar.</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOWriter8.png" width="188" height="224"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Heading drop-down menu in Formatting toolbar." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply headings using the Styles and Formatting panel</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the text that you want to make into a navigational
heading.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and
Formatting.</strong></li>
<li>Double-click* the desired heading style.<br />
<em>Note:</em> If a heading style is modified in the <strong>Styles and
Formatting</strong> panel, the modification will apply to every heading
of that style.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply headings using keyboard shortcuts (up to Heading 5)</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the text that you want to make into a navigational
heading.</li>
<li>Select Ctrl+1 (for Heading 1), Ctrl+2 (for Heading 2), … Ctrl+5 (for
Heading 5).</li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify heading styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting</strong>
(F11).</li>
<li>Select the style to modify from the list.</li>
<li>Right-click* and select: <strong>Modify…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph Style</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Organizer</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> box, enter a unique style name.</li>
<li>Format the heading style using the available formatting options in
the various tabs. Make sure your selections align with the techniques in
this document.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Use Named Styles</h2>
<p>As with “True Headings” (see <a
href="#chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_writer5">Technique
5</a>), you should attempt to make use of the named styles that are
included with the office application (e.g., “emphasis”, “caption”, etc.)
before creating your own styles or using the character formatting tools
directly. Named styles help your readers understand why something was
formatted in a given way, which is especially helpful when there are
multiple reasons for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use
italics for emphasis, Latin terms and species names).</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in
much the same way, the named styles often differ.</p>
<p>Writer provides named “paragraph styles” for “caption”, “endnote”,
etc. Styles for strong emphasis, emphasis, source code and quotations
are not paragraph styles but “character styles”. You can access
character styles by selecting the <strong>Character Styles</strong> icon
in the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> dialog.</p>
<h4>To use default named styles</h4>
<ul>
<li>Default named styles can be applied the same way as headings (see <a
href="#chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_writer5">Technique
5</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 7. Use Built-In Document Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting, such as
to position columns.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible.</li>
<li>Always set the header to show at the top of each page. Also set the
table to break between rows instead of in the middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cell labels should be concise and clear.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To add a table with headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Table</strong> (Ctrl+F12).</li>
<li>Enter a name for the table.</li>
<li>Specify the number of columns and rows in the table.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Heading</strong> check box.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Repeat heading</strong> check box.</li>
<li>Indicate the number of rows you want to use for the heading in
<strong>The first…rows</strong> spinner box.<br />
<em>Note:</em> Whenever possible, keep tables simple with just 1 row of
headings.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOWriter9.png" width="580" height="339"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Heading check box, Repeat heading option, and The first...rows spinner box in the Insert Table dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add table headings manually</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the table cells that should be headers.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt;Styles and Formatting</strong>
(F11).</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Heading</strong> check box and make sure that
<strong>Repeat heading</strong> is checked.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To make tables break between rows instead of in the middle of
rows</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor inside the table.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Table</strong> &gt; <strong>Table
Properties.</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Text Flow</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Unselect the check box <strong>Allow row to break across pages and
columns.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.2. Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<p>This applies a paragraph style for lists that makes sure that
assistive technology and other software can recognize the content as a
list.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select text.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and
Formatting.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> dialog, select a list
style such as List 1 or Numbering 1.<br />
<em>Note:</em> Do not select the style “List”: this style is reserved
for modifying all list styles or numbering styles at once.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two methods for adding visual list formatting to this list:
the first one modifies the applied paragraph style:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format</strong> &gt; <strong>Styles and
Formatting.</strong></li>
<li>Right-click* the paragraph style you applied to the content (e.g.,
List 1 or Numbering 1).</li>
<li>Select <strong>Modify…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph Style</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Outline &amp; Numbering</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Numbering Style</strong> (this drop-down list also
contains styles for unordered lists).</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Indents and Spacing</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Set the indent values you would like to use for this list type.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The second method changes the visual formatting of a list without
changing all lists based on the same style:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the list</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format</strong> &gt; <strong>Bullets and
Numbering.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Bullets and Numbering</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Bullets</strong> tab for unordered lists or the
<strong>Numbering</strong> <strong>type</strong> tab for ordered
lists.</li>
<li>Select a list style from the <strong>Selection</strong>
gallery.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To create sublists</h4>
<p>This is the only way to create a true sublist (i.e. a list that is
(internally) a child list of the list item above it) instead of a list
that is merely indented more from the margin.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the list items that should become a sublist.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Bullets and Numbering</strong> toolbar, select the
button <strong>Demote One Level</strong> or the button <strong>Demote
One Level with Subpoints.</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOWriter-sublists.png" width="400" height="52"
alt="Image demonstrates location of &#39;demote one level&#39; and &#39;demote one level with sublists&#39; buttons on the &#39;bullets and numbering&#39; toolbar." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To create new list styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and
Formatting.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>List Styles</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Right-click* a style from the list.</li>
<li>Select <strong>New…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Numbering Style</strong> dialog, enter a name for the
list style in the <strong>Name</strong> box.</li>
<li>Format the list using the available formatting options in the
various tabs.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> This does not create new paragraph styles but new
formatting styles that you can apply to paragraph styles for lists. Even
though the names for the formatting styles (List 1, Numbering 1 etc.)
that appear when you select the List Styles icon are the same as some of
the paragraph styles that appear when you select the Paragraph Styles
icon, their purpose is different: the Paragraph Styles are for document
structure and other paragraph features (e.g. indent), the List Styles
are for the numbering or bullet style.</p>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use the <strong>Columns</strong> feature for placing text in
columns.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Because columns can be a challenge for users of some
assistive technologies, consider whether a column layout is really
necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Page Breaks</h3>
<p>Start a new page by inserting a page break instead of repeated hard
returns.</p>
<p>To insert a page break, use the shortcut Ctrl + Enter or go to the
menu item <strong>Format</strong> &gt; <strong>Manual Break</strong> and
select <strong>Page Break</strong> (the default option).</p>
<h3>7.5. Use a Table of Contents</h3>
<p>Creating an index or table of contents to outline office document
content can provide a means of navigating the meaningful sequence of
content.</p>
<p>The best way to generate a table of contents is after applying the
predefined heading styles, such as “Heading 1” as described above, to
the headings that you want to include in your table of contents. After
you apply these styles, you can then create a table of contents.</p>
<h4>To insert a Table of Contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select in your document where you want to create the table of
contents.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Indexes and Tables &gt; Indexes
and Tables.</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Index/Table</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Table of Contents</strong> in the
<strong>Type</strong> dropdown.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To use a different paragraph style as a Table of Contents entry</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select in your document where you want to create the table of
contents.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Indexes and Tables &gt; Indexes
and Tables.</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Index/Table</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Table of Contents</strong> in the
<strong>Type</strong> box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Create from</strong> area, select the
<strong>Additional Styles</strong> check box.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>(…)</strong> button next to the check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Assign Styles</strong> dialog, select the style in
the list.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> or the
<strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> button to define the outline level for the
paragraph style.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To update a Table of Contents</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Tools &gt; Update &gt; All Indexes and
Tables.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.6 Use Page Numbering</h3>
<p>Numbering the pages of your document helps those reading and editing
your document effectively navigate and reference its content. For users
of assistive technologies, it provides a valuable point of reference
within the document.</p>
<h4>To Insert Page Numbers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Footer.</strong></li>
<li>Select the page style that you want to add the footer to. If you
have not created or applied any special page styles, “Default” will be
the only option.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Fields &gt; Page
Number.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience.</p>
<ul>
<li>All basic accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest
of your document must also be applied to your charts and the elements
within your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color
alone, to convey information.
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind.</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply textures rather
than colors to differentiate the bars.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to
give users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret
the information.</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_writer92">Technique
9.2</a>).</li>
<li>Consider providing the data that you used to create the chart in
tabular form (e.g., as an appendix).</li>
</ul>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Object &gt;
Chart…</strong></li>
<li>Right-click* the chart and select <strong>Chart Data
Table…</strong></li>
<li>Update the data table with the data you would like to display.</li>
<li>Close the data table.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the chart.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Titles.</strong></li>
<li>Update the relevant fields and select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Data Labels.</strong></li>
<li>Configure your data label selections and select
<strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply textures to bar charts</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the chart’s legend, right-click* on the <strong>Legend
Key</strong> for one of the bars.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Format Data Series…</strong></li>
<li>In the Fill area, select <strong>Hatching</strong> and choose one of
the textures.</li>
<li>Optionally, select the <strong>Background Color</strong> check box
and choose a color.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat these steps for each legend key.</p>
<h4>To change the line style in line charts</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the line chart’s legend, right-click* on the <strong>Legend
Key.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Format Data Series…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Line</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Choose a line style that will help distinguish the data series from
the other lines in the chart.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Repeat these steps for each legend key.</p>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<p>Here are some other things to keep in mind:</p>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Verdana, Helvetica,
Arial) may sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New
Roman, Garamond).<br />
<em>Note:</em> Some fonts were specifically designed for easier reading
on screens (e.g. the sans-serif fonts Verdana, Trebuchet MS and Calibri,
and the serif fonts Georgia, Cambria and Constantia). Unfortunately,
many of these fonts are not available across operating systems.</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated (e.g., blinking) text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h4>To change the text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting</strong>
(F11).</li>
<li>Select the style to modify from the list.</li>
<li>Right-click* and select: <strong>Modify…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select a font size under <strong>Size.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOWriter10.png" width="555" height="461"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Font tab and Size option in Paragraph Style dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3><span
id="chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_writer92"></span>9.2 Use
Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.<br />
In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastAnalyser"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TPG Contrast Analyser</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Relying on Color or Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead, use Writer’s “Changes” feature to
track changes. You can find this feature in the <strong>Edit</strong>
menu.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted in <a
href="#chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_writer3">Technique
3</a>, above.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own.</p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Position the cursor where you would like to enter the link.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Hyperlinks.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Hyperlink</strong> dialog, enter the link address in
the <strong>Target</strong> box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Further settings</strong> section, enter the text to
display in the <strong>Text</strong> box.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Apply.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Close.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span
id="chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_writer11"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of your document or template
(see <a
href="#chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_wrter1">Technique
1</a>), download the AccessODF extension and install it using Writer’s
Extension Manager (<strong>Tools &gt; Extension Manager…</strong>). This
extension offers an “Accessibility Evaluation” function to review your
document against a set of possible issues that users with disabilities
may experience in your file.</p>
<p>AccessODF classifies issues as either:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error:</strong> Content that makes a file very difficult or
impossible for people with disabilities to understand.</li>
<li><strong>Warning:</strong> Content that in most, but not all, cases
makes a file difficult for people with disabilities to understand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To Use AccessODF</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility
Evaluation…</strong></li>
<li>An Accessibility Evaluation task panel will open.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Check</strong> to start the evaluation.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/accessODF.png" width="333" height="685"
alt="Image of the AccessODF Accessibility Evaluation task panel as it appears on the side of a document that contains numerous errors." /></li>
<li>Select a specific issue to see its description and repair
suggestions. If the <strong>Repair</strong> button becomes active,
selecting this button will either repair the issue automatically or open
the dialog where you can repair the issue. (For example, adding a text
alternative to an image cannot be done automatically, so AccessODF opens
the dialog for text alternatives.) If the issue is a false alarm, select
the <strong>Ignore</strong> button.</li>
<li>When you have repaired all the issues, select the
<strong>Check</strong> button again to find issues that may have gone
undetected so far.</li>

<h3>Using HTML and PDF to Evaluate Accessibility</h3>
<p>Since the AccessODF plugin may not work with current versions of
OpenOffice or LibreOffice, consider saving the document as an HTML or
PDF file and check those formats for accessibility. This will allow you
to get some indication of the accessibility of your document or
template.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>Save the document into HTML format and use one of the web
accessibility checkers available online, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Acrobat Professional</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://commonlook.com/accessibility-software/pdf-validator"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CommonLook PDF
Evaluator</a></li>

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF Accessibility Checker
(PAC)</a> – a free alternative provided by “Access for all”</li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full
Check…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Full Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking
option.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Start Checking</strong> button.</li>

<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a
href="#chapter-010-openoffice-libreoffice.xhtml_writer">Technique
11</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Export as PDF.<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> This option is different than the <strong>Adobe
PDF</strong> option in the <strong>Print</strong> dialog.</li>
<li>The <strong>PDF Options</strong> dialog window opens.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>General</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select the check box labeled <strong>Tagged PDF</strong><br />
<em>Note:</em> You must ensure this option is selected in the PDF
Options window dialog box before using PDF icon on menu bar. This option
is not checked by default, but will remain checked once you have
selected it.</li>
<li>Select the check box labeled <strong>Export bookmarks.<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> This creates a hierarchical list of bookmarks
that link to the document’s headings. This list is displayed in the
bookmarks panel of Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader and facilitates
navigation (for sighted users) in large documents.</li>
<li>Optionally, select the <strong>Initial View</strong> tab; in the
<strong>Panes</strong> area, select the radio button <strong>Bookmarks

<h2>Other Application Features</h2>
<h3>Writer’s “Navigator” Feature</h3>
<p>After you have populated your document with content and true headings
have been applied, you may wish to rearrange the content. In order to
maintain the integrity and accessibility of the altered sequence, you
will need to ensure that structural information (e.g., heading levels)
is adjusted accordingly.</p>
<p>Writer provides a “Navigator” mechanism which displays all parts of
the document, such as headings, tables, frames, objects or hyperlinks.
These elements are referred to as “categories”. If a plus sign appears
next to any one of the categories, it means there is more than one
object of its kind within the document.</p>
<p>The “Navigator” feature helps you navigate document content, as well
as access and manipulate the content. This enables you to move headings
or subordinate text up or down in a document, as well as promote or
demote heading levels. Arranging objects and other elements of the
document is possible as well, following the same principle as arranging
headings and text. This allows you to apply a meaningful sequence that
can be programmatically determined and therefore accessible to assistive
technologies.</p>
<h4>To open the “Navigator”</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>View</strong> tab from the menu bar (F5).</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Navigator</strong> option.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To jump to a location in a document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Double-click* an item listed in the <strong>Navigator</strong>
window, or enter the respective page number in the spin box.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOWriter11.png" width="297" height="356"

</ol>
<h4>To open a category</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the plus sign beside the category.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOWriter12.png" width="297" height="357"
alt="Image demonstrates how some of the categories in the navigator are collapsed and can be expanded." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To view only the entries in a certain category</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the category and select the <strong>Content View</strong>
icon.<em><br />
Note:</em> Until you select the icon again, only the objects of this
category will be displayed.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOWriter13.png" width="283" height="64"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the content view button in the toolbar." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To move heading up or down in a document</h4>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Standard Bar</strong>, select the Navigator icon to
open the Navigator.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Navigator</strong>, select the <strong>Content
View</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Do one of the following:
<ol>
<li>Drag a heading to a new location in the Navigator list.</li>
<li>Select a heading in the Navigator list, and then select the
<strong>Promote Chapter</strong> or <strong>Demote Chapter</strong>
icon.</li>
<li>To move the heading without the subordinate text, hold down Ctrl
while you drag or select the <strong>Promote Chapter</strong> or
<strong>Demote Chapter</strong> icons.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h4>To Promote or Demote the Level of a Heading</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the heading in the Navigator list</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Promote Level</strong> or <strong>Demote
Level</strong> icon</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (December 2019), <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Sheets</a> lacks some features that
enable accessible office document authoring, most notably: the ability
to indicate changes in natural language, programmatically determined
named styles, and a separate document title field.</p>
<p>No accessibility checking feature is built into Google Sheets;
however, you can install a third-party add-on called <a
href="https://www.grackledocs.com/grackle-sheets-accessible-spreadsheets"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Sheets</a>. Grackle is
a third-party plug-in that includes an accessibility checker along with
other features that enhance accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-003-google-docs.xhtml#gdoc11">Technique 11</a>). Due to
the nature of Google Sheets, some accessibility features, such as
tables, are only fully accessible when exporting the document to another
format, like an HTML file.</p>
<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using Google Sheets to
create documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity),</li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>Google Sheets does not have a default file format, as it is a
web-based authoring tool.</p>
<p>Google Sheets offers various spreadsheet processor and web format
saving options. Most of these have not been checked for accessibility,
but some information and/or instructions are available for the following
formats in <a href="#chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheet12">Technique
12</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Excel (.xlsx)</li>
<li>OpenDocument Format (.ods)</li>
<li>PDF Document (.pdf)</li>
<li>HTML (.html, zipped)</li>
<li>Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet)</li>
<li>Tab-separated values (.tsv, current sheet)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong> . In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users. Files are also easily saved
as other file formats (see <a
href="#chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheet12">Technique 12</a>).</p>

<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>Google Sheets lacks support for some accessibility features, such as
table headers that repeat. With this in mind, be cautious of templates
available in the Google Sheets template gallery and be sure that they
comply the techniques discussed here.</p>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheet11">Technique 11</a>).</p>
<p>Google Sheets’s default template for new documents is a blank
spreadsheet. The basic installation also includes a wide variety of
templates ranging from blank service invoices to blank project
management schedules. These are all accessible by virtue of being
blank.</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own templates from scratch in Google
Sheets. As well, you can edit and modify the existing templates,
ensuring their accessibility as you do so and saving them as a new
template.</p>
<h4>To select a template</h4>
<ol>
<li> Go to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Sheets</a>.</li>
<li>At the top right, click on <strong>Template Gallery</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gsheet-template-gallery.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1872" width="728" height="224"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Template gallery on the Google Sheets home page." /></li>
<li>Select a template.</li>
<li>A copy of the template will open.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new spreadsheet (from the default template or from an
existing template).<br />
<em>Note: </em>If creating a template from an existing document, go
to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Make a copy</strong>. Type a name
and choose where to save it, then, click <strong>Ok</strong>.</li>
<li>Rename your document. Be sure to indicate that the document is an
accessible template by using terms such as “accessible” (e.g.,
“Accessible Memo Template”). This will improve its searchability and
promote its use as an accessible template.</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow techniques in this document. You may also
check the accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheet11">Technique 11</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h4>To share your accessible template as a new document</h4>
<p>You can share your accessible template, but it may be more useful to
share the file as copy that other users can add to their Google
Drive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the address bar change the end of the URL before sending
it.</li>
<li>Replace “edit” at the end of the URL with “copy”.<br />
<em>For example:<br />
<strong>Before:</strong> </em>http://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/d/12345678/<strong>edit</strong><br />
<em><strong>After:</strong></em> http://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/d/12345678/<strong>copy</strong></li>
<li>Send the modified copy link.</li>
<li>When the recipient follows the modified copy link, they’re
instructed to click on <strong>Make a copy</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gsheets-copy-template.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1873" width="634" height="260"
alt="Image demonstrates the Copy Document message that appears when a recipient follows your modified copy link of your document&#39;s address." /><br />
</li>
<li>They can then work on a copy of the accessible template.</li>
</ol>

rel="noopener noreferrer">Google: Share “Make a copy” links to your
files</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 2. Set Document Language</h2>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Google Sheets does not offer an
explicit language selection mechanism to indicate the natural language
of your spreadsheet or changes in natural language at any point within
the content (e.g., a few cells containing text in a different language
than the rest of the spreadsheet). Google Sheets defaults the natural
language to the language selected for your Google Account (see <a
href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/187189" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google: Change Your Typing Language</a>).</p>
<p>When exporting to other document formats, there is no guarantee that
the natural language of your Google Account will be indicated as the
natural language of your document. In order for assistive technologies
(e.g., screen readers) to be able to present your document accurately,
it is important to indicate the natural language of the document. If a
different natural language is used for a paragraph or selected text,
this also needs to be clearly indicated.</p>
<h2>Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>Google Sheets offers a mechanism for adding alternative text or
longer descriptions to images and objects where it can be readily
accessed by screen reader users. While you can add alt text, you will
need to ensure that you provide longer descriptions in the body of the
document, near the images and objects. While this solution is not
optimal for screen reader users and will complicate your own
accessibility testing, it is necessary until long descriptions are
supported.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<h4><em>To add alternative text to images and graphical
objects </em></h4>
<h5>For images in a cell</h5>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* on the image.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Alt Text</strong> from the contextual menu.<br />

<h2>Technique 4. Format Your Cells</h2>
<p>As you begin adding content, your spreadsheet will require
structuring to bring meaning to the data, make it easier to navigate,
and help assistive technologies read it accurately. One of the easiest
ways to do this is to ensure that you properly format the cells.</p>
<h3>4.1 Named Styles</h3>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Google Sheets does not offer named
styles functionality.</p>
<p>You should make use of the named styles that are included with the
office application (e.g., “Heading”, “Result”, etc.) before creating
your own styles or using the character formatting tools directly. Named
styles help your readers understand why something was formatted in a
given way, which is especially helpful when there are multiple reasons
for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use italics for emphasis,
Latin terms and species names).</p>
<p>For more information on formatting using named styles, see <a
href="#chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheet9">Technique 6</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in
much the same way, the named styles often differ.</p>
<p>Formatting header and result cells brings order to the spreadsheet
and makes it easier for users to navigate effectively. For example, you
can format header rows and columns using “Heading” styles to apply
bolded, enlarged, and italicized text (among other characteristics). You
may also want to format cells containing results of calculations to
appear bold and underlined to help distinguish them from the rest of
your data.</p>
<h3>4.2 Other Cell Characteristics</h3>
<p>Ensure your cells are formatted to properly represent your data,
including number and text attributes.</p>
<h4>To format cell characteristics</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells that you want to format<br />
<em>Note:</em> to format a row or column, select the row or column
indicator and follow the next steps</li>
<li>Go to the menu icon bar</li>
<li>Select the icon or drop-down list for the format you would like to
apply (e.g., <strong>Format as currency</strong>, <strong>Format as
percent</strong>, <strong>More formats</strong>)<br />
<em>Note:</em> When formatting your spreadsheet, it is best to avoid
merging cells. At times, it may seem easier to present your data by
merging cells, but this can make it more difficult for users of
assistive technologies and people navigating your spreadsheet using the
keyboard.<br />

numbers in a spreadsheet</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Cell Addressing</h2>
<h3>5.1 Define Names</h3>
<p>Naming the different data ranges within your spreadsheet makes it
easier to navigate through the document and find specific information.
By associating a meaningful name to a data range, you will be enhancing
the readability of your document. These named ranges can be referenced
in multiple locations of your document and within calculations and
equations.</p>
<h4>To define a name</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the cells you would like to name</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Data &gt; Named ranges</strong>. A menu
will open on the right.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gsheets-named-ranges.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1877" width="248" height="588"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Named Ranges function in the Data menu." /></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em">Type the range name you want (see <a
href="#chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_range-names">Range Names</a>,
below). </span></li>
<li>To change the range, click the Spreadsheet Grid icon.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gsheet-named-ranges-menu.png"
class="alignnone wp-image-1878 size-full" width="300" height="215"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Range Name text box and data range option in Range names sidebar." /></li>
<li>Select a range in the spreadsheet or type the new range into the
text box, then click <strong>Ok</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Done</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox">
<p><strong><span
id="chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_range-names"></span>Range
names:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores.</li>
<li>Can’t start with a number, or the words “true” or “false.”</li>
<li>Can’t contain any spaces or punctuation.</li>
<li>Must be 1–250 characters.</li>
<li>Can’t be in either A1 or R1C1 syntax. For example, you might get an
error if you give your range a name like “A1:B2” or “R1C1:R2C2.”</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>Edit or delete a named range</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Data</strong>, then <strong>Named
ranges</strong>.</li>
<li>On the named range you want to edit or delete, click
<strong>Edit</strong>.
<ul>
<li><em>To edit the range:</em> Enter a new name or range, then click
<strong>Done</strong>.</li>
<li><em>To delete the named range:</em> Next to the name, click
<strong>Delete range</strong>. On the menu that opens, click
<strong>Remove</strong>.</li>
<li><em>Note:</em> When you delete a named range, any formulas that
reference it will no longer work. Protected ranges that reference a
named range will use the cell values and continue to work.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Spreadsheet applications support various types of charts, which can
be used to display your spreadsheet data in meaningful ways for your
audience. It is important to ensure that your chart is as accessible as
possible to all members of your audience. All basic accessibility
considerations that are applied to the rest of your document must also
be applied to your charts and the elements within your charts. For
example, use shape and color, rather than color alone, to convey
information. As well, some further steps should be taken to ensure that
the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give users
reference points that will help to correctly interpret the
information.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Chart</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Editor</strong> , a data range has been
pre-selected and will appear in the box labeled Data. (Note: If this
range is incorrect, enter a new range in the box labeled
<strong>Data</strong> . To update the data range by manually
highlighting the cells, select the <strong>Select range…</strong> link.
This opens the <strong>What data?</strong> dialog, which allows you to
highlight the data range and select <strong>OK</strong> .)</li>
<li>In the <strong>Chard Editor</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Use
row 1 as headers</strong> check box if the first row of your data is a
header row</li>
<li>Select the chart type from the <strong>Recommended charts</strong>
section</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Customize</strong> tab</li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart section</strong> , enter a title for the chart
in the <strong>Chart title</strong> box</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Name</strong> link and enter a name for the chart
in the <strong>Chart name</strong> box</li>
<li>In the <strong>Axis</strong> section, enter a title for the vertical
axis in the <strong>Vertical name</strong> box</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Horizontal</strong> link and enter a title for
the horizontal axis in the <strong>Horizontal name</strong> box</li>
<li>Define any other available options that may be associated with the
chart</li>
<li>Select <strong>Insert</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>Double-click on the chart you want to change.</li>
<li>At the right, click <strong>Customize</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Series</strong>.<br />
<em>Optional:</em> Next to “Apply to,” choose the data series you want
to add a label to.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Data labels</strong>.<br />
<em>Optional:</em> Under “Position,” choose where you want the data
labels to show.<br />
<em>Optional:</em> Make changes to the label font.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add alternative text to a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the top right corner of the chart, click on the three dots.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gsheets-alt-text-menu.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1884" width="158" height="260"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the three-dots and the menu item of Alt Text." /></li>
<li>From the drop-down menu, select <strong>Alt text</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Description</strong> field type or paste appropriate
alt text.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gsheets-alt-text-300x213.png"
class="alignnone wp-image-1885 size-medium" width="300" height="213"
alt="Image demonstrates the Alt Text menu where a description can be added for a chart." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind</li>
<li>Change the default colors to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheet9">Technique 9</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 7. Provide Structure for Tables</h2>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Google Sheets does not include an
“Insert Table” feature.</p>
<p>If you use the <a
href="https://www.grackledocs.com/grackle-sheets-accessible-spreadsheets"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Sheets</a> add-on,
tables can be given structure and table headings can be indicated. While
these fixes won’t be useful for making tables more accessible in Google
Sheets, it does allow you to export the document into another format
with appropriate table tags intact. For more on Grackle Sheets, see <a
href="#chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheet11">Technique 11</a>.</p>
<h2>Technique 8. Use Other Content Structuring Features</h2>
<p>While cell formatting is the most common method of structuring
documents, other content structuring features should be used where
appropriate:</p>
<h3>8.1 Add a Document Title</h3>
<p>At this time, Google Sheets makes use of a single document name.
Within Google Sheets, this serves well as a title, but when exporting to
ODT, the document name is used to form the file name and the ODT “Title”
properties field is left blank.</p>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into another format (e.g.,
HTML or PDF), it should be given a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the file name of the current document</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Rename</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Rename Document</strong> dialog, enter a new document
name</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2 Avoid “Floating” Elements</h3>
<p>Avoid “floating” elements (other than charts) such as floating
images, objects, tables or text boxes. Similarly, avoid placing drawing
objects directly into the document (e.g., as borders, to create a
diagram). Instead, create borders with page layout tools and insert
complete graphical objects.</p>
<p>To learn how to insert images and graphical object into Google
Sheets, see <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9224754"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google: Add an image to a
spreadsheet</a>.</p>
<h3>8.3 Use Descriptive Sheet Names</h3>
<p>In Google Sheets, spreadsheets have the default name “Sheet1” and so
on. To improve the accessibility and navigability of your spreadsheets,
follow these recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name sheets with a sheet name that describes its content.</li>
<li>Delete unused sheets to avoid unnecessary navigation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>To rename a spreadsheet</h4>
<ol>
<li>At the bottom of your Google Sheet, click on the drop-down arrow
beside the sheet name.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gsheet-rename-tab.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1909" width="303" height="418"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Rename function in the sheet title&#39;s context menu." /><br />
<em>Note:</em> Alternately, you can double click on the sheet name.</li>
<li> Type a descriptive name for your sheet and
hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gsheet-rename-sheet.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1910" width="228" height="106"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the sheet title when renaming a sheet." /></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheet9"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to be
printed, try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for cell contents.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change document details such the pagination, the layout of
tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a reasonable
degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.<br />
In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php"

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use Google Sheets’s review
functionality features to track changes, such as revision history.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g. ,“the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Navigational Instructions</h3>
<p>Provide a general description of the spreadsheet contents and
instructions on how to navigate the data effectively. The best way to do
this is to make a cell at the beginning of the data (e.g., A1) with this
information. It will be the first cell accessed by assistive
technologies. If you are using this cell for a label or data, you can
attach a comment note to the cell containing navigational
instructions.</p>
<h3>10.3 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own.</p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Link.</strong> Alternately, you
can select the text you’d like to add a link to and press Ctrl+K (or
Cmd+K on Macs).</li>
<li>In the pop-up box, enter descriptive text in the
<strong>Text</strong> display box.</li>
<li>Enter the link address in the <strong>Link</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong><strong>Apply</strong></strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gdoc-link.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1868" width="457" height="142"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Text to display box and Link address box." /></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheet11"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Google Sheets does not offer a
mechanism to check for potential accessibility errors in your document
prior to publishing. However, a third-party add-on called <a
href="https://www.grackledocs.com/grackle-sheets-accessible-spreadsheets"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Sheets</a> can be used
to check the accessibility of your workbook (see below).</p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document
or template (see <a
href="#chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheets1">Technique 1</a>), then
you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order to perform an
accessibility check in one of those formats (see <a
href="#chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheets-evaluate-a11y">Evaluating
the Accessibility in Other Formats</a>).</p>
<h3><span
id="chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheets-grackle-sheets"></span>Grackle
Sheets</h3>
<p><strong>What is Grackle Sheets?</strong><a
href="https://www.grackledocs.com/grackle-sheets-accessible-spreadsheets"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Sheets</a> is a
third-party add-on that runs on spreadsheets created in Google Sheets.
It helps with checking and improving the digital accessibility of your
document. Due to the nature of Google Sheets, some accessibility
features, such as tables, are only fully accessible when exporting the
document to another format, like an HTML file.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong> After Grackle is launched, It
scans the current spreadsheet for accessibility issues and identifies
and locates errors. Feedback appears in a sidebar that is docked on
right-side of the screen. By exploring the sidebar, you can immediately
learn about accessibility issues and find and fix the detected errors by
interacting with the Grackle sidebar.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Grackle’s accessibility checker is free to use;
however, the ability to export and produce accessible HTML spreadsheets,
and so on, is only free for the first 30 days (as of December 2019).</p>
<p>At the time of testing, Grackle Sheets performs the following 13
accessibility checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sheets
<ul>
<li>Sheets document needs a proper title</li>
<li>Sheet names should be descriptive</li>
<li>The number of sheets should be reasonable</li>
<li>Avoid making sheets too large</li>
<li>Sheets should not be empty</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tables
<ul>
<li>Tables should have headers</li>
<li>Tables should not be too long</li>
<li>The number of tables should be reasonable</li>
<li>The use of merged cells is not recommended</li>
<li>Avoid isolated cells</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Charts
<ul>
<li>Charts should have alternate text</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Contents
<ul>
<li>High color contrast should be used</li>
<li>Fine print should be avoided</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h3>Share a presentation in HTML view</h3>
<p>When using Google Slides’ HTML view, your  whole presentation is
displayed in a single, scrollable HTML page, instead of displaying the
presentation one slide at a time. This is a helpful feature if your
audience includes people who use screen readers.</p>
<p>To access a presentation in HTML view, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl
+ Alt + Shift + p (Windows or Chrome OS) or ⌘ + Option + Shift + p
(Mac).</p>
<h3>Export to alternate formats</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Download as</strong></li>
<li>Select the file type</li>
</ol>
<h4>PDF</h4>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a
href="#chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheet11">Technique 11</a>.</p>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;
tags</li>
<li>Check for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-011-google-sheets.xhtml_gsheet11">Technique 11</a>)<br />
<em>Note:</em> you may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help
with this process.</li>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (December 2019), Excel 2010 and later versions
provide a set of accessibility features that are sufficient to enable
the production of accessible digital office documents. In addition,
Excel includes an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<h3>How to Create an Accessible Office Document</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using Excel to create
documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity),</li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these
are specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Excel is <strong>Office Open XML
(XSLX)</strong>. In addition, Excel offers many other spreadsheet
processor and web format saving options. Most of these have not been
checked for accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are
available for the following formats in Technique 12 (below):</p>
<ul>
<li>MS Excel</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Microsoft Excel 2010 (ver.14.0.4760.1000, Windows XP,
Sept. 2010)  and Microsoft Excel included with Office 365 while creating
a XLSX document. Files are also easily saved as other file formats (see 
<a href="#chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml_excel2010-12">Technique
12</a>, below).</p>
<p><span id="chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml_excel2010-1"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 1: Using Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting. Because templates provide the
starting-point for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you
are unsure whether a template is accessible, you should check a sample
document produced when the template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml_excel2010-11">Technique 11</a>,
below).</p>
<p>Excel’s default template for new documents is a blank page. The basic
installation also includes other blank office-related documents. These
are all accessible by virtue of being blank.</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible templates from scratch
in Excel. You can also edit and modify the existing prepackaged
templates, ensuring their accessibility as you do so and saving them as
a new template.</p>
<h4>How to Create an Accessible Template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document.</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document.</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (see <a
href="#chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml_excel2010-11">Technique 11</a>,
below).</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> list, select <strong>Excel
Template</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive <strong>File name</strong> (e.g., “Accessible
Inventory Template”) will increase the prominence of the accessibility
status. Also, filling in the text box labeled Tags with the term
“accessibility” will improve its searchability as an accessible
file.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong>.<br />

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video about finding and
exploring features of accessible Excel templates</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h4>Selecting an Accessible Template</h4>
<p>Only use these steps if you have an accessible template available
(e.g. that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply open a new (blank)
document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Available Templates</strong>, select <strong>My
Templates</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-1A.jpg" width="634" height="288"
alt="Image demonstrates location of New option and My templates icon in the File menu." /></li>
<li>In the <strong>New</strong> document dialog, select your accessible
template from the list.</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-1B.jpg" width="612" height="386"
alt="Image demonstrates location of template icons in Personal Templates section of the New dialog." /></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have
chosen an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text, images, etc.),
ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve
accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2: Setting the Document Language</h2>
<p>At this time (December 2019), it is not possible to indicate the
natural language of selected cells within an Excel workbook.</p>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h4>How to Change the Default Language for a Workbook</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Options</strong> from the list in the left window
pane.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Language</strong> from the list in the left of the
<strong>Options</strong> dialog.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Chose Editing Languages</strong>, select the editing
language you want to use.<br />
<em>Note:</em> to add an editing language, select the language from the
drop down list labeled. <strong>[Add additional editing
languages]</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Set as Default</strong>.</li>
<li>Close all Office programs and open them again for the changes to
take effect.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-2_0.jpg" width="750" height="246"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Language option, Editing languages list, Set as Default button and Add additional editing languages option in Options dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 3: Providing Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text (use “Description” in Excel)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank.</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated.</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below.</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions (use “Description” in
Excel)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone.</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<p> </p>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the object.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Format Picture…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Alt Text</strong> option from the list.</li>
<li>Fill in the <strong>description</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-3_2.jpg" width="501" height="470"
alt="Image demonstrate location of Title box and Description box in Format Picture dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<p>If an Excel document is saved to HTML, the <strong>Title</strong> and
<strong>Description</strong> fields are combined into a single entry
within the HTML &lt;alt&gt; tag.</p>

<h2>Technique 4. Format Your Cells</h2>
<p>As you begin adding content, your spreadsheet will require
structuring to bring meaning to the data, make it easier to navigate,
and help assistive technologies read it accurately. One of the easiest
ways to do this is to ensure that you properly format the cells.</p>
<h3>4.1 Named Styles</h3>
<p>You should make use of the named styles that are included with the
office application (e.g., “Heading”, “Result”, etc.) before creating
your own styles or using the character formatting tools directly. Named
styles help your readers understand why something was formatted in a
given way, which is especially helpful when there are multiple reasons
for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use italics for emphasis,
Latin terms and species names). For more information on formatting using
named styles, see <a
href="#chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml_excel2010-9">Technique
9</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in
much the same way, the named styles often differ.</p>
<p>Formatting header and result cells brings order to the spreadsheet
and makes it easier for users to navigate effectively. For example, you
can format header rows and columns using “Heading” styles to apply
bolded, enlarged, and italicized text (among other characteristics). You
may also want to format cells containing results of calculations to
appear bold and underlined to help distinguish them from the rest of
your data.</p>
<h4>To format a cell with default named styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells that you want to format<br />
<em>Note:</em> to apply a style to an entire row or column, select the
row or column indicator and follow the next steps</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, select the <strong>Cell
Styles</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Select the desired formatting style from the drop-down menu.<br />
<em>Note:</em> To modify a style, right-click* the desired formatting
style from the drop-down menu and select <strong>Modify</strong>.
Changes made to the style will affect all instances of the style within
your workbook.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4.2 Other Cell Characteristics</h3>
<p>Ensure your cells are formatted to properly represent your data,
including number and text attributes.</p>
<h4>To format cell characteristics</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells that you want to format</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong>.</li>
<li>In the relevant sections (e.g., <strong>Numbers</strong>,
<strong>Font</strong>, etc.) make your adjustments.<br />
<em>Note:</em> When formatting your spreadsheet, it is best to avoid
merging cells. At times, it may seem easier to present your data by
merging cells, but this can make it more difficult for users of
assistive technologies and people navigating your spreadsheet using the
keyboard.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Cell Addressing</h2>
<h3>5.1 Define Names</h3>
<p>Naming the different data ranges within your spreadsheet makes it
easier to navigate through the document and find specific information.
It can also be use as a navigation. When using the shortcut
<strong><strong>Ctrl + G</strong></strong> a dialog box will open and
layout all the names define in the cells. When selected and the OK
button is pressed it will navigate to the located place.</p>
<p>By associating a meaningful name to a data range, you will be
enhancing the readability of your document. These named ranges can be
referenced in multiple locations of your document and within
calculations and equations.</p>
<h4>To define a name</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells you would like to name.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Formulas</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Defined Names</strong> section, select the
<strong>Define Name</strong> button.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> text box, enter the name for the data
range</li>
<li>In the <strong>Scope</strong> drop-down list, select scope within
which the name can be referenced</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-5_2.jpg" width="317" height="237"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Name box and Scope option in New Name dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience. All basic
accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your
document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within
your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color alone,
to convey information. As well, some further steps should be taken to
ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give
users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the
information.</p>

</div>
</div>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the data that you want to include in the chart</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Charts</strong> section, select the icon of the type
of chart you would like to insert</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Chart Type</strong> from the <strong>Chart
Gallery</strong> in the drop-down menu</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu item:
<strong>Layout</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Labels</strong> section, select the type of title or
label you would like to define (e.g., <strong>Chart Title, Axis Titles,
Data Labels</strong>)<br />
<em>Note:</em> It is a good idea to use as many of the titles and labels
available in this section as possible.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a predefined Chart Layout</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu item:
<strong>Design</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Layouts</strong> section, select a
<strong>Quick Layout</strong> from the scrolling <strong>Chart
Layouts</strong> gallery</li>
</ol>
<h4>To change to a different predefined Chart Type</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu item:
<strong>Design</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Type</strong> section, select the <strong>Change
Chart Type</strong> icon</li>
<li>In the <strong>Change Chart Type</strong> dialog, select a chart
type from the left pane</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Chart Design</strong> from the right pane</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply alternative text to a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the chart<br />
<em>Note:</em> Make sure you are right-clicking the whole chart, not
just an element within the chart. It is possible to add descriptions to
the many elements that make up a chart, but this is not
recommended.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Format Chart Area</strong> dialog, select <strong>Alt
Text</strong></li>
<li>Enter a <strong>Title</strong> in the <strong>Title</strong>
box</li>
<li>Enter a longer description of the chart contents in the
<strong>Description</strong> box</li>
<li>Select <strong>Close</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Other chart considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml_excel2010-9">Technique 9</a>,
below)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Selecting charts with the keyboard:</h4>
<p>You can select charts from selection pane.<br />
This can be launched with keyboard sequence ALT+H,FD,P</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>ALT+H</strong> and release the buttons<img
src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-6_0.jpg" width="980" height="110"
alt="Image demonstrates the hidden pane." /></li>
<li>Type press <strong>FD<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-6A.png" width="236" height="262"
alt="Image demonstrates the hide selection pane." /></li>
<li>Then Type <strong>P<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-6B.jpg" width="142" height="358"
alt="Image demonstrates the selection and visibility panel." /></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a toggle command, so if the selection pane is already
visible, it gets hidden after this.</p>
<p>When the selection pane is active, by default the first object (chart
or shape) will be highlighted. You can select it by pressing enter or
tab to move to other options or use the arrow keys.</p>
<h2>Technique 7. Provide Structure for Tables</h2>
<p>Excel includes an “Insert Table” feature, but this works by applying
cell formatting to spreadsheet cells. As such, it is not a structural
feature in the same way that tables are in Word and PowerPoint.</p>
<h2>Technique 8. Use Other Content Structuring Features</h2>
<p>While cell formatting is the most common method of structuring
documents, other content structuring features should be used where
appropriate:</p>
<h3>8.1 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Info</strong> from the list in the left window
pane</li>
<li>In the right window pane, select the <strong>Title</strong> text
box</li>
<li>Enter the <strong>Title</strong><br />
<em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the properties is
different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the template name,
discussed above.</li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2 Avoid “Floating” Objects</h3>
<p>Avoid placing drawing objects directly into the document (e.g., as
borders, to create a diagram). Instead, create borders with page layout
tools and insert complete graphical objects.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml_excel2010-9"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for cell contents.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h4>To change the text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, select the <strong>Cell
Styles</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select the style to modify from the list</li>
<li>Right-click* and select: <strong>Modify…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Style</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Format</strong> button<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-9.jpg" width="276" height="331"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Format button in Style dialog." /></li>
<li>In the <strong>Format Cells</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Font</strong> tab</li>
<li>In the <strong>Size</strong> text box, type the desired size or
select it from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-9A.jpg" width="512" height="458"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Font tab and Size option in Format Cells dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern. In order to determine whether the colors in your
document have sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast
checker, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use Google docs: Spreadsheet’s
review functionality features to track changes, such as revision
history.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g. “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Navigational Instructions</h3>
<p>Provide a general description of the spreadsheet contents and
instructions on how to navigate the data effectively. The best way to do
this is to make a cell at the beginning of the data (e.g., A1) with this
information. It will be the first cell accessed by assistive
technologies. For example, the first cell might read: “This worksheet
includes two data tables. The first begins at cell A1 and lists travel
expenses. The second begins at cell A50 and lists moving expenses.”</p>
<p><span id="chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml_excel2010-11"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of your document or template
(see <a href="#chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml_excel2010-1">Technique
1</a>, above), Excel offers an “Accessibility Checker” to review your
document against a set of possible issues that users with disabilities
may experience in your file.</p>
<h4>The “Accessibility Checker” classifies issues as</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error</strong> – content that makes a file very difficult or
impossible for people with disabilities to understand</li>
<li><strong>Warning</strong> – content that in most, but not all, cases
makes a file difficult for people with disabilities to understand</li>
<li><strong>Tip</strong> – content that people with disabilities can
understand, but that might be better organized or presented in a way
that would maximize their experience</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about the Accessibility Checker and the rules it uses
to identify and classify accessibility issues in your document, visit
the Excel help section (see Accessibility Help, below). Use the search
term “accessibility checker rules” in the help search box.</p>
<h4>To use the “Accessibility Checker”</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Info</strong> in the left window pane</li>
<li>Under <strong>Prepare for Sharing</strong>, an alert will appear if
a potential accessibility issue has been detected</li>
<li>To view and repair the issues, select <strong>Check for
Issues</strong> and then <strong>Check Accessibility<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-11A.jpg" width="479" height="407"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Check Accessibility option in Check for Issues drop-down menu." /><br />
</strong></li>
<li>An <strong>Accessibility Checker</strong> task pane will open,
showing the inspection results<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-11B.jpg" width="201" height="184"
alt="Image demonstrates inspection results in Accessibility Checker task pane." /></li>
<li>Select a specific issue to see <strong>Additional
Information</strong></li>
<li>Follow the steps provided to fix or revise the content<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-11C.jpg" width="200" height="568"
alt="Image demonstrates additional information for inspection results in Accessibility Checker pane." /></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to get further indication of the accessibility of your
document or template (see <a
href="#chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml__Toc284929347">Technique
1</a>), then you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order
to perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as described
below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>Another option is to save the document into HTML format and use one
of the web accessibility checkers available online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Acrobat Professional</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://commonlook.com/accessibility-software/pdf-validator"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CommonLook PDF

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF Accessibility Checker
(PAC)</a> – a free alternative provided by “Access for all”</li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full
Check…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Full Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking
option</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Start Checking</strong> button</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a
href="#chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml_excel2010-11">Technique 11</a>
(above).</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save As</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> list, select <strong>PDF or XPS
Document</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Options</strong> button</li>
<li>Under <strong>Include non-printing information</strong> in the
<strong>Options</strong> dialog, ensure that the <strong>Document
structure tags for accessibility</strong> check box is selected</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Save</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Tech-12.jpg" width="293" height="331"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Document structure tags for accessibility check box in Options dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save As</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> box, select <strong>Web
Page</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong></li>
<li>Check the HTML file for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml_excel2010-11">Technique 11</a>,
above)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;
tags</li>
<li>Check for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-012-microsoft-excel.xhtml_excel2010-11">Technique 11</a>,
above)<br />
<em>Note:</em> you may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help
with this process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (December 2019), as long as images and
graphical objects are avoided, Excel for Mac provides a set of
accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the production of
accessible digital office documents. However, Excel 2008 for Mac does
not include an accessibility checking feature.</p>

<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using Excel for Mac to
create documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Excel for Mac is <strong>Office Open XML
(XLSX)</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, Excel for Mac offers many other spreadsheet processor
and web format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for
accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are available
for the following formats in <a
href="#chapter-013-microsoft-excel-2008-for-mac.xhtml_12">Technique
12</a> (below):</p>
<ul>
<li>XLS (MS Excel 97 – 2004)</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<p><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Microsoft Excel 2008 for Mac (ver. 12.0 (071130), Mac OS
X, Jan. 2011) and Microsoft Excel (version 16.16.16) while creating a
XLSX document. Files are also easily saved as other file formats (see <a
href="#chapter-013-microsoft-excel-2008-for-mac.xhtml_12">Technique
12</a>, below).</p>
<p>This document is provided for information purposes only and is
neither a recommendation nor a guarantee of results. If errors are
found, please report them to: <a
href="mailto:adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca">adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca</a>.</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-013-microsoft-excel-2008-for-mac.xhtml_excel2008-1"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-013-microsoft-excel-2008-for-mac.xhtml_excel2008-11">Accessibility
Checking</a>, below).</p>
<p>Excel for Mac’s default template for new documents is a blank page.
The basic installation also includes other blank office-related
documents. These are all accessible by virtue of being blank.</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible templates from scratch
in Excel for Mac. As well, you can edit and modify the existing
prepackaged templates, ensuring their accessibility as you do so and
saving them as a new template.</p>

<li>Create a new document</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (see <a
href="#chapter-013-microsoft-excel-2008-for-mac.xhtml_10">Technique
10</a>, below)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save As</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive file name (e.g., “Accessible Inventory Template”)
will increase the prominence of the accessibility status.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Format</strong> list, select <strong>Excel 97–2004
Template (.xlt)</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong><br />

</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible
template available (e.g., that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply
open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Project Gallery…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Category</strong> section, select <strong>My
Templates</strong> (or select where you saved your accessible
template)</li>
<li>Select your accessible template from the template gallery</li>
<li>Select <strong>Open</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Excel2008forMac_2.png" width="580" height="380"
alt="Image demonstrates location of My Templates option in Category section and an accessible template in the tempkate gallery of the Project Gallery dialog." /></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have
chosen an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text, images, etc.),
ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve
accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Set Document Language</h2>
<p>At this time, it is not possible to indicate the natural language of
selected cells within an Excel for Mac workbook. As well, it is not
possible to change the default language of an Excel for Mac
workbook.</p>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h2>Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>At this time, Excel 2008 for Mac does not offer the functionality of
adding alternative text to images or graphical objects.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> For later versions of Excel for Mac,
users can add alt text. For more information, see <a
href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-alternative-text-to-a-shape-picture-chart-smartart-graphic-or-other-object-44989b2a-903c-4d9a-b742-6a75b451c669"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to add alt text for images
and graphical objects</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to of each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
</section>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Select the object, then choose one of the options below:
<ul>
<li>Right-click the object and select <strong>Edit Alt Text…</strong>.
The <strong>Alt Text</strong> pane opens.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/ms-alt-text-menu.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2140" width="200" height="282"
alt="Image demonstrates the right-click context menu with &quot;Edit Alt Text...&quot; selected." />
<ul>
<li><em>Note:</em> If the <strong>Edit Alt Text…</strong> option is not
visible, select <strong>Format Object/Picture</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alternately, select an object. In the menu, select the object’s
<strong>Format</strong> tab. Then, select <strong>Alt
Text</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the <strong>Alt Text</strong> pane, add the alternative text to
the <strong>Description</strong> field.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Format-Picure.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2141" width="300" height="418"
alt="Image demonstrates the Alt Text section of the Format Picture pane." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 4. Format Your Cells</h2>
<p>As you begin adding content, your spreadsheet will require
structuring to bring meaning to the data, make it easier to navigate,
and help assistive technologies read it accurately. One of the easiest
ways to do this is to ensure that you properly format the cells.</p>
<h3>4.1 Named Styles</h3>
<p>At this time, Excel for Mac does not offer a Named Styles
feature.</p>
<p>You should make use of the named styles that are included with the
office application (e.g., “Heading”, “Result”, etc.) before creating
your own styles or using the character formatting tools directly. Named
styles help your readers understand why something was formatted in a
given way, which is especially helpful when there are multiple reasons
for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use italics for emphasis,
Latin terms and species names).</p>
<p>For more information on formatting using named styles, see <a
href="#chapter-013-microsoft-excel-2008-for-mac.xhtml_excel2008-9">Technique
9</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in
much the same way, the named styles often differ.</p>
<p>Formatting header and result cells brings order to the spreadsheet
and makes it easier for users to navigate effectively. For example, you
can format header rows and columns using “Heading” styles to apply
bolded, enlarged, and italicized text (among other characteristics). You
may also want to format cells containing results of calculations to
appear bold and underlined to help distinguish them from the rest of
your data.</p>
<h3>4.2 Other Cell Characteristics</h3>
<p>Ensure your cells are formatted to properly represent your data,
including number and text attributes.</p>
<h4>To format cell characteristics</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells that you want to format</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Cells…</strong></li>
<li>In the relevant sections (e.g., <strong>Numbers</strong>,
<strong>Alignment</strong>, etc.) make your adjustments<br />
<em>Note:</em> When formatting your spreadsheet, it is best to avoid
merging cells. At times, it may seem easier to present your data by
merging cells, but this can make it more difficult for users of
assistive technologies and people navigating your spreadsheet using the
keyboard.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Cell Addressing</h2>
<h3>5.1 Define Names</h3>
<p>Naming the different data ranges within your spreadsheet makes it
easier to navigate through the document and find specific information.
By associating a meaningful name to a data range, you will be enhancing
the readability of your document. These named ranges can be referenced
in multiple locations of your document and within calculations and
equations.</p>
<h4>To define a name</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells you would like to name</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Name &gt; Define…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Define Name</strong> dialog, enter the name for the
data range in the <strong>Names in workbook</strong> text box</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Excel2008forMac_4.png" width="281" height="185"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Names in Workbook text box, Add button, and OK button in Define Name dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience. All basic
accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your
document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within
your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color alone,
to convey information. As well, some further steps should be taken to
ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give
users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the
information.</p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the data that you want to include in the chart</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Chart…</strong></li>
<li>Select your chart type from the <strong>Charts</strong> section that
opens above the document pane<br />
<em>Note:</em> This applies a predefined Chart Layout, which can be
changed at any time simply by selecting the chart and following
<strong>Steps 2 and 3</strong> above.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Excel2008forMac_5.png" width="533" height="351"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Chart Section above document pane of application window." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the chart</li>
<li>If the <strong>Formatting Palette</strong> is not open, go to menu
item: <strong>View &gt; Toolbox, Formatting Palette</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Chart Options</strong> to open the <strong>Chart
Options</strong> section, if it is not already open</li>
<li>Under <strong>Titles</strong>, select the title from the
<strong>Chart Title</strong> drop-down list or enter a title in the text
box below the drop-down list</li>
<li>Under <strong>Other options</strong>, select the
<strong>Labels</strong> and <strong>Legends</strong> you would like to
include from their respective drop-down lists</li>
<li>Under <strong>Chart Data</strong>, select <strong>Data Table with
Legend Keys</strong> from the <strong>Data Table</strong> drop-down list
to include a data table to help further support the chart<br />
<em>Note:</em> It is a good idea to use as many of the titles and labels
as possible.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Excel2008forMac_6.png" width="273" height="594"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Titles options, Other options, and Data Table option in Chart Options and Chart Data sections of the Formatting Palette." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind</li>
<li>Change the default colors to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-013-microsoft-excel-2008-for-mac.xhtml_excel2008-9">Technique
9</a>, below)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 7. Provide Structure for Tables</h2>
<p>Excel for Mac includes a “Data Table” feature, but this meant for
analyzing data by applying preformatted formulas within the data table.
As such, it is not a structural feature in the same way that tables are
in Word.</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-013-microsoft-excel-2008-for-mac.xhtml_excel2008-8"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 8. Use Other Content Structuring Features</h2>
<p>While cell formatting is the most common method of structuring
documents, other content structuring features should be used where
appropriate:</p>
<h3>8.1 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties…</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Summary</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Title</strong> text box and enter the
<strong>Title<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the
properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the
template name, discussed above.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Excel2008forMac_7.png" width="434" height="503"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Summary tab and Title box." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2 Avoid “Floating” Elements</h3>
<p>Avoid “floating” elements (other than charts) such as floating
images, objects, tables or text boxes.<br />
Similarly, avoid placing drawing objects directly into the document
(e.g., as borders, to create a diagram). Instead, create borders with
page layout tools and insert complete graphical objects.</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-013-microsoft-excel-2008-for-mac.xhtml_excel2008-9"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for cell contents.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.<br />
In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php"

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use Excel for Mac’s “Track Changes”
features to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-013-microsoft-excel-2008-for-mac.xhtml_10"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of white space
and by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Navigational Instructions</h3>
<p>Provide a general description of the spreadsheet contents and
instructions on how to navigate the data effectively. The best way to do
this is to make a cell at the beginning of the data (e.g., A1) with this
information. It will be the first cell accessed by assistive
technologies. If you are using this cell for a label or data, you can
attach a comment note to the cell containing navigational
instructions.</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-013-microsoft-excel-2008-for-mac.xhtml_excel2008-11"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>At this time, Excel 2008 for Mac does not offer a mechanism to check
for potential accessibility errors in your document prior to
publishing.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> Later versions of Excel for Mac
include an accessibility checker. For detailed instructions about how to
use the accessibility checker, see <a

<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document
or template (see <a
href="#chapter-013-microsoft-excel-2008-for-mac.xhtml_excel2008-1">Technique
1</a>), then you may consider saving the file into HTML in order to
perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as described
below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>Another option is to save the document into HTML format and use one
of the web accessibility checkers available online. Such as:</p>

<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Before saving in other formats, you may want to run
the <strong>Compatibility Report</strong> feature by selecting
<strong>Compatibility Report…</strong> from the <strong>Save As</strong>
dialog. This checks the compatibility of your existing document with the
format you have selected save your document as. The results of this
check are revealed in the <strong>Compatibility Report</strong> dialog,
where you have explanations of errors and options to fix them. To run
this check at any time, go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Toolbox,
Compatibility Report</strong>.</p>
<h3>XLS</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save As</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>In the <strong>Format</strong> drop-down list, select <strong>Excel

</ol>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (January 10, 2011), Excel 2007 provides a set
of accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the production of
accessible digital office documents. However, Excel 2007 does not
include an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using Excel 2007 to
create documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong>(i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Excel 2007 is <strong>Office Open XML
(XLSX)</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, Excel 2007 offers many other spreadsheet processor and
web format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for
accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are available
for the following formats in Technique 12 (below):</p>
<ul>
<li>MS Excel (XLS)</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users. The application-specific
steps and screenshots in this document were created using Microsoft
Excel 2007 (ver.12.0.6545.5000, Windows 7, Jan. 2011) while creating a
XLSX document. Files are also easily saved as other file formats (see <a
href="#chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-12">Technique
12</a>, below).</p>
<p>This document is provided for information purposes only and is
neither a recommendation nor a guarantee of results. If errors are
found, please report them to: <a
href="mailto:adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca">adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca</a>.</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-1"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-11">Technique
11</a>, below).</p>
<p>Excel 2007’s default template for new documents is a blank page. The
basic installation also includes other blank office-related documents.
These are all accessible by virtue of being blank.</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible templates from scratch
in Excel 2007. As well, you can edit and modify the existing prepackaged
templates, ensuring their accessibility as you do so and saving them as
a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (see <a
href="#chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-11">Technique
11</a>, below)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; Other
Formats</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> list, select <strong>Excel
Template</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive <strong>File name</strong> (e.g., “Accessible
Inventory Template”) will increase the prominence of the accessibility
status. As well, filling in the text box labeled Tags with the term
“accessibility” will improve its searchability as an accessible
file.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible
template available (e.g. that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply
open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; New</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Templates</strong>, select <strong>My
templates…</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Excel2007_1.png" width="414" height="243"
alt="Image demonstrates location of My templates... option under Templates in the New Workbook dialog." /></li>
<li>In the <strong>New</strong> document dialog, select your accessible
template from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
</strong></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have
chosen an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text, images, etc.),
ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve
accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Set Document Language</h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.<br />
At this time, it is not possible to indicate the natural language of
selected cells within an Excel 2007 workbook. [<strong>Tested: Jan 10,
2011</strong>]</p>
<h4>To change the default language for a workbook</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the operating system, activate the keyboard layout for the
language in which you want to create and edit text</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to of each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the object</li>
<li>Select <strong>Size…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Alt Text</strong> tab</li>
<li>Fill in the <strong>Alternative text</strong> box<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Excel2007_2.png" width="278" height="312"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Alt Text tab, Alternative text box, and Close button in the Size and Properties dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 4. Format Your Cells</h2>
<p>As you begin adding content, your spreadsheet will require
structuring to bring meaning to the data, make it easier to navigate,
and help assistive technologies read it accurately. One of the easiest
ways to do this is to ensure that you properly format the cells.</p>
<h3>4.1 Named Styles</h3>
<p>You should make use of the named styles that are included with the
office application (e.g., “Heading”, “Result”, etc.) before creating
your own styles or using the character formatting tools directly. Named
styles help your readers understand why something was formatted in a
given way, which is especially helpful when there are multiple reasons
for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use italics for emphasis,
Latin terms and species names). For more information on formatting using
named styles, see <a
href="#chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-9">Technique
9</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in
much the same way, the named styles often differ.</p>
<p>Formatting header and result cells brings order to the spreadsheet
and makes it easier for users to navigate effectively. For example, you
can format header rows and columns using “Heading” styles to apply
bolded, enlarged, and italicized text (among other characteristics). You
may also want to format cells containing results of calculations to
appear bold and underlined to help distinguish them from the rest of
your data.</p>
<h4>To format a cell with default named styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells that you want to format<br />
<em>Note:</em> to apply a style to an entire row or column, select the
row or column indicator and follow the next steps</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, select the <strong>Cell
Styles</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select the desired formatting style from the drop-down menu<br />
<em>Note:</em> To modify a style, right-click* the desired formatting
style from the drop-down menu and select <strong>Modify</strong>.
Changes made to the style will affect all instances of the style within
your workbook.</li>
</ol>
<h3>4.2 Other Cell Characteristics</h3>
<p>Ensure your cells are formatted to properly represent your data,
including number and text attributes.</p>
<h4>To format cell characteristics</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells that you want to format</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the relevant sections (e.g. <strong>Numbers</strong>,
<strong>Font</strong>, etc.) make your adjustments<br />
<em>Note:</em> When formatting your spreadsheet, it is best to avoid
merging cells. At times, it may seem easier to present your data by
merging cells, but this can make it more difficult for users of
assistive technologies and people navigating your spreadsheet using the
keyboard.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Cell Addressing</h2>
<h3>5.1 Define Names</h3>
<p>Naming the different data ranges within your spreadsheet makes it
easier to navigate through the document and find specific information.
By associating a meaningful name to a data range, you will be enhancing
the readability of your document. These named ranges can be referenced
in multiple locations of your document and within calculations and
equations.</p>
<h4>To define a name</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells you would like to name</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Formulas</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Defined Names</strong> section, select the
<strong>Define Name</strong> button</li>
<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> text box, enter the name for the data
range</li>
<li>In the <strong>Scope</strong> drop-down list, select scope within
which the name can be referenced</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSExcel2010_7.png"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Name box and Scope option in New Name dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Spreadsheet applications support various types of charts, which can
be used to display your spreadsheet data in meaningful ways for your
audience. It is important to ensure that your chart is as accessible as
possible to all members of your audience. All basic accessibility
considerations that are applied to the rest of your document must also
be applied to your charts and the elements within your charts. For
example, use shape and color, rather than color alone, to convey
information. As well, some further steps should be taken to ensure that
the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give users
reference points that will help to correctly interpret the
information.</p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the data that you want to include in the chart</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Charts</strong> section, select the icon of the type
of chart you would like to insert</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Chart Type</strong> from the <strong>Chart
Gallery</strong> in the drop-down menu</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu item:
<strong>Layout</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Labels</strong> section, select the type of title or
label you would like to define (e.g., <strong>Chart Title, Axis Titles,
Data Labels</strong>)<br />
<em>Note:</em> It is a good idea to use as many of the titles and labels
available in this section as possible.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a predefined chart layout</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu item:
<strong>Design</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Layouts</strong> section, select a
<strong>Quick Layout</strong> from the scrolling <strong>Chart
Layouts</strong> gallery</li>
</ol>
<h4>To change to a different predefined chart type</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu item:
<strong>Design</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Type</strong> section, select the <strong>Change
Chart Type</strong> icon</li>
<li>In the <strong>Change Chart Type</strong> dialog, select a chart
type from the left pane</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Chart Design</strong> from the right pane</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind</li>
<li>Change the default colors to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-8">Other
Considerations</a>, below)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 7. Provide Structure for Tables</h2>
<p>Excel 2007 includes an “Insert Table” feature but this works by
applying cell formatting to spreadsheet cells. As such, it is not a
structural feature in the same way that tables are in Word 2010 and
PowerPoint 2010.</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-8"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 8. Use Other Content Structuring Features</h2>
<p>While cell formatting is the most common method of structuring
documents, other content structuring features should be used where
appropriate:</p>
<h3>8.1 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Prepare &gt;
Properties</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Document Properties</strong> section that appears,
select the <strong>Title</strong> text box</li>
<li>Enter the <strong>Title<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the
properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the
template name, discussed above.</li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2 Avoid “Floating” Elements</h3>
<p>Avoid “floating” elements such as floating images, objects, tables or
text boxes.<br />
Similarly, avoid placing drawing objects directly into the document
(e.g., as borders, to create a diagram). Instead, create borders with
page layout tools and insert complete graphical objects.</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-9"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for cell contents.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h4>To change the text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> section, select the <strong>Cell
Styles</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select the style to modify from the list</li>
<li>Right-click* and select: <strong>Modify…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Style</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Format</strong> button<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSExcel2010_8.png"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Format button in Style dialog." /></li>
<li>In the <strong>Format Cells</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Font</strong> tab</li>
<li>In the <strong>Size</strong> text box, type the desired size or
select it from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSExcel2010_9.png"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Font tab and Size option in Format Cells dialog." /></strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.<br />
In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php"

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use Google docs: Spreadsheet’s
review functionality features to track changes, such as revision
history.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Navigational Instructions</h3>
<p>Provide a general description of the spreadsheet contents and
instructions on how to navigate the data effectively. The best way to do
this is to make a cell at the beginning of the data (e.g., A1) with this
information. It will be the first cell accessed by assistive
technologies. If you are using this cell for a label or data, you can
attach a comment note to the cell containing navigational
instructions.</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-11"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>At this time, Excel 2007 does not offer a mechanism to check for
potential accessibility errors in your document prior to publishing.
<strong>[Tested: January 10th, 2011]</strong></p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document
or template (see <a
href="#chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-1">Technique
1</a>), then you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order
to perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as described
below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>Another option is to save the document into HTML format and use one
of the web accessibility checkers available online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation

<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a
href="#chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-11">Technique
11</a> (above).</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; PDF or
XPS</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Options</strong> button</li>
<li>Under <strong>Include non-printing information</strong> in the
<strong>Options</strong> dialog, ensure that the <strong>Document
structure tags for accessibility</strong> check box is selected</li>
<li>Under <strong>PDF options</strong>, ensure that <strong>Bitmap text
when fonts may not be embedded</strong> check box is de-selected</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Save</strong><br />

</ol>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; Other
Formats</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> box, select <strong>Web
Page</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong></li>
<li>Check the HTML file for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-11">Technique
11</a>, above)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;
tags</li>
<li>Check for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-014-microsoft-excel-2007.xhtml_excel2007-11">Technique
11</a>, above)<br />

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (September 30, 2010), Numbers ‘09 lacks
several features that enable accessible office document authoring, most
notably: the ability to add alternative text to images and objects, the
ability to indicate nature language, and programmatically determined
named styles, cell naming, image and object anchoring, or change
tracking features. As a result, some of the other features that might
otherwise support accessibility, such as its extensive templates are not
as effective. In addition, Numbers ‘09 does not include an accessibility
checking feature, which is a more advanced accessibility feature.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> In later versions of Numbers, Apple
added some updates to improve accessibility, including the ability to
add alt text to images and graphical objects. To learn more about
accessibility tips in Numbers, see <a
href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT210563" target="_blank"

Numbers</a>.</p>

<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using Numbers to create
documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Numbers is the native <strong>iWork
format</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, Numbers ‘09 offers many other spreadsheet processor and
web format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for
accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are available
for the following formats in <a
href="#chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num13">Technique 13</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MS Excel</li>
<li>TSV</li>
<li>CSV</li>
<li>PDF</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users.<br />
The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using iWork Numbers ‘09 (ver.2.0.3 (332), Mac OS X, Sept. 2010)
and Numbers 6.1 (December 2019) while producing a document in the
proprietary file format. Files are also easily saved as other file
formats (see <a
href="#chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num13">Technique 13</a>).</p>
<p><span id="chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num1"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num12">Technique 12</a>).</p>
<p>The default template for new documents in Numbers is a blank
spreadsheet, which is accessible by virtue of being blank.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New</strong> or <strong>File &gt;
New from Template Chooser…</strong> (Shift+Apple+N)</li>
<li>In the <strong>Template Chooser</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Blank template</strong> or select one of the other existing
template designs</li>
<li>A new document in your selected template style will open</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (see <a
href="#chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml__Toc282436953">Technique
12</a>)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save as Template…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Export As</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive template name (e.g. “Accessible Memo Template”) will
increase the prominence of the accessibility status.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Where</strong> drop-down list, specify a folder in
which to save your template.<br />
Note: By default, your template will be saved in the home folder in
<strong>Library/Application Support/iWork/Numbers/Templates/My</strong>
<strong>Templates</strong> pane of the <strong>Template
Chooser</strong>. To save the template in a different location than the
default, create a new folder in the <strong>Templates</strong> folder.
The folder name is then used as a template category in the
<strong>Template Chooser</strong>.<img
src="OEBPS/assets/Numbers09_1.png" width="340" height="267"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Export As box and save location drop-down menu." /></li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible
template available (e.g. that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply
open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New from Template
Chooser…</strong> (Shift+Apple+N)</li>
<li>In the <strong>Template Chooser</strong> dialog, select <strong>My
Templates</strong> from the left pane<img
src="OEBPS/assets/Numbers09_2.png" width="274" height="271"
alt="Image demonstrates location of My Templates option and template icons in Template Chooser dialog." /></li>
<li>Select your accessible template and click
<strong>Choose</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Set Document Language</h2>
<p>At this time, it is not possible to manually indicate the natural
language for specific cells or blocks of cells in Numbers ‘09. As well,
it is not possible to change the natural language of the document itself
from the default language. <strong>[Tested: September 29th,
2010]</strong></p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> In later versions of Numbers, users
can set the document language for a spreadsheet within a workbook. For
detailed instructions, see <a
href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/numbers/tan3013d2eb5/mac"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to format a spreadsheet
for another language</a> in Numbers on Mac.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num3"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>At this time, Numbers ’09 does not offer a mechanism which enables
the user to add alternative text descriptions to images or objects.
<strong>[Tested: September 28, 2010]</strong></p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note: </strong>In later versions of Numbers, users
can add alt text for images and graphical objects. To add alt text
descriptions, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the object to select it, click the Format button in the
toolbar, then click image in the inspector.</li>
<li>Click in the Description text box, then enter your description.</li>
</ul>
<p>For detailed instructions, see <a
href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/numbers/tan006229d77/mac"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to add an image
description</a> on the Numbers User Guide for Mac.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<h2>Technique 4. Format Your Cells</h2>
<p>As you begin adding content, your spreadsheet will require
structuring to bring meaning to the data, make it easier to navigate,
and help assistive technologies read it accurately. One of the easiest
ways to do this is to ensure that you properly format the cells.</p>
<h3>4.1 Named Styles</h3>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Numbers does not offer named styles
that can be applied to format and distinguish specific cells from the
rest of your data.</p>
<p>You should make use of the named styles that are included with the
office application (e.g., “Heading”, “Result”, etc.) before creating
your own styles or using the character formatting tools directly. Named
styles help your readers understand why something was formatted in a
given way, which is especially helpful when there are multiple reasons
for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use italics for emphasis,
Latin terms and species names).</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in
much the same way, the named styles often differ.</p>
<p>Formatting header and result cells brings order to the spreadsheet
and makes it easier for users to navigate effectively. For example, you
can format header rows and columns using “Heading” styles to apply
bolded, enlarged, and italicized text (among other characteristics). You
may also want to format cells containing results of calculations to
appear bold and underlined to help distinguish them from the rest of
your data.</p>
<h3>4.2 Table Styles</h3>
<p>Table styles are useful for applying consistent formatting to tables.
In Numbers, each template has one or more table style that formats
various characteristics of your tables. A table style predefines the
table background, the characteristics of cell borders, header rows and
columns, footer rows, and the background and text attributes of cells.
Table styles are useful for distinguishing different types of
information in your spreadsheet.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While the visual characteristics may not necessarily
be helpful for accessibility, identifying the header rows and columns
and pre-formatting text characteristics for these columns is
helpful.</p>
<h4>To apply a table style</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the left pane, go to the <strong>Styles</strong> section</li>
<li>Select the style of table from the list<br />
Note: You can modify any attribute of the table style and your
modifications will remain even if you decide to change to a different
table style.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Numbers09_3.png" width="210" height="302"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Styles section in the left pane." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>4.3 Other Cell Characteristics</h3>
<p>Ensure your cells are formatted to properly represent your data,
including number and text attributes.</p>
<h4>To format cell characteristics</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells that you want to format<br />
Note: to format a row or column, select the row or column indicator and
follow the next steps</li>
<li>In the <strong>Toolbar</strong>, select
<strong>Inspector</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, select <strong>Cells
inspector</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Cell Format</strong> drop-down list and choose
the format</li>
<li>Customize the format options<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Numbers09_4.png" width="221" height="181"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Cell Format section in Inspector dialog." /><br />
<em>Note:</em> When formatting your spreadsheet, it is best to avoid
merging cells. At times, it may seem easier to present your data by
merging cells, but this can make it more difficult for users of
assistive technologies and people navigating your spreadsheet using the
keyboard.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Cell Addressing</h2>
<h3>5.1 Define Names</h3>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Numbers does not provide a mechanism
for applying names to specific data ranges. Rather, it advises authors
that they can use existing header row and column names to address cells
within a table. While this may be useful when defining formulas, it does
not provide the necessary support for accessibility.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> To see header names more clearly, be
sure to make the following change under preferences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Numbers</strong> &gt;
<strong>Preferences</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Cell References</strong>, ensure that the check box is
checked off for the option “Use header names as labels.”<br />
<strong><img
src="OEBPS/assets/Screen-Shot-2019-12-16-at-12.41.08-PM-298x300.png"
class="alignnone wp-image-2135 size-medium" width="298" height="300"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Cell References item in the Preferences menu in Numbers." /></strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<p>Naming the different data ranges within your spreadsheet makes it
easier to navigate through the document and find specific information.
By associating a meaningful name to a data range, you will be enhancing
the readability of your document. These named ranges can be referenced
in multiple locations of your document and within calculations and
equations.</p>
<h2>Technique 6. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Spreadsheet applications support various types of charts, which can
be used to display your spreadsheet data in meaningful ways for your
audience. It is important to ensure that your chart is as accessible as
possible to all members of your audience. All basic accessibility
considerations that are applied to the rest of your document must also
be applied to your charts and the elements within your charts. For
example, use shape and color, rather than color alone, to convey
information. As well, some further steps should be taken to ensure that
the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give users
reference points that will help to correctly interpret the
information.</p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Toolbar</strong>, select <strong>Charts</strong> or
go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Chart</strong></li>
<li>Select the chart type</li>
<li>In the <strong>Toolbar</strong>, select
<strong>Inspector</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Chart
inspector</strong></li>
<li>Format the chart type and chart colors by selecting <strong>Choose a
chart type</strong> and <strong>Chart Colors…</strong> options</li>
<li>Select <strong>Chart</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart</strong> section, select the <strong>Show
Title</strong> and <strong>Show Legend</strong> check boxes</li>
<li>Select <strong>Axis</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Axis</strong> section, select <strong>Choose Axis
Options</strong> for both <strong>Value Axis (Y)</strong> and
<strong>Category Axis (X)</strong><br />
Note: It is a good idea to “show” as many title and labeling elements as
possible (e.g. <strong>Show Axis</strong>, <strong>Show Title</strong>,
<strong>Show Categories</strong>, <strong>Show Series Names</strong>,
etc.)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind</li>
<li>Change the default colors to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num10">Technique 10</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 7. Provide Structure for Tables</h2>
<h4>To add a table with headers</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Table</strong></li>
<li>Select table style</li>
<li>In the <strong>Toolbar</strong>, select
<strong>Inspector</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, select the <strong>Table
inspector</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> box, enter a name for the table</li>
<li>In the <strong>Headers &amp; Footer</strong> section, select the
number of header rows and columns using the drop-down menus (Note: It is
recommended to keep your tables simple by using only one header row and
column).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Use Other Content Structuring Features</h2>
<p>While cell formatting is the most common method of structuring
documents, other content structuring features should be used where
appropriate:</p>
<h3>8.1 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Toolbar</strong>, select
<strong>Inspector</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Document inspector</strong> button</li>
<li>In the <strong>Spotlight</strong> section, type a descriptive name
for the document in the <strong>Title</strong> box<strong><br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the
properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the
template name, discussed above.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Numbers09_5.png" width="165" height="309"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Title box in Document section of Inspector dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2 Avoid “Floating” Elements</h3>
<p>Avoid “floating” elements (other than charts) such as floating
images, objects, tables or text boxes.</p>
<p>Similarly, avoid placing drawing objects directly into the document
(e.g., as borders, to create a diagram). Instead, create borders with
page layout tools and insert complete graphical objects.</p>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to be
printed, try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for cell contents.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.<br />
In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use the applications revision
tracking feature to track changes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Numbers does not offer a mechanism to
track changes in its documents.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the steps noted in <a
href="#chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num3">Technique 3</a>.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num10"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Navigational Instructions</h3>
<p>Provide a general description of the spreadsheet contents and
instructions on how to navigate the data effectively. The best way to do
this is to make a cell at the beginning of the data (e.g., A1) with this
information. It will be the first cell accessed by assistive
technologies. If you are using this cell for a label or data, you can
attach a comment note to the cell containing navigational
instructions.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num11"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Numbers does not offer an accessibility
checking mechanism to identify potential accessibility errors prior to
publishing.</p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document
or template (see <a
href="#chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num1">Technique 1</a>), then
you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order to perform an
accessibility check in one of those formats, as described below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of your document or template
(see <a href="#chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num11">Technique
1</a>), one option is to save it into HTML format and use one of the web
accessibility checkers available online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Acrobat Professional</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://commonlook.com/accessibility-software/pdf-validator"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CommonLook PDF
Evaluator</a></li>
<li><a

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF Accessibility Checker
(PAC)</a> – a free alternative provided by “Access for all”</li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full
Check…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Full Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking
option</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Start Checking</strong> button</li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> For detailed instructions, see our
section on <a href="#chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml"

using Adobe Acrobat Professional</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span id="chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num12"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h3>Alternate formats</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Share &gt; Export…</strong></li>
<li>In the dialog, select the type of file format you would like to
export</li>
<li>Customize the export options for that file format</li>
<li>Click <strong>Next</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save As</strong> box, enter a file name for your
document</li>
<li>In the <strong>Where</strong> drop-down menu, select the location
you would like to save your document</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a
href="#chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num1">Technique 1</a>.</p>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;
tags</li>
<li>Check for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num12">Technique 11</a>)<br />
<em>Note:</em> you may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help
with this process.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="chapter-015-numbers-for-mac.xhtml_num13"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 13. Consider Using Accessibility Support
Applications/Plugins</h2>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (December 2019), Calc provides a set of
accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the production of
accessible digital office documents. However, Calc does not include an
accessibility checking feature, which is a more advanced accessibility
feature.</p>
<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using Calc to create
documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Calc is <strong>ODF Spreadsheet
(ODS)</strong>. In addition, Calc offers many other spreadsheet
processor and web format saving options. Most of these have not been
checked for accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are
available for the following formats in <a
href="#chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc12">Technique 12</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MS Excel</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users. The application-specific
steps and screenshots in this document were created using Calc (ver.
3.2.1, Windows XP, Aug. 2010 and Apache OpenOffice 4.1.7) while creating
an ODT document. Files are also easily saved as other file formats (see
<a href="#chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc12">Technique
12</a>).</p>
<p><span id="chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc1"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting. Because templates provide the
starting-point for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you
are unsure whether a template is accessible, you should check a sample
document produced when the template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc11">Technique 11</a>).
Calc’s default template for new documents is a blank spreadsheet, which
is accessible by virtue of being blank. It is possible to create your
own accessible templates from scratch in Calc. As well, you can edit and
modify the existing prepackaged templates, ensuring their accessibility
as you do so and saving them as a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (see <a
href="#chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc11">Technique 11</a>)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> to
indicate the accessibility status of the template. Using
<strong>Title</strong> (e.g., “Accessible Memo Template”) will increase
the prominence of the accessibility status because this is used in place
of the template’s file name. <strong>Comments</strong> can be used to
add more information if necessary (e.g., “This memo template has been
checked for accessibility.”).</li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong><strong>OK<br />
</strong></strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOCalc1.png" width="529"
height="390"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Title box and Comments box in Properties dialog." /></li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Templates &gt; Save</strong>
(Shift+F11)</li>
<li>In the <strong>New Template</strong> box, type a name for the
template. Again, using a descriptive template name (e.g. “Accessible
Memo Template”) will increase the prominence of the accessibility status
of the template.</li>
<li>Select the category you would like to save it in, under
<strong>Categories</strong> <em>Note:</em> the category is simply the
folder into which you are saving the template</li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong>OK<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOCalc2.png" width="552" height="233"
alt="Image demonstrates location of New Template box and Categories options in Templates dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible
template available (e.g. that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply
open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Templates and
Documents</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Templates</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select a template from the list <em>Note:</em> A properties pane
appears on the right side of the window, where you can read the document
properties (Title, By, Date, Modified by, Modified on, Description,
Size). If you placed information about the accessibility of the template
in the <strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> when you
created the template (see above), this will be displayed in the
<strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Description</strong>,
respectively.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Open<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOCalc3.png" width="630" height="433"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Templates icon, Title, and Description in My Templates dialog." /></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have
chosen an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text, images, etc.),
ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve
accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Set Document Language</h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h4>To select a language for the whole document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools &gt; Options</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Language Settings &gt; Languages</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Default languages</strong> for documents, select the
document language for all newly created documents <em>Note:</em> If you
mark <strong>For the current document only</strong>, your choice will
only apply to the current document.</li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong>OK</strong><img
src="OEBPS/assets/OOCalc4.png" width="735" height="384"
alt="Image demonstrates location of language option in Languages dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To format the language for a block of cells</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select the cells to which you want to apply a language</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Cells…</strong> (Ctrl+1)</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Language</strong> and click
<strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected text</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select the text to which you want to apply a language</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Character</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Language</strong> and click <strong>OK<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOCalc5.png" width="529" height="390"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Language option in Character dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 3. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Right-click on object</li>
<li>Select <strong>Description…</strong> option</li>
<li>Enter alternative text in the <strong>Title</strong> box</li>
<li><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOCalc6.png" width="357" height="196"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Title box in Description dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add long descriptions to images and graphical objects</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Right-click on object</li>
<li>Select <strong>Description…</strong> option</li>
<li>Enter description in <strong>Description</strong> box</li>
<li><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOCalc7.png" width="357" height="196"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Description box in Description dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 4. Format Your Cells</h2>
<p>As you begin adding content, your spreadsheet will require
structuring to bring meaning to the data, make it easier to navigate,
and help assistive technologies read it accurately. One of the easiest
ways to do this is to ensure that you properly format the cells.</p>
<h3>4.1 Named Styles</h3>
<p>You should make use of the named styles that are included with the
office application (e.g., “Heading”, “Result”, etc.) before creating
your own styles or using the character formatting tools directly. Named
styles help your readers understand why something was formatted in a
given way, which is especially helpful when there are multiple reasons
for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use italics for emphasis,
Latin terms and species names). For more information on formatting using
named styles, see <a
href="#chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc9">Technique 9</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in
much the same way, the named styles often differ. Formatting header and
result cells brings order to the spreadsheet and makes it easier for
users to navigate effectively. For example, you can format header rows
and columns using “Heading” styles to apply bolded, enlarged, and
italicized text (among other characteristics). You may also want to
format cells containing results of calculations to appear bold and
underlined to help distinguish them from the rest of your data.</p>
<h4>To format a cell with default named styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells that you want to format <em>Note:</em> to apply
a style to an entire row or column, select the row or column indicator
and follow the next steps</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting</strong>
(F11)</li>
<li>Double click on the desired formatting style <em>Note:</em> If a
style is modified in the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> panel,
the modification will apply to every application of that style<img
src="OEBPS/assets/OOCalc8.png" width="497" height="272"
alt="Image demonstrates location of formatting styles options in Styles and Formatting dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>4.2 Other Cell Characteristics</h3>
<p>Ensure your cells are formatted to properly represent your data,
including number and text attributes.</p>
<h4>To format cell characteristics</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the cells that you want to format<em>Note:</em> to format
a row or column, select the row or column indicator and follow the next
steps</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Cell…</strong> (Ctrl+1)</li>
<li>Select the relevant tabs (e.g. <strong>Numbers</strong>,
<strong>Font</strong>, etc.) and make your adjustments</li>
<li>Click <strong><strong>OK<br />
</strong></strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOCalc9.png" width="529"
height="390"
alt="Image demonstrates location of formatting tabs in Format Cells dialog." /><br />
<em>Note:</em> When formatting your spreadsheet, it is best to avoid
merging cells. At times, it may seem easier to present your data by
merging cells, but this can make it more difficult for users of
assistive technologies and people navigating your spreadsheet using the
keyboard.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Cell Addressing</h2>
<h3>5.1 Define Label Range</h3>
<p>Label ranges help to logically define the contents of specific cells
as either labels or data. This is useful for navigational purposes,
allowing users to jump between ranges of data and navigate within each
range. This is also useful for calculations, as you may reference an
entire label range within an equation.</p>
<h4>To define a label range</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the header cells</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Names &gt;
Labels…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Minimize</strong> button beside the <strong>For
data range</strong> box</li>
<li>Highlight the data cells within the label range</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Maximize</strong> button to view the dialog</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOCalc10.png" width="613" height="432"
alt="Image demonstrates location of data range box and Maximize button in Define Label Range dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>5.2 Define Names</h3>
<p>Naming the different data ranges within your spreadsheet makes it
easier to navigate through the document and find specific information.
By associating a meaningful name to a data range, you will be enhancing
the readability of your document. These named ranges can be referenced
in multiple locations of your document and within calculations and
equations.</p>
<h4>To define a name</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Names &gt; Define…</strong>
(Ctrl+F3)</li>
<li>Enter the name in the <strong>Name</strong> text box</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Minimize</strong> button next to the
<strong>Assigned to</strong> text box</li>
<li>Highlight the cells you would like to assign the name to</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Maximize</strong> button next to the text box to
view the dialog</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOCalc11.png" width="512" height="360"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Age box, Assigned to box, and Maximize button in Define Names dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience. All basic
accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your
document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within
your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color alone,
to convey information. As well, some further steps should be taken to
ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give
users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the
information.</p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Chart…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Wizard</strong> dialog, follow steps 1 to 4 to
format your chart <em>Note:</em> When you are selecting your formatting
options in each step, ensure that your selections align with the
accessibility techniques in this document.</li>
<li>In <strong>Step 4</strong>, make sure to define all chart elements
(e.g. title, subtitle, legend, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To name a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the chart</li>
<li>Select <strong>Name…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Name</strong> dialog, enter a unique chart name in
the <strong>Name</strong> text box</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To provide alternative text for the chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the chart</li>
<li>Select <strong>Description…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Description</strong> dialog, enter alternative text
in the <strong>Title</strong> box</li>
<li>Enter a longer description of the chart contents in the
<strong>Description</strong> box</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind</li>
<li>Change the default colors to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc9">Technique 9</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 7. Provide Structure for Tables</h2>
<p>Calc has an “Insert table” feature.</p>
<h4>To insert a new table</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the cursor where you would like the table to appear.</li>
<li>To insert a table, you have two options:
<ul>
<li>From the main menu, select <strong>Table</strong>
&gt; <strong>Insert</strong> &gt;  <strong>Table</strong> (<em>keyboard
shortcut: </em>Ctrl+F12).</li>
<li>Alternately, from the toolbar, click on the <strong>Table</strong>
icon (<img src="OEBPS/assets/oo-table-icon.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2127" width="39" height="20"
alt="Grid-like Table icon" />)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the <strong>Insert Table </strong>dialog box, specify the
properties for the new table.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/oo-insert-table-menu.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2128" width="500" height="274"
alt="Insert table dialog box" /></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<h2>Technique 8. Use Other Content Structuring Features</h2>
<p>While cell formatting is the most common method of structuring
documents, other content structuring features should be used where
appropriate:</p>
<h3>8.1 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Description</strong> tab</li>
<li>Type the new title in the <strong>Title</strong> box and click
<strong>OK<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> The title defined in the properties is different
than the file name. It is also unrelated to the template name, discussed
above.</li>
</ol>
<h3>8.2 Avoid “Floating” Elements</h3>
<p>Avoid “floating” elements (other than charts) such as floating
images, objects, tables or text boxes. Similarly, avoid placing drawing
objects directly into the document (e.g., as borders, to create a
diagram). Instead, create borders with page layout tools and insert
complete graphical objects.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc9"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for cell contents.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h4>To change the text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting</strong>
(F11)</li>
<li>Select the style to modify from the list</li>
<li>Right click and select: <strong>Modify…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select a font size under <strong>Size</strong></li>
<li>Exit with <strong>OK<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOCalc12.png" width="529" height="390"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Font tab and size options in Cell Style dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern. In order to determine whether the colors in your
document have sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast
checker, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3><span id="chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_tech9-4"></span>9.4
Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use OpenOffice Calc’s review
functionality features to track changes, such as revision history.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Navigational Instructions</h3>
<p>Provide a general description of the spreadsheet contents and
instructions on how to navigate the data effectively. The best way to do
this is to make a cell at the beginning of the data (e.g., A1) with this
information. It will be the first cell accessed by assistive
technologies. If you are using this cell for a label or data, you can
attach a comment note to the cell containing navigational
instructions.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc11"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>At this time, Calc does not offer a mechanism to check for potential
accessibility errors in your document prior to publishing.
<strong>[Tested: September 30th, 2010]</strong></p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document
or template (see <a
href="#chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc1">Technique 1</a>), then
you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order to perform an
accessibility check in one of those formats, as described below.</p>
<h3>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h3>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of your document or template
(see <a href="#chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc1">Technique
1</a>), one option is to save it into HTML format and use one of the web
accessibility checkers available online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Acrobat Professional</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://commonlook.com/accessibility-software/pdf-validator"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CommonLook PDF

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF Accessibility Checker
(PAC)</a> – a free alternative provided by “Access for all”</li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full
Check…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Full Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking
option</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Start Checking</strong> button</li>
</ol>

</div>
<p><span id="chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc12"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a
href="#chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc11">Technique 11</a>.</p>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<ol>
<li>Apply one of the default heading paragraph styles to the paragraphs
where you want to generate an HTML page</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Send &gt; Create HTML
Document</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Styles</strong> box, select the paragraph style that
you want to use to generate a new HTML page</li>
<li>Enter a path and a name for the HTML document</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
<li>Check the HTML file for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc11">Technique 11</a>)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ol>
<li>Remove unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;
tags</li>
<li>Check for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-016-openoffice-calc.xhtml_ocalc11">Technique 11</a>)
<em>Note:</em> you may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help
with this process.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 13. Consider Using Accessibility Support
Applications/Plugins</h2>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (December 2019), <a
href="https://docs.google.com/presentation" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Slides</a> lacks several features that
enable accessible office document authoring, most notably: a separate
document title field and the ability to indicate headings for rows and
columns. With this in mind, be cautious of templates available in the
Google Slides template gallery and be sure that they comply the
techniques discussed here.</p>
<p>While there is no accessibility checking feature built into Google
Slides, you can install a third-party add-on called Grackle Slides.
Grackle is a third-party plug-in that includes an accessibility checker
along with other features that enhance accessibility on <a
href="https://www.grackledocs.com/grackle-slides-accessible-presentations"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Slides</a> (see <a
href="#chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides11">Technique 11</a>). Due
to the nature of Google Slides, some accessibility features, such as
tables, are only fully accessible when exporting the document to another
format, like a HTML or PDF file.</p>
<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using Google Slides to
create documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity),</li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>Google Slides does not have a default file format, as it is a
web-based authoring tool.</p>
<p>Google Slides offers a number of presentation processor and web
format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for
accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are available
for the following formats in <a
href="#chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides12">Technique 12</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft PowerPoint (.pptx)</li>
<li>ODP Document (.odp)</li>
<li>PDF Document (.pdf)</li>
<li>Plain Text (.txt)</li>
<li>JPEG image (.jpg, current slide)</li>
<li>PNG image (.png, current slide)</li>
<li>Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg, current slide)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users. Files are easily saved as
various file formats (see <a
href="#chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides12">Technique 12</a>).</p>

<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Google Slides lacks support for
accessibility features such as table headings.</p>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides11">Technique 11</a>).</p>
<p>Google Slides’s default template for new documents is a blank
presentation. The basic installation also includes a wide variety of
templates for business presentations. These are all accessible by virtue
of being blank.</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own templates from scratch in Google
Slides. As well, you can edit and modify the existing templates,
ensuring their accessibility as you do so and saving them as a new
template.</p>
<h4>To select a template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Sheets</a>.</li>
<li>At the top right, click on <strong>Template Gallery</strong>.<br />

<li>Create a new document (from the default template or from an existing
template).<br />
<em>Note:</em> If creating a template from an existing document, go to
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Make a copy</strong>. Type a name and
choose where to save it, then, click <strong>Ok</strong>.</li>
<li>Rename your document. Be sure to indicate that the document is an
accessible template by using terms such as “accessible” (e.g.,
“Accessible Memo Template”). This will improve its searchability and
promote its use as an accessible template.</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow techniques in this document. You may also
check the accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides11">Technique 11</a>).</li>
</ol>
<h4><em>To share your accessible template as a new document</em></h4>
<p>You can share your accessible template, but it may be more useful to
share the file as copy that other users can add to their Google
Drive.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the address bar change the end of the URL before sending
it.</li>
<li>Replace “edit” at the end of the URL with “copy”.<br />
<em>For example:</em><br />
<strong>Before:</strong>
http://docs.google.com/document/d/12345678/<em><strong>edit</strong></em><br />
<strong>After:</strong>
http://docs.google.com/document/d/12345678/<em><strong>copy</strong></em></li>
<li>Send the modified copy link.</li>
<li>When the recipient follows the modified copy link, they’re
instructed to click on <strong>Make a copy</strong>.</li>
<li>They can then work on a copy of the accessible template.</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<h2>Technique 2. Set Document Language</h2>
<p>At this time, Google Slides does not offer an explicit language
selection mechanism to indicate the natural language of your document or
changes in natural language at any point within the content. Google
Slides defaults the natural language to the language selected for your
Google Account. When exporting to other document formats, there is no
guarantee that the natural language of your Google Account will be
indicated as the natural language of your document.</p>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h2>Technique 3. Use Built-In Layout and Styling Features</h2>
<p>Google Slides does not offer “True Headings” or “Named Styles”.</p>
<h3>3.1 Use Built-In Slide Layouts</h3>
<p>Instead of creating each slide in your presentation by starting from
a blank slide, check whether there is a suitable built-in layout.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The built-in layouts can be more accessible to users
of assistive technologies because they technologies sometimes read the
floating items on the slide in the order that they were placed on the
slide. The built-in layouts have usually taken this into account (e.g.,
“Title” first followed by other items, left to right and from top to
bottom). If you create slide layouts from scratch, it is sometimes
difficult to keep track of the order elements were placed.</p>
<h4>To apply “true layout” to a slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Slide &gt; New Slide…</strong>
(Ctrl+M).</li>
<li>In the <strong>Layout</strong> drop-down on the toolbar, select a
slide layout from the options.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gslides-layout.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1925" width="415" height="462"
alt="Image demonstrates the different layout options in the layout gallery." /></li>
<li>A new slide will be inserted into the presentation with the layout
you selected</li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2 Customize Using Master Slides</h3>
<p>Google Slides is  packaged with master slides available for your use.
If a layout must be customized, it is recommended that Master Slides be
used.</p>
<p>Every slide layout in a presentation is defined by its master slide.
A master slide determines the formatting style for various elements of
the slide layout. This includes font styles, character formatting, and
the positioning of elements. Essentially, each master slide acts as a
design template for the slide layout.</p>
<p>If you edit any aspect of the slide layout in the master slide, the
change will affect all slides that were created based on it. For this
reason, it is good practice to edit the master slide and use the slide
layouts before building individual slides. It is essential that you
create and use master slides that meet the accessibility requirements
outlined in this document.</p>
<p>One way around this is to format a slide, ensuring its accessibility,
and then create duplicates of that slide within your presentation. You
can then edit the content of the duplicate slides, while ensuring that
its layout meets accessibility requirements. In this way, the original
slide acts as design template for the slides derived from it.</p>
<h4>To duplicate a slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Slide &gt; Duplicate slide</strong>.</li>
<li>Edit the content of your duplicate slide, ensuring your changes do
not negatively affect accessibility of the slide.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To change a theme</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to the menu item <strong>Slide</strong>, then select
<strong>Change theme.</strong></li>
<li>On the right sidebar, select the theme you want.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> If you would like to include a unique slide layout for
a single slide, see <a
href="https://support.google.com/docs/forum/AAAABuH1jm0e1gi00se6Bg"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google: Learn how to apply a
theme to only one slide</a>.</p>
<h4>To customize a master slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to the menu item <strong>Slide</strong> &gt; <strong>Edit
master</strong>.<em><br />
Optional: </em> Before editing the master, you can first select a theme
that is similar to the design you want before editing the master
(select <strong>Theme</strong>, then select a theme from the
right).</li>
<li>In the master template editor, select the <strong>Master</strong>
slide at the top.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gslide-master-slide.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1931" width="782" height="446"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Master slide in the Edit master pane." /></li>
<li>Make your edits to the master slide.</li>
<li>When finished, select the “x” at the top-righthand side of the menu
to close.</li>
<li>Your presentation should be updated with the changes.</li>
</ol>

href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/1705254" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google: Change the theme, background, or
layout in Google Slides</a>.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides4"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 4. Set a Logical Tab Order</h2>
<p>Many presentation applications create content composed almost
exclusively of “floating” objects. This means that they avoid the
transitions between in-line content and secondary “floating” objects
(text boxes, images, etc.) that can cause accessibility issues in word
processors.</p>
<p>However, when you are working with “floating” objects, it is
important to remember that the way objects are positioned in two
dimensions on the screen may be completely different from how the
objects will be read by a screen reader or navigated using a keyboard.
The order that content is navigated sequentially is called the “Tab
Order” because often the “Tab” key is used to navigate from one
“floating” object to the next.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for setting a logical “tab order” for “floating” objects</h4>
<ul>
<li>The tab order of floating objects is usually from the “lowest”
object on the slide to the “highest”.</li>
<li>Because objects automatically appear “on top” when they are
inserted, the default tab order is from the first object inserted to the
last. However, this will change if you use features such as “bring to
front” and “send to back”.</li>
<li>The slide’s main heading should be first in the tab order.</li>
<li>Headings should be placed in the tab order immediately before the
items (text, diagrams, etc.) for which they are acting as a
heading.</li>
<li>Labels should be in the reading order placed immediately before the
objects that they label.</li>
<li>For simple slide layouts, it may be possible to simply insert
objects in a logical tab order.</li>
<li>For more complex layouts, it may be easier to simply to create the
slide as usual and then set the tab order (see below).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To set the tab order</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the object.</li>
<li>Go to menu item <strong>Arrange</strong> &gt; <strong>Order</strong>
&gt; <strong>Bring to front</strong>, <strong>Bring forward</strong>,
<strong>Send backward</strong>, or <strong>Send to back</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gslides-arrange-order.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1933" width="419" height="238"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Order sub-menu under the Arrange menu item." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Slide Notes</h2>
<p>A useful aspect of presentation applications is the facility to add
notes to slides, which can then be read by assistive technologies. You
can use these slide notes to explain and expand on the contents of your
slides in text format. Slide notes can be created as you build your
presentation.</p>
<h4>To add notes to your slides</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show Speaker Notes<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> Once you have selected this option, the
<strong>Speaker notes</strong> pane will appear on the right side of the
window for each slide. If you close the <strong>Speaker notes</strong>
pane, you will have to perform the above step to access it again.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Speaker notes</strong> pane on the right, enter notes
to accompany each slide.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>Google Slides offers a mechanism for adding alternative text to
images and objects where it can be readily accessed by screen reader
users. While you can add alt text, you will need to ensure that you
provide the longer descriptions in the body of the document, near the
images and objects. While this solution is not optimal for screen reader
users and will complicate your own accessibility testing, it is
necessary until long descriptions are supported.</p>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text of each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* on the image.</li>
<li>Select Alt Text from the contextual menu.<br />

class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1937" width="313" height="647"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Alt text function in the right-click context menu." /></li>
<li>Add your alt text to the <strong>Description</strong> field.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/google-alt-description.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1838" width="545" height="390"
alt="Image demonstrates the Alt Text pop-up menu with focus on the Description field." /></li>
<li>Press <strong>OK</strong> to save<em>Note:</em><span
style="font-size: 1em">Enter a description in the
</span><strong>Title</strong><span style="font-size: 1em">field will
show a pop-up tooltip when users hover over the image with their mouse. 
However, it is recommended to put the image description in the
</span><strong>Description</strong><span
style="font-size: 1em">field.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Technique 7. Use Built-In Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Google Slides does not offer a
mechanism that allows you to select and indicate headings for rows and
columns. Since it is not possible to create complex tables in Google
Slides that are accessible, avoid creating complex tables since table
headers cannot be designated. </p>
<p>If you use the <a
href="https://www.grackledocs.com/grackle-slides-accessible-presentations"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Slides</a> add-on,
tables can be given structure and table headings can be indicated. While
these fixes won’t be useful for making tables more accessible in Google
Slides, it does allow you to export the document into another format
with appropriate table tags intact. For more on Grackle Slides, see <a
href="#chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides11">Technique 11</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cells labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page (see <a
href="#chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides4">Technique 4</a>).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h3>7.2 Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text box or highlight the text</li>
<li>Go to the menu bar</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Numbered list</strong> or <strong>Bullet
list</strong> button<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gslides-list-button.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1938" width="903" height="303"
alt="Image demonstrates location of list buttons in menu bar." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use Columns feature for placing text in columns.<br />
<em>Note:</em> Because columns can be a challenge for users of some
assistive technologies, consider whether a column layout is really
necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Document Title</h3>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Google Slides makes use of a single
document name. Within Google Slides, this serves well as a title, but
when exporting to ODT, the document name is used to form the file name,
and the ODT “Title” properties field is left blank, or it lists the
title used in the <strong>first slide</strong> of the presentation.</p>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the file name of the current document</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Rename</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Rename Document</strong> dialog, enter a new document
name</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>In Google Slides, you can insert data charts linked to an existing
Google Sheet file (see <a
href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7009814" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Help: Link a chart or table to Google
Slides</a> for instructions).</p>
<p>Charts can be used to display data in meaningful ways for your
audience. It is important to ensure that your chart is as accessible as
possible to all members of your audience. All basic accessibility
considerations that are applied to the rest of your document must also
be applied to your charts and the elements within your charts. For
example, use shape and color, rather than color alone, to convey
information. As well, some further steps should be taken to ensure that
the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give users
reference points that will help to correctly interpret the
information.</p>
<h4>To add a new chart to a presentation</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Insert</strong> &gt; <strong>Chart</strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gslide-insert-chart.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1967" width="381" height="440"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Insert Chart options, located under the Insert menu on the toolbar." /></li>
<li>Select the type of chart you want to add.<br />
<em>Note: </em>To edit a chart, see <a
href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/7009814#edit_original_files"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Help: Edit or Update
Chart Data</a>.<br />
<em>Note:</em> To learn more about how to customize the chart you
created, see <a
href="https://www.brightcarbon.com/blog/google-slides-ultimate-guide/#charts"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BrightCarbon: Google Slides:
The ULTIMATE guide (blog post)</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply textures instead of
colors to differentiate the bars</li>
<li>Change the default colors to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides9-2">Technique
9.2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to be
printed, try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3><span id="chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides9-2"></span>9.2 Use
Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.<br />
In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use Google Slides’s change tracking
features to track changes, such as revision history.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g. “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h3>9.6 Avoid Transitions</h3>
<p>Transitions between slides and elements in each slide (e.g., bullets
in a list flying onto the screen) can be distracting to users with
disabilities. It can also cause assistive technologies to read the slide
incorrectly. For these reasons, it is best to avoid transitions
altogether.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own.</p>
<h4>To add hyperlinks with meaningful text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Link.</strong> Alternately, you
can select the text you’d like to add a link to and press Ctrl+K (or
Cmd+K on Macs).</li>
<li>In the pop-up box, enter descriptive text in the
<strong>Text</strong> display box.</li>
<li>Enter the link address in the <strong>Link</strong>.</li>
<li>Select <strong><strong>Apply</strong></strong>.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gdoc-link.png"

</ol>
<h3>10.3 Accessible Presentations</h3>
<p>It is important to consider accessibility before, during, and after
presentations. Below is a helpful link with guidance on how to make
presentations accessible to all:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How to Make Presentations Accessible to All” <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/accessible" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">(Source: W3C-WAI Draft)</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>Enable live automatic captions when presenting</h4>
<p>In Google Slides, you can present slides with automatic captions that
displays the speaker’s words in real time at the bottom of the
screen.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> This feature is only available on Chrome devices in
U.S. English. Also, captions are not stored.</p>
<h5>Step 1: Set up your microphone</h5>
<ol>
<li>Google Slides requires your computer’s microphone or an external
microphone paired with your computer to be turned on and working.</li>
<li>Devices and microphones vary, so be sure to check your computer’s
settings. Typically, these settings are found under <a
href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH22070" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">System Preferences</a> on a Mac or in the <a
href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/13764" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Control Panel</a> on a PC.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Step 2: Present with captions</h5>
<ol>
<li>Connect to the internet.</li>
<li>Open your presentation.</li>
<li>To start presenting, click <strong>Present</strong>.</li>

<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>At this time (December 2019), Google Slides does not offer a
mechanism to check for potential accessibility errors in your document
prior to publishing. However, a third-party add-on called Grackle Sheets
can be used to check the accessibility of your workbook (see below).</p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document
or template (see <a
href="#chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slide1">Technique 1</a>), then
you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order to perform an
accessibility check in one of those formats, as described below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of your document or template
(see <a href="#chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slide1">Technique 1</a>),
one option is to save it into HTML format and use one of the web
accessibility checkers available online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Acrobat Professional</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://commonlook.com/accessibility-software/pdf-validator"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CommonLook PDF
Evaluator</a></li>
<li><a

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF Accessibility Checker
(PAC)</a> – a free alternative provided by “Access for all”</li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full
Check…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Full Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking
option</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Start Checking</strong> button</li>
</ol>

<h3>Grackle Slides</h3>
<p><em>Warning:</em> Automated accessibility checkers cannot be trusted
to check for all accessibility concerns, so be sure to review the
recommended techniques in this document.</p>
<p><strong>What is Grackle Slides?</strong><a
href="https://www.grackledocs.com/grackle-slides-accessible-presentations"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Slides</a> is a
third-party add-on that runs on spreadsheets created in Google Sheets.
It helps with checking and improving the digital accessibility of your
document. Due to the nature of Google Sheets, some accessibility
features, such as tables, are only fully accessible when exporting the
document to another format, like an HTML file.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong> After Grackle is launched, It
scans the current spreadsheet for accessibility issues and identifies
and locates errors. Feedback appears in a sidebar that is docked on
right-side of the screen. By exploring the sidebar, you can immediately
learn about accessibility issues and find and fix the detected errors by
interacting with the Grackle sidebar. Due to the nature of Google
Slides, some accessibility features, such as tables, are only fully
accessible when exporting the document to another format, like a HTML or
PDF file.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Grackle’s accessibility checker is free to use;
however, the ability to export and produce accessible HTML spreadsheets,
and so on, is only free for the first 30 days (as of December 2019).</p>
<p>At the time of testing, <a
href="https://www.grackledocs.com/features/create-tagged-pdf-slides"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating tagged PDFs in
Grackle Slides</a> is still in beta testing. While there are some export
limitations, Grackle Slides performs accessibility checks that are
valuable.</p>
<p>Grackle Slides performs the following 16 accessibility checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation
<ul>
<li>Presentation title is required</li>
<li>Document language should be specified</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Slides
<ul>
<li>A slide should have a title</li>
<li>Slide title should be unique</li>
<li>A slide should not be empty</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tables
<ul>
<li>Tables should be tagged and described</li>
<li>The use of merged cells is not recommended</li>
<li>The use of empty cells is not recommended</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Elements
<ul>
<li>Images should have alternative text</li>
<li>Elements should have alternative text</li>
<li>Text boxes should not be empty</li>
<li>Lists should not be broken apart</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Content
<ul>
<li>Fine print should be avoided</li>
<li>High color contrast should be used</li>
<li>In-line style changes may lack clear meaning</li>
<li>Empty trailing lines should be removed</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4>How to install Grackle Slides</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.grackledocs.com/how-to-install" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Grackle Slides</a> can be installed from
the <strong>Add-ons</strong> menu of a Google Slides document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Google presentation document</a>.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Add-ons</strong> &gt; <strong>Get Add-ons</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Search for <strong>“Grackle”</strong> in the search field.</li>
<li>Select the add-on and click <strong>Install</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Note:</em> A message will appear requesting access to data that
the add-on needs to work. Review the message and

<h4>How to launch and use Grackle Sheet</h4>
<p>Grackle Sheets is simple to launch and is accessed from the Add-ons
menu.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a Google Slide document.</li>
<li>From the Add-ons menu, select Grackle Slides, then select
Launch.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/gslides-launch-grackle.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1972" width="393" height="288"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the Grackle Slides launch function under the Add-ons menu." /></li>
<li>A sidebar launches that identifies errors and warnings.
<ul>
<li>Clicking on each error and warning will expand the selection and
provide guidance on how to resolve each issue.</li>
<li>Select the “Locate” button on any flagged item will take you to that
line of the document to review.</li>
<li>Continue to review and address each flagged item.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Select the “Re-Check” button at the top of the sidebar to update the
report.</li>
<li>Continue to revise until all checks have passed.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Troubleshooting Grackle Slides</h4>
<p>When testing the Grackle Slides, we found that the plugin would
sometimes error out. Grackle Slides would indicate that the checks are
complete, but the remediation functionality in the Grackle sidebar is
not responsive.</p>
<p>Steps you can take when the Grackle Slide plugin does not function
correctly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export as a Microsoft PowerPoint file</li>
<li>Open a new presentation file.</li>
<li>Go to File &gt; Import slides</li>
<li>Run Grackle again</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> After exporting to PowerPoint, you can run Microsoft’s
built-in accessibility checker.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"></span></p>
<p><span id="chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides12"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h4>To save in a different format</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Download
as</strong></li>
<li>Select format</li>
</ol>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a
href="#chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides11">Technique 11</a>.</p>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ol>
<li>Remove unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;
tags</li>
<li>Check for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-017-google-slides.xhtml_slides11">Technique 11</a>)<br />
<em>Note:</em> you may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help
with this process.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 13. Consider Using Accessibility Support
Applications/Plugins</h2>
<p><em>Disclaimer:</em> This list is provided for information purposes
only. It is not exhaustive and inclusion of an application or plug-in on
the list does not constitute a recommendation or guarantee of
results.<br />

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (December 2019), PowerPoint provides a set of
accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the production of
accessible digital office documents. In addition, PowerPoint includes an
accessibility checking feature.</p>
<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using PowerPoint to
create documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc., and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for PowerPoint is <strong>Office Open XML
(PPTX)</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, PowerPoint offers many other presentation processor and
web format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for
accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are available
for the following formats in <a
href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt1012">Technique 12</a>
(below):</p>
<ul>
<li>MS PowerPoint (PPT)</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users. The application-specific
steps and screenshots in this document were created using Microsoft
PowerPoint 2010 (ver. 14.0.4760.1000, Windows XP, Sept. 2010)  while
creating a PPTX document. Files are also easily saved as other file
formats (see <a
href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt1012">Technique 12</a>,
below).</p>
<p><span id="chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt101"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting. Because templates provide the
starting-point for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you
are unsure whether a template is accessible, you should check a sample
document produced when the template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt1011">Technique 11</a>,
below).</p>
<p>PowerPoint’s default template for new documents is a blank
presentation. If you are connected to the internet, you can access a
variety of blank business presentation templates through Office.com.
These are all accessible by virtue of being blank.</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible templates from scratch
in PowerPoint. As well, you can edit and modify the existing prepackaged
templates, ensuring their accessibility as you do so and saving them as
a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (see <a
href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt1011">Technique 11</a>,
below)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> list, select <strong>PowerPoint
Template</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive <strong>File name</strong> (e.g., “Accessible Sales
Template”) will increase the prominence of the accessibility status. As
well, filling in the text box labeled Tags with the term “accessibility”
will improve its searchability as an accessible file.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSPowerPoint2010_1_0.png" width="515"
height="405"
alt="Image demonstrates location of File name, Save as type, and Tags options in Save As dialog." /><br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p>Only use these steps if you have an accessible template available
(e.g., that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply open a new (blank)
document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Available Templates</strong>, select <strong>My
Templates</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSPowerPoint2010_2.png" width="532" height="213"
alt="Image demonstrates location of New option and My templates icon in File menu." /></li>
<li>In the <strong>New</strong> document dialog, select your accessible
template from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSPowerPoint2010_3_0.png" width="433"
height="252"
alt="Image demonstrates location of template icons in Personal Templates section of New Presentation dialog." /><br />
</strong></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have
chosen an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text, images, etc.),
ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve
accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Set Document Language</h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h4>To change the default language</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Options</strong> from the list in the left window
pane</li>
<li>Select <strong>Language</strong> from the list in the left of the
<strong>Options</strong> dialog</li>
<li>Under <strong>Chose Editing Languages</strong>, select the editing
language you want to use<br />
<em>Note:</em> to add an editing language, select the language from the
drop down list labeled <strong>[Add additional editing
languages]</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Set as Default</strong></li>
<li>Close all Office programs and open them again for the changes to
take effect<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSPowerPoint2010_4_0.png" width="694"
height="525"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Language option, Editing Languages list, Set as default button, and Add additional editing languages option in Options dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Review</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Language</strong> section, select the
<strong>Language</strong> button</li>
<li>Select <strong>Set Proofing Language</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Mark selected text as</strong> box, select the
language from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSPowerPoint2010_5_0.png" width="374"
height="226"
alt="Image demonstrates location of language list in Language dialog." /><br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 3. Use Built-In Layout and Styling Features</h2>
<p>PowerPoint does not provide “True Headings” or “Named Styles” as does
Word.</p>
<h3><span id="chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt1031"></span>3.1
Use Built-In Slide Layouts</h3>
<p>Instead of creating each slide in your presentation by starting from
a blank slide, check whether there is a suitable built-in layout.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The built-in layouts can be more accessible to users
of assistive technologies because these technologies sometimes read the
floating items on the slide in the order that they were placed on the
slide. The built-in layouts have usually taken this into account (e.g.,
“Title” first followed by other items, left to right and from top to
bottom). If you create slide layouts from scratch, it is sometimes
difficult to keep track of the order in which elements were placed.</p>
<h4>To apply “true layout” to a slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Slides</strong> section, select the
<strong>Layout</strong> button</li>
<li>Select the layout you would like to use from the drop down
menu<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSPowerPoint2010_6.png" width="683" height="520"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Home menu, Layout button, and Layout drop-down menu." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2 Customize Using Master Slides</h3>
<p>If a layout must be customized, it is recommended that Master Slides
be used.</p>
<p>Every slide layout in a presentation is defined by its master slide.
A master slide determines the formatting style for various elements of
the slide layout. This includes font styles, character formatting, and
the positioning of elements. Essentially, each master slide acts as a
design template for the slide layout.</p>
<p>If you edit any aspect of the slide layout in the master slide, the
change will affect all slides that were created based on it. For this
reason, it is good practice to edit the master slide and use the slide
layouts before building individual slides. It is essential that you
create and use master slides that meet the accessibility requirements
outlined in this document.</p>
<h4>To create or customize a master slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Master Views</strong> section, select the
<strong>Slide Master</strong> icon</li>
<li>The current slide master with its associate layouts appears<br />
<em>Note:</em> If you have the <strong>Normal</strong> view open, the
slide master is the larger slide image in the slide thumbnail pane. The
associated layouts are positioned beneath the slide master.</li>
<li>Customize the existing master slide and its associated layouts to
suit your needs (e.g., apply a design, theme-based colours, fonts,
effects, backgrounds) ensuring that your changes meet accessibility
requirements</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File</strong> name box, type a file name</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> list, select <strong>PowerPoint
template</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong></li>
<li>On the <strong>Slide Master</strong> tab, in the
<strong>Close</strong> section, select <strong>Close Master View<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSPowerPoint2010_7.png" width="623" height="364"
alt="Image demonstrates Slide Master view." /><br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt104"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 4. Set a Logical Tab Order</h2>
<p>Many presentation applications create content composed almost
exclusively of “floating” objects. This means that they avoid the
transitions between in-line content and secondary “floating” objects
(text boxes, images, etc.) that can cause accessibility issues in word
processors.</p>
<p>However, when you are working with “floating” objects, it is
important to remember that the way objects are positioned in two
dimensions on the screen may be completely different from how the
objects will be read by a screen reader or navigated using a keyboard.
The order that content is navigated sequentially is called the “Tab
Order” because often the “Tab” key is used to navigate from one
“floating” object to the next.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for setting a logical “tab order” for “floating” objects</h4>
<ul>
<li>The tab order of floating objects is usually from the “lowest”
object on the slide to the “highest”.</li>
<li>Because objects automatically appear “on top” when they are
inserted, the default tab order is from the first object inserted to the
last. However, this will change if you use features such as “bring to
front” and “send to back”.</li>
<li>The slide’s main heading should be first in the tab order.</li>
<li>Headings should be placed in the tab order immediately before the
items (text, diagrams, etc.) for which they are acting as a
heading.</li>
<li>Labels should be in the reading order placed immediately before the
objects that they label.</li>
<li>For simple slide layouts, it may be possible to simply insert
objects in a logical tab order.</li>
<li>For more complex layouts, it may be easier to simply create the
slide as usual and then set the tab order (see below).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To set the tab order using the ‘Selection Pane’</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Drawing</strong> section, select <strong>Arrange &gt;
Selection Pane…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Selection and Visibility</strong> pane, all the
elements on the slide are listed in reverse chronological order under
<strong>Shapes on this Slide</strong></li>
<li>Elements can be re-ordered using the Re-order buttons located at the
bottom of the Selection and Visibility pane<br />
<em>Note:</em> The tab order of elements begins at the bottom of the
list and tabs upwards.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Slide Notes</h2>
<p>A useful aspect of presentation applications is the facility to add
notes to slides, which can then be read by assistive technologies. You
can use these slide notes to explain and expand on the contents of your
slides in text format. Slide notes can be created as you build your
presentation.</p>
<h4>To add notes to your slides</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Presentation Views</strong> section, select
<strong>Normal</strong> to ensure that the notes panel is in view<br />
<em>Note:</em> You can then select menu item <strong>Home</strong>, to
access text formatting options</li>
<li>The <strong>Notes Pane</strong> can be found at the bottom of the
window, below the slide</li>
<li>Type and format your notes within the <strong>Notes Pane</strong>
below each slide<br />

</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to of each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text (“Title” in PowerPoint)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the title text (e.g., a summary of the
trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions (“Description” in
PowerPoint)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the object</li>
<li>Select <strong>Format Picture…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Alt Text</strong> option from the list</li>
<li>Fill in the <strong>Title</strong>. If more description is required
(e.g., for a chart or graph), provide a short description in the
<strong>Title</strong> (e.g., a summary of the trend) and more detail in
the <strong>Description</strong>.<br />
<em>Note:</em> If the document is ever saved to HTML, the
<strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> fields are
combined into a single HTML &lt;alt&gt; tag.<br />

<h2>Technique 7. Use Built-In Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible.</li>
<li>If tables are split across pages, set the header to show at the top
of each page. Also, set the table to break between rows instead of in
the middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cells labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page (see <a
href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt104">Technique
4</a>).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To add a table with headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Tables</strong> section, select the
<strong>Tables</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select the number of rows and columns you would like your table to
have</li>
<li>Select the table and a <strong>Table Tools</strong> menu item should
appear</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Table Tools &gt; Design</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Table Style Options</strong> section, select the
<strong>Header Row</strong> check box<br />
<em>Note:</em> Whenever possible, keep tables simple with just 1 row of
headings.</li>
</ol>
<h3>7.2 Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph</strong> section, select the
<strong>Bullets</strong> icon for unordered lists or select the
<strong>Numbering</strong> icon for ordered lists</li>
<li>To select a different list format, select the arrow beside the
icon</li>
<li>Select a format from the format <strong>Library</strong> that
appears in the drop-down menu</li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify list styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph</strong> section, select the arrow beside
the <strong>Bullets</strong> icon for unordered lists or select the
arrow beside the <strong>Numbering</strong> icon for ordered lists</li>
<li>Select <strong>Define New Bullet…</strong> to create a new unordered
list format</li>
<li>Select <strong>Define New Number Format…</strong> to create a new
ordered list format</li>
<li>In the <strong>New Bullet</strong> dialog or the <strong>New Number
Format</strong> dialog, select the list characteristics</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use Columns feature for placing text in columns.<br />
<em>Note:</em> Because columns can be a challenge for users of some
assistive technologies, consider whether a column layout is really
necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Info</strong> from the list in the left window
pane</li>
<li>In the right window pane, select the <strong>Title</strong> text
box</li>
<li>Enter the <strong>Title<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the
properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the
template name, discussed above.</li>
</ol>
<h3>7.5 Slide Titles</h3>
<p>Unique slide titles aid navigation for non-visual users.</p>
<h4>To add a visible title to a slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home.</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Reset</strong> in the <strong>Slides</strong>
section.</li>
<li>Enter a title at the top of the slide.<br />
<em>Note:</em>Slide titles should be unique for clarity and ease of
navigation.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add an invisible title to a slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Enter your title at the top of the slide.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home.</strong></li>
<li>From the Drawing menu, select <strong>Arrange &gt; Selection
Pane</strong>. This will open the <strong>Selection and
Visibility</strong> pane.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Selection and Visibility</strong> pane, click on the
eyeball icon next to the slide title to change visibility settings.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience. All basic
accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your
document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within
your charts. For example, use shape and colour, rather than colour
alone, to convey information. As well, some further steps should be
taken to ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriately
labeled to give users reference points that will help them to correctly
interpret the information.</p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select a <strong>Slide Layout</strong> that contains a placeholder
for a chart (see <a
href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt1031">Technique
3.1</a>, above)</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Insert Chart</strong> icon from the center of the
placeholder</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Chart Type</strong> from the <strong>Insert
Chart</strong> dialog</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><br />
<em>Note:</em> This will open the Excel document titled “Chart in
Microsoft Office PowerPoint”, where you can input the data you would
like to include in the chart. When you have done this, simply close the
Excel window and the data will appear on the chart in the PowerPoint
presentation.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu item:
<strong>Layout</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Labels</strong> section, select the type of title or
label you would like to define (e.g., <strong>Chart Title, Axis Titles,
Data Labels</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a predefined Chart Layout</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu item:
<strong>Design</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Layouts</strong> section, select a
<strong>Quick Layout</strong> from the scrolling <strong>Chart
Layouts</strong> gallery</li>
</ol>
<h4>To change to a different predefined Chart Type</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu item:
<strong>Design</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Type</strong> section, select the <strong>Change
Chart Type</strong> icon</li>
<li>In the <strong>Change Chart Type</strong> dialog, select a chart
type from the left pane</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Chart Design</strong> from the right pane</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are colour blind</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, go to menu item: <strong>Chart Tools &gt;
Format</strong> and in the <strong>Shape Styles</strong> section select
<strong>Shape Fill</strong> to apply a texture to help distinguish the
bars</li>
<li>Change the default colours to a colour safe or gray-scale
palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colours, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_9-2">Technique 9.2</a>,
below)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to be
printed, try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change document details such the pagination, the layout of
tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a reasonable
degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3><span id="chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_9-2"></span>9.2 Use
Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid colour for a text background rather
than a pattern.<br />
In order to determine whether the colours in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php"

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Colour Alone</h3>
<p>Colour should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where colour might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the colour or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the colour of text you have
edited and noting the colour. Instead use PowerPoint’s “Track Changes”
feature to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or colour combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h3>9.6 Avoid Transitions</h3>
<p>Transitions between slides and elements in each slide (e.g., bullets
in a list flying onto the screen) can be distracting to users with
disabilities. It can also cause assistive technologies to read the slide
incorrectly. For these reasons, it is best to avoid transitions
altogether.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt1010"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colours, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own. To make the
address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the
address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h4>To change link text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the link and right-click*</li>
<li>Select <strong>Edit Hyperlink</strong> (Ctrl + K)</li>
<li>Change the text in the <strong>Text to display</strong> box to
something descriptive</li>
</ol>
<h3>10.3 Accessible Presentations</h3>
<p>It is important to consider accessibility before, during, and after
presentations. Below is a helpful link with guidance on how to make
presentations accessible to all:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How to Make Presentations Accessible to All” <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/training/accessible" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">(Source: W3C-WAI Draft)</a></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt1011"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of your document or template
(see <a href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt101">Technique
1</a>, above), PowerPoint offers an “Accessibility Checker” to review
your document against a set of possible issues that users with
disabilities may experience in your file.</p>
<h3>The “Accessibility Checker” classifies issues as:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error</strong> – content that makes a file very difficult or
impossible for people with disabilities to understand</li>
<li><strong>Warning</strong> – content that in most, but not all, cases
makes a file difficult for people with disabilities to understand</li>
<li><strong>Tip</strong> – content that people with disabilities can
understand, but that might be better organized or presented in a way
that would maximize their experience</li>
</ul>
<p>To learn more about the Accessibility Checker and the rules it uses
to identify and classify accessibility issues in your document, visit
the PowerPoint help section (see <a
href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt10acc">Accessibility
Help</a>, below). Use the search term “accessibility checker rules” in
the help search box.</p>
<h4>To use the “Accessibility Checker”</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Info</strong> in the left window pane</li>
<li>Under <strong>Prepare for Sharing</strong>, an alert will appear if
a potential accessibility issue has been detected<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSPowerPoint2010_11.png" width="480" height="271"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Info option and Check for Issues button in File menu." /></li>
<li>To view and repair the issues, select <strong>Check for
Issues</strong> and then <strong>Check Accessibility<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSPowerPoint2010_12.png" width="276" height="205"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Check Accessibility button in Check for Issues drop-down menu." /><br />
</strong></li>
<li>An <strong>Accessibility Checker</strong> task pane will open,
showing the inspection results<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSPowerPoint2010_13.png" width="172" height="187"
alt="Image demonstrates inspection results in Accessibility Checker task pane." /></li>
<li>Select a specific issue to see <strong>Additional

</ol>
<p>In order to get further indication of the accessibility of your
document or template (see <a
href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt101">Technique 1</a>),
then you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order to
perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as described
below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>Another option is to save the document into HTML format and use one
of the web accessibility checkers available online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Acrobat Professional</a></li>
<li><a

<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a
href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt1011">Technique 11</a>
(above).</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save As</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> list, select <strong>PDF or XPS
Document</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Options</strong> button</li>
<li>Under <strong>Include non-printing information</strong> in the
<strong>Options</strong> dialog, ensure that the <strong>Document

</ol>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save As</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> box, select <strong>Web
Page</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong></li>
<li>Check the HTML file for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt1011">Technique 11</a>,
above)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;
tags</li>
<li>Check for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-018-microsoft-powerpoint.xhtml_ppt1011">Technique 11</a>,
above)<br />
<em>Note:</em> you may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help
with this process.</li>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>At the time of testing (January 17, 2011), as long as images are
avoided, PowerPoint for Mac provides a set of accessibility features
that is sufficient to enable the production of accessible digital office
documents. However, PowerPoint 2008 for Mac does not include an
accessibility checking feature.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> Later versions of PowerPoint for Mac
include an accessibility checking feature. For more information, please
see the following:</p>

<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using PowerPoint for Mac
to create documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for PowerPoint for Mac is <strong>Office Open
XML (PPTX)</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, PowerPoint for Mac offers many other presentation
processor and web format saving options. Most of these have not been
checked for accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are
available for the following formats in <a
href="#chapter-019-microsoft-powerpoint-for-mac.xhtml_ppt07-12">Technique
12</a> (below):</p>
<ul>
<li>PPT (MS PowerPoint 97–2004)</li>
<li>POTX (PowerPoint Template)</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>ODP (OpenDocument Presentation)</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<p><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</p>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users.<br />
The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Microsoft PowerPoint 2008 for Mac (ver. 12.0 (071130), Mac
OS X, Jan. 2011)  and Microsoft PowerPoint for Mac (version 16.16.17)
while creating a PPTX document. Files are also easily saved as other
file formats (see <a
href="#chapter-019-microsoft-powerpoint-for-mac.xhtml_ppt07-12">Technique
12</a>, below).</p>
<p>This document is provided for information purposes only and is

<p><span
id="chapter-019-microsoft-powerpoint-for-mac.xhtml_ppt07-1"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-019-microsoft-powerpoint-for-mac.xhtml_ppt07-11">Technique
11</a>, below).</p>
<p>PowerPoint for Mac’s default template for new documents is a blank
presentation. If you are connected to the internet, you can access a
variety of blank business presentation templates through Office.com.
These are all accessible by virtue of being blank.</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible templates from scratch
in PowerPoint for Mac. As well, you can edit and modify the existing
prepackaged templates, ensuring their accessibility as you do so and
saving them as a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (see <a
href="#chapter-019-microsoft-powerpoint-for-mac.xhtml_ppt07-11">Technique
11</a>, below)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save As</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save As</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive <strong>File name</strong> (e.g., “Accessible Sales
Template”) will increase the prominence of the accessibility
status.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Format</strong> list, select <strong>PowerPoint
97–2004 (.pot)</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowrPoint2008forMac_1.png" width="525"
height="241"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Save As box and Format drop-down list in the Save As dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p><em><em>Note:</em></em> Only use these steps if you have an
accessible template available (e.g. that you previously saved).
Otherwise, simply open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Project Gallery…</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Category</strong>, select <strong>My
Templates</strong> (or select where you saved the template)</li>
<li>Select your accessible template from the template gallery</li>
<li>Select <strong>Open</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2008forMac_2.png" width="660"
height="454"
alt="Image demonstrates location of My Templates in Category section and an accessible template in the template gallery of the Project Gallery dialog." /></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have
chosen an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text, images, etc.),
ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve
accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Set Document Language</h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h4>To change the default language</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools &gt; Language</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Mark select text as</strong> box, select the language
from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>Default…</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2008forMac_3.png" width="429"
height="310"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Default... button in the Language dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools &gt; Language…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Mark selected text as</strong> box, select the
language from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2008forMac_4.png" width="419"
height="305"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Mark selected text as scrolling-list in the Language dialog." /><br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 3. Use Built-In Layout and Styling Features</h2>
<p>PowerPoint does not provide “True Headings” or “Named Styles” as does
Word.</p>
<h3><span
id="chapter-019-microsoft-powerpoint-for-mac.xhtml_ppt07-31"></span>3.1
Use Built-In Slide Layouts</h3>
<p>Instead of creating each slide in your presentation by starting from
a blank slide, check whether there is a suitable built-in layout.<br />
<em><em>Note:</em></em> The built-in layouts can be more accessible to
users of assistive technologies because these technologies sometimes
read the floating items on the slide in the order that they were placed
on the slide. The built-in layouts have usually taken this into account
(e.g., “Title” first followed by other items, left to right and from top
to bottom). If you create slide layouts from scratch, it is sometimes
difficult to keep track of the order elements were placed.</p>
<h4>To apply “true layout” to a slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Slide Layout</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Slide Layout</strong> section that opens, select the
layout you would like to use<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2008forMac_5.png" width="712"
height="486"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Slide Layout section above the document pane in the application window." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2 Customize Using Master Slides</h3>
<p>If a layout must be customized, it is recommended that Master Slides
be used.</p>
<p>Every slide layout in a presentation is defined by its master slide.
A master slide determines the formatting style for various elements of
the slide layout. This includes font styles, character formatting, and
the positioning of elements. Essentially, each master slide acts as a
design template for the slide layout.<br />
If you edit any aspect of the slide layout in the master slide, the
change will affect all slides that were created based on it. For this
reason, it is good practice to edit the master slide and use the slide
layouts before building individual slides. It is essential that you
create and use master slides that meet the accessibility requirements
outlined in this document.</p>
<h4>To create or customize a master slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Master &gt; Slide
Master</strong></li>
<li>The current slide master with its associate layouts appears<br />
<em><em>Note:</em></em> If you have the <strong>Normal</strong> view
open, the slide master is the larger slide image in the slide thumbnail
pane. The associated layouts are positioned beneath the slide
master.</li>
<li>Customize the existing master slide and its associated layouts to
suit your needs (e.g., apply a design, theme-based colors, fonts,
effects, backgrounds) ensuring that your changes meet accessibility
requirements</li>
<li>To create a new master slide, select the <strong>Insert New
Master</strong> icon</li>
<li>On the <strong>Slide Master</strong> toolbar, select <strong>Close
Master</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2008forMac_6.png" width="786"
height="565"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Insert New Master option beside the Close Master option in the Master toolbar of the Master View." /></li>
</ol>
<p><span
id="chapter-019-microsoft-powerpoint-for-mac.xhtml_ppt07-4"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 4. Set a Logical Tab Order</h2>
<p>Many presentation applications create content composed almost
exclusively of “floating” objects. This means that they avoid the
transitions between in-line content and secondary “floating” objects
(text boxes, images, etc.) that can cause accessibility issues in word
processors.</p>
<p>However, when you are working with “floating” objects, it is
important to remember that the way objects are positioned in two
dimensions on the screen may be completely different from how the
objects will be read by a screen reader or navigated using a keyboard.
The order that content is navigated sequentially is called the “Tab
Order” because often the “Tab” key is used to navigate from one
“floating” object to the next.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for setting a logical “tab order” for “floating” objects</h4>
<ul>
<li>The tab order of floating objects is usually from the “lowest”
object on the slide to the “highest”.</li>
<li>Because objects automatically appear “on top” when they are
inserted, the default tab order is from the first object inserted to the
last. However, this will change if you use features such as “bring to
front” and “send to back”.</li>
<li>The slide’s main heading should be first in the tab order.</li>
<li>Headings should be placed in the tab order immediately before the
items (text, diagrams, etc.) for which they are acting as a
heading.</li>
<li>Labels should be in the reading order placed immediately before the
objects that they label.</li>
<li>For simple slide layouts, it may be possible to simply insert
objects in a logical tab order.</li>
<li>For more complex layouts, it may be easier to simply to create the
slide as usual and then set the tab order (see below).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h3>To set the tab order</h3>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the image or object</li>
<li>Select <strong>Order</strong> &gt; <strong>Bring to Front</strong>,
<strong>Send to back</strong>, <strong>Bring Forward</strong> or
<strong>Send Backward</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Slide Notes</h2>
<p>A useful aspect of presentation applications is the facility to add
notes to slides, which can then be read by assistive technologies. You
can use these slide notes to explain and expand on the contents of your
slides in text format. Slide notes can be created as you build your
presentation.</p>
<h3>To add notes to your slides</h3>
<ol>
<li>To ensure the notes panel is in view, go to menu item: <strong>View
&gt; Normal</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Notes Pane</strong> can be found at the bottom of the
window, below the slide</li>
<li>Type and format your notes within the <strong>Notes Pane</strong>
below each slide<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2008forMac_7.png" width="634"
height="489"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Notes Pane in the normal view." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to of each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Select the object, then choose one of the options below:
<ul>
<li>Right-click the object and select <strong>Edit Alt Text…</strong>.
The <strong>Alt Text</strong> pane opens.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/ms-alt-text-menu.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2140" width="200" height="282"
alt="Image demonstrates the right-click context menu with &quot;Edit Alt Text...&quot; selected." />
<ul>
<li><em>Note:</em> If the <strong>Edit Alt Text…</strong> option is not
visible, select <strong>Format Object/Picture</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alternately, select an object. In the menu, select the object’s
<strong>Format</strong> tab. Then, select <strong>Alt
Text</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the <strong>Alt Text</strong> pane, add the alternative text to
the <strong>Description</strong> field.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Format-Picure.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2141" width="300" height="418"
alt="Image demonstrates the Alt Text section of the Format Picture pane." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 7. Use Built-In Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible. Whenever
possible, use just one row of headings.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cells labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page (see <a
href="#chapter-019-microsoft-powerpoint-for-mac.xhtml_ppt07-4">Technique
4</a>).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To insert a table with header rows:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Table…</strong></li>
<li>Select the number of columns and rows</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Table Styles</strong> section that opens above the
document pane, select the <strong>Options</strong> drop-down menu</li>
<li>Select <strong>Header Row</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2008forMac_8.png" width="651"
height="405"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Header Row Option in Table Styles section above document pane." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.2 Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text</li>
<li>If the <strong>Formatting Palette</strong> is not in view, go to
menu item: <strong>View &gt; Toolbox, Formatting Palette</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Formatting Palette</strong>, select <strong>Bullets
and Numbering</strong> if it is not already open</li>
<li>In the <strong>Bullets and Numbering</strong> section, select
<strong>Type, Bullets</strong> for bulleted lists or <strong>Type,
Numbering</strong> for numbered lists</li>
<li>To change the style, select a list style from the
<strong>Style</strong> drop-down list<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2008forMac_9.png" width="250"
height="320"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Bullets and Numbering section in Formatting Palette." /></li>
</ol>
<p>At this time, it is not possible to modify pre-formatted list styles
or to create your own list styles. <strong>[Tested: January 26,
2011]</strong></p>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use Columns feature for placing text in columns. However, because
columns can be a challenge for users of some assistive technologies,
consider whether a column layout is really necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties</strong></li>
<li>Enter the <strong>Title</strong> in the <strong>Title</strong> text
box</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
</strong><em><em>Note:</em></em> The title defined in the properties is
different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the template name,
discussed above.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2008forMac_10.png" width="469"
height="485"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Title box in Presentation Properties dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience. All basic
accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your
document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within
your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color alone,
to convey information. As well, some further steps should be taken to
ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give
users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the
information.</p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select a <strong>Slide Layout</strong> that contains a placeholder
for a chart (see <a
href="#chapter-019-microsoft-powerpoint-for-mac.xhtml_ppt07-31">Technique
3.1</a>, above)</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Insert Chart</strong> icon from the center of the
placeholder</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Chart Type</strong> from the
<strong>Charts</strong> section above the document pane<br />
<em><em>Note:</em></em> This will open the Excel document titled “Chart
in Microsoft Office PowerPoint”, where you can input the data you would
like to include in the chart. When you have done this, simply close the
Excel window and the data will appear on the chart in the PowerPoint
presentation.<br />
<em><em>Note:</em></em> This applies a predefined Chart Layout, which
can be changed at any time simply by selecting the chart and following
<strong>Steps 2 and 3</strong> above.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the chart</li>
<li>If the <strong>Formatting Palette</strong> is not open, go to menu
item: <strong>View &gt; Toolbox, Formatting Palette</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Chart Options</strong> to open the <strong>Chart
Options</strong> section, if it is not already open</li>
<li>Under <strong>Titles</strong>, select the title from the
<strong>Chart Title</strong> drop-down list or enter a title in the text
box below the drop-down list</li>
<li>Under <strong>Other options</strong>, select the
<strong>Labels</strong> and <strong>Legends</strong> you would like to
include from their respective drop-down lists</li>
<li>Under <strong>Chart Data</strong>, select <strong>Data Table with
Legend Keys</strong> from the <strong>Data Table</strong> drop-down list
to include a data table to help further support the chart</li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, go to menu item: <strong>Chart Tools &gt;
Format</strong> and in the <strong>Shape Styles</strong> section select
<strong>Shape Fill</strong> to apply a texture to help distinguish the
bars</li>
<li>Change the default colors to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-019-microsoft-powerpoint-for-mac.xhtml_ppt07-92">Technique
9.2</a>, below)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in? </strong>Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3><span
id="chapter-019-microsoft-powerpoint-for-mac.xhtml_ppt07-92"></span>9.2
Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.<br />
In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php"

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use PowerPoint for Mac’s “Track
Changes” feature to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g. “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h3>9.6 Avoid Transitions</h3>
<p>Transitions between slides and elements in each slide (e.g., bullets
in a list flying onto the screen) can be distracting to users with
disabilities. It can also cause assistive technologies to read the slide
incorrectly. For these reasons, it is best to avoid transitions
altogether.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own. To make the
address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the
address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h3>To change link text</h3>
<ol>
<li>Type (or paste in) a web address and press spacebar or “Enter” to
convert into a hyperlink</li>
<li>Highlight the link</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Hyperlink…</strong></li>
<li>Edit the text in the <strong>Display</strong> box</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2008forMac_11.png" width="656"

</ol>
<h3>10.3 Accessible Presentations</h3>
<p>It is important to consider accessibility before, during, and after
presentations. Below is a helpful link with guidance on how to make
presentations accessible to all:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>At this time, PowerPoint 2008 for Mac does not offer a mechanism to
check for potential accessibility errors in your document prior to
publishing. <strong>[Tested: January 17, 2011]</strong></p>
<p>In order to get some indication of your document or template (see <a
href="#chapter-019-microsoft-powerpoint-for-mac.xhtml_ppt07-1">Technique
1</a>), then you may consider saving the file into HTML in order to
perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as described
below.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (January 10, 2011), PowerPoint 2007 provides a
set of accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the
production of accessible digital office documents. However, PowerPoint
2007 does not include an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using PowerPoint 2007 to
create documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for PowerPoint 2007 is <strong>Office Open
XML (PPTX)</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, PowerPoint 2007 offers many other presentation processor
and web format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for
accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are available
for the following formats in <a
href="#chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-12">Technique
12</a> (below):</p>
<ul>
<li>MS PowerPoint (PPT)</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 (ver. 12.0.6535.5002, Windows 7,
Jan. 2011) while creating a PPTX document. Files are also easily saved
as other file formats (see <a
href="#chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-12">Technique
12</a>, below).</p>
<p>This document is provided for information purposes only and is
neither a recommendation nor a guarantee of results. If errors are
found, please report them to: <a
href="mailto:adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca">adod-comments@idrc.ocad.ca</a>.</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-1"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-11">Technique
11</a>, below).</p>
<p>PowerPoint 2007’s default template for new documents is a blank
presentation. If you are connected to the internet, you can access a
variety of blank business presentation templates through Office.com.
These are all accessible by virtue of being blank.</p>
<p>It is possible to create your own accessible templates from scratch
in PowerPoint 2007. As well, you can edit and modify the existing
prepackaged templates, ensuring their accessibility as you do so and
saving them as a new template.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (see <a
href="#chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-11">Technique
11</a>, below)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; Other
Formats</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> list, select <strong>PowerPoint
Template</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive <strong>File name</strong> (e.g., “Accessible Sales
Template”) will increase the prominence of the accessibility status. As
well, filling in the text box labeled Tags with the term “accessibility”
will improve its searchability as an accessible file.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p>Only use these steps if you have an accessible template available
(e.g., that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply open a new (blank)
document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; New</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Templates</strong>, select <strong>My
templates…</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2007_1.png" width="461" height="276"
alt="Image demonstrates location of My templates... option under Templates in New Presentation dialog." /></li>
<li>In the <strong>New Presentation</strong> dialog, select your
accessible template from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/MSPowerPoint2010_3_8.png" width="563"
height="309"
alt="Image demonstrates location of template icons in Personal Templates section of New Presentation dialog." /><br />
</strong></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have
chosen an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point. <strong>As you add your content (e.g., text, images, etc.),
ensure that you consult the sections that follow to preserve
accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Set Document Language</h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h4>To change the default language</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the operating system, activate the keyboard layout for the
language in which you want to create and edit text</li>
<li>Right-click* the status bar at the bottom of the window, ensure that
<strong>Language</strong> is selected, this displays a reminder of the
active keyboard layout in the status bar<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2007_2.png" width="621" height="443"
alt="Image demonstrates location of active keyboard layout in the status bar of the application window." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Review</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Proofing</strong> section, select the
<strong>Language</strong> button</li>
<li>In the <strong>Mark selected text as</strong> box, select the
language from the list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 3. Use Built-In Layout and Styling Features</h2>
<p>PowerPoint 2007 does not provide “True Headings” or “Named Styles” as

id="chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-31"></span>3.1 Use
Built-In Slide Layouts</h3>
<p>Instead of creating each slide in your presentation by starting from
a blank slide, check whether there is a suitable built-in layout.<br />
<em>Note:</em> The built-in layouts can be more accessible to users of
assistive technologies because technologies sometimes read the floating
items on the slide in the order that they were placed on the slide. The
built-in layouts have usually taken this into account (e.g., “Title”
first followed by other items, left to right and from top to bottom). If
you create slide layouts from scratch, it is sometimes difficult to keep
track of the order elements were placed.</p>
<h4>To apply “true layout” to a slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Slides</strong> section, select the
<strong>Layout</strong> button</li>
<li>Select the layout you would like to use from the drop down
menu<br />

alt="Image demonstrates location of Slides section, Layout button, and Layout gallery in the Home menu." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2 Customize Using Master Slides</h3>
<p>If a layout must be customized, it is recommended that Master Slides
be used.</p>
<p>Every slide layout in a presentation is defined by its master slide.
A master slide determines the formatting style for various elements of
the slide layout. This includes font styles, character formatting, and
the positioning of elements. Essentially, each master slide acts as a
design template for the slide layout.</p>
<p>If you edit any aspect of the slide layout in the master slide, the
change will affect all slides that were created based on it. For this
reason, it is good practice to edit the master slide and use the slide
layouts before building individual slides. It is essential that you
create and use master slides that meet the accessibility requirements
outlined in this document.</p>
<h4>To create or customize a master slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Presentation Views</strong> section, select the
<strong>Slide Master</strong> icon</li>
<li>The current slide master with its associate layouts appears<br />
<em>Note:</em> If you have the <strong>Normal</strong> view open, the
slide master is the larger slide image in the slide thumbnail pane. The
associated layouts are positioned beneath the slide master.</li>
<li>Customize the existing master slide and its associated layouts to
suit your needs (e.g., apply a design, theme-based colors, fonts,
effects, backgrounds) ensuring that your changes meet accessibility
requirements</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; Other
Formats</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Filename</strong> box, type a file name</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> list, select <strong>PowerPoint
template</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong></li>
<li>On the <strong>Slide Master</strong> tab, in the
<strong>Close</strong> section, select <strong>Close Master View<br />
</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 4. Set a Logical Tab Order</h2>
<p>Many presentation applications create content composed almost
exclusively of “floating” objects. This means that they avoid the
transitions between in-line content and secondary “floating” objects
(text boxes, images, etc.) that can cause accessibility issues in word
processors.</p>
<p>However, when you are working with “floating” objects, it is
important to remember that the way objects are positioned in two
dimensions on the screen may be completely different from how the
objects will be read by a screen reader or navigated using a keyboard.
The order that content is navigated sequentially is called the “Tab
Order” because often the “Tab” key is used to navigate from one
“floating” object to the next.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for setting a logical “tab order” for “floating” objects</h4>
<ul>
<li>The tab order of floating objects is usually from the “lowest”
object on the slide to the “highest”.</li>
<li>Because objects automatically appear “on top” when they are
inserted, the default tab order is from the first object inserted to the
last. However, this will change if you use features such as “bring to
front” and “send to back”.</li>
<li>The slide’s main heading should be first in the tab order.</li>
<li>Headings should be placed in the tab order immediately before the
items (text, diagrams, etc.) for which they are acting as a
heading.</li>
<li>Labels should be in the reading order placed immediately before the
objects that they label.</li>
<li>For simple slide layouts, it may be possible to simply insert
objects in a logical tab order.</li>
<li>For more complex layouts, it may be easier to simply to create the
slide as usual and then set the tab order (see below).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To set the tab order using the ‘Selection Pane’</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Drawing</strong> section, select <strong>Arrange &gt;
Selection Pane…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Selection and Visibility</strong> pane, all the
elements on the slide are listed in reverse chronological order under
<strong>Shapes on this Slide</strong></li>
<li>Elements can be re-ordered using the <strong>Re-order</strong>
buttons located at the bottom of the <strong>Selection and
Visibility</strong> pane<br />
<em>Note:</em> The tab order of elements begins at the bottom of the
list and tabs upwards.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2007_7.png" width="666" height="424"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Arrange option, reverse chronological list of elements in the Selection and Visibility pane, and Re-order buttons." /></li>
</ol>
<p><span
id="chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-5"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Slide Notes</h2>
<p>A useful aspect of presentation applications is the facility to add
notes to slides, which can then be read by assistive technologies. You
can use these slide notes to explain and expand on the contents of your
slides in text format. Slide notes can be created as you build your
presentation.</p>
<h4>To add notes to your slides</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Presentation Views</strong> section, select
<strong>Normal</strong> to ensure that the notes panel is in view<br />
<em>Note:</em> You can then select menu item <strong>Home</strong>, to
access text formatting options</li>
<li>The <strong>Notes Pane</strong> can be found at the bottom of the
window, below the slide</li>
<li>Type and format your notes within the <strong>Notes Pane</strong>
below each slide<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2007_2.png" width="624" height="456"
alt="Image demonstrates location of View menu, Normal button, and notes section." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to of each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text to images and graphical objects</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the object</li>
<li>Select <strong>Size and Position…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Alt Text</strong> tab</li>
<li>Fill in the <strong>Alternative text</strong> box<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2007_4.png" width="386" height="466"

</ol>
<p><span
id="chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-7"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 7. Use Built-In Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible. Whenever
possible, use just one row of headings.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cells labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page (see <a
href="#chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-5">Technique
5</a>).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To add a table with headings</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Tables</strong> section, select the
<strong>Tables</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select the number of rows and columns you would like your table to
have</li>
<li>Select the table and a <strong>Table Tools</strong> menu item should
appear</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Table Tools &gt; Design</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Table Style Options</strong> section, select the
<strong>Header Row</strong> check box</li>
</ol>
<h3>7.2 Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph</strong> section, select the
<strong>Bullets</strong> icon for unordered lists or select the
<strong>Numbering</strong> icon for ordered lists</li>
<li>To select a different list format, select the arrow beside the
icon</li>
<li>Select a format from the format <strong>Library</strong> that
appears in the drop-down menu</li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify list styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Home</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Paragraph</strong> section, select the arrow beside
the <strong>Bullets</strong> icon for unordered lists or select the
arrow beside the <strong>Numbering</strong> icon for ordered lists</li>
<li>Select <strong>Define New Bullet…</strong> to create a new unordered
list format</li>
<li>Select <strong>Define New Number Format…</strong> to create a new
ordered list format</li>
<li>In the <strong>New Bullet</strong> dialog or the <strong>New Number
Format</strong> dialog, select the list characteristics</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use Columns feature for placing text in columns. However, because
columns can be a challenge for users of some assistive technologies, you
should consider whether a column layout is really necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Prepare &gt;
Properties</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Document Properties</strong> section that appears,
select the <strong>Title</strong> text box</li>
<li>Enter the Title<strong><br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the
properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the
template name, discussed above.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/PowerPoint2007_5.png" width="480" height="356"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Title text box in the Document Properties section." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to display data in meaningful ways for your
audience. It is important to ensure that your chart is as accessible as
possible to all members of your audience. All basic accessibility
considerations that are applied to the rest of your document must also
be applied to your charts and the elements within your charts. For
example, use shape and color, rather than color alone, to convey
information. As well, some further steps should be taken to ensure that
the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give users
reference points that will help to correctly interpret the
information.</p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select a <strong>Slide Layout</strong> that contains a placeholder
for a chart (see <a
href="#chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-31">Technique
3.1</a>, above)</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Insert Chart</strong> icon from the center of the
placeholder</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Chart Type</strong> from the <strong>Chart
Gallery</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> This will open the Excel document titled “Chart
in Microsoft Office PowerPoint”, where you can input the data you would
like to include in the chart. When you have done this, simply close the
Excel window and the data will appear on the chart in the PowerPoint
presentation.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu item:
<strong>Layout</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Labels</strong> section, select the type of title or
label you would like to define (e.g., <strong>Chart Title, Axis Titles,
Data Labels</strong>)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a predefined Chart Layout</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu item:
<strong>Design</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Layouts</strong> section, select a
<strong>Quick Layout</strong> from the scrolling <strong>Chart
Layouts</strong> gallery</li>
</ol>
<h4>To change to a different predefined Chart Type</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Tools</strong> menu section, go to menu item:
<strong>Design</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Type</strong> section, select the <strong>Change
Chart Type</strong> icon</li>
<li>In the <strong>Change Chart Type</strong> dialog, select a chart
type from the left pane</li>
<li>Select a <strong>Chart Design</strong> from the right pane</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Other Chart Considerations</h4>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, go to menu item: <strong>Chart Tools &gt;
Format</strong> and in the <strong>Shape Styles</strong> section select
<strong>Shape Fill</strong> to apply a texture to help distinguish the
bars</li>
<li>Change the default colors to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-92">Technique
9.2</a>, below)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3><span
id="chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-92"></span>9.2 Use
Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.<br />
In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php"

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use PowerPoint 2007’s “Track
Changes” feature to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h3>9.6 Avoid Transitions</h3>
<p>Transitions between slides and elements in each slide (e.g., bullets
in a list flying onto the screen) can be distracting to users with
disabilities. It can also cause assistive technologies to read the slide
incorrectly. For these reasons, it is best to avoid transitions
altogether.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own. To make the
address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the
address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h4>To change link text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Highlight the link and right-click*</li>
<li>Select <strong>Edit Hyperlink</strong> (Ctrl + K)</li>
<li>Change the text in the <strong>Text to display</strong> box to
something descriptive</li>
</ol>
<h3>10.3 Accessible Presentations</h3>
<p>It is important to consider accessibility before, during, and after
presentations. Below is a helpful link with guidance on how to make
presentations accessible to all:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How to Make Presentations Accessible to All” <a

<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>At this time, Powerpoint 2007 does not offer a mechanism to check for
potential accessibility errors in your document prior to publishing.
<strong>[Tested: January 10th, 2011]</strong></p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document
or template (see <a
href="#chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-1">Technique
1</a>), then you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order
to perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as described
below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>Another option is to save the document into HTML format and use one
of the web accessibility checkers available online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Acrobat Professional</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://commonlook.com/accessibility-software/pdf-validator"

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF Accessibility Checker
(PAC)</a> – a free alternative provided by “Access for all”</li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full
Check…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Full Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking
option</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Start Checking</strong> button</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a
href="#chapter-020-microsoft-powerpoint-2007.xhtml_ppt7-11">Technique
11</a> (above).</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; PDF or

<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Options</strong> button</li>
<li>Under <strong>Include non-printing information</strong> in the
<strong>Options</strong> dialog, ensure that the <strong>Document
structure tags for accessibility</strong> check box is selected</li>
<li>Under <strong>PDF options</strong>, ensure that <strong>Bitmap text

</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Office &gt; Save As &gt; Other
Formats</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>File name</strong> box, type a name for the file</li>
<li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> box, select <strong>Web

</ol>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (September 30, 2010), Keynote ’09 lacks
several features that enable accessible office document authoring, most
notably: the ability to add alternative text to images and objects,
indicating natural language, quick styles or named styles, and change
tracking. As a result, some of the other features that might otherwise
support accessibility, such as its extensive templates are not as
effective. In addition, Keynote ‘09 does not include an accessibility
checking feature, which is a more advanced accessibility feature.</p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> In later versions of Keynote, users
can add alt text to images and objects. Apple has added significant
accessibility improvements to its iWork applications, but an
accessibility checker is not a feature yet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using Keynote ’09 to
create documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Keynote ‘09 is the native <strong>iWork
format</strong>. In addition, Keynote ‘09 offers many other presentation
processor and web format saving options. Most of these have not been
checked for accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are
available for the following formats in <a
href="#chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key12">Technique 12</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MS PowerPoint (PPT)</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users. The application-specific
steps and screenshots in this document were created using iWork Keynote
‘09 (ver.5.0.3(791), Mac OS X, Sept. 2010) and Keynote, version 9.1
(December 2019) while producing a document in the proprietary file
format. Files are also easily saved as other file formats (see <a
href="#chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key12">Technique 12</a>).</p>
<p><span id="chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key1"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>All office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as
a blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting. Because templates provide the
starting-point for so many documents, accessibility is critical. If you
are unsure whether a template is accessible, you should check a sample
document produced when the template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key11">Technique 11</a>). The default
template for new documents in Keynote ‘09 is a blank presentation. If
you are connected to the internet, you can access a variety of blank
business presentation templates. These are all accessible by virtue of
being blank. As well, you may create your own templates.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New</strong> or <strong>File &gt;
New from Theme Chooser…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Theme Chooser</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>White</strong> theme or select one of the other existing
template designs</li>
<li>A new document in your selected template style will open</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (see <a href="#chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key11">Technique
11</a>)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Save Theme…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save As</strong> box, type a name for the template.
Using a descriptive template name (e.g. “Accessible Memo Template”) will
increase the prominence of the accessibility status.</li>
<li>Specify a folder in which to save your template. <em>Note:</em> By
default, it will be saved in your home folder in Library/Application
Support/iWork/Keynote/Templates/My Templates pane of the
<strong>Template Chooser</strong>. To save the template in a different
location than the default, create a new folder in the
<strong>Templates</strong> folder. The folder name is then used as a
template category in the <strong>Template Chooser.</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Keynote09_1.png" width="335" height="104"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Save As box and Where option." /></li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible
template available (e.g. that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply
open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New from Theme
Chooser…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Template Chooser</strong> dialog, select <strong>My
Templates</strong> from the left pane</li>
<li>Select your accessible template and click
<strong><strong>Choose<br />
</strong></strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/Keynote09_2.png" width="223"
height="221"
alt="Image demonstrates location of My template option and template icons in Template Chooser dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Set Document Language</h2>
<p>At this time, it is not possible to manually indicate the natural
language for specific slides or sections of text in Keynote ‘09. As
well, it is not possible to change the natural language of the document
itself from the default language. <strong>[Tested: September 30th,
2010]</strong></p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> In later versions of Keynote, users
are able to set a presentation’s language.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose File &gt; Advanced &gt; Language &amp; Region (from the File
menu at the top of your screen).</li>
<li>In the dialog that appears, click the pop-up menus and choose a
language and a region.<br />
<em>Note:</em><span style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em">You can’t
change this setting for a shared presentation.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em">Click
OK.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>For more details, see <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH28043"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to change a presentation’s
language and formatting</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h2>Technique 3. Use Built-In Layout and Styling Features</h2>
<h3>3.1 Use Built-In Slide Layouts</h3>
<p>Instead of creating each slide in your presentation by starting from
a blank slide, check whether there is a suitable built-in layout.
<em>Note:</em> The built-in layouts can be more accessible to users of
assistive technologies because they technologies sometimes read the
floating items on the slide in the order that they were placed on the
slide. The built-in layouts have usually taken this into account (e.g.,
“Title” first followed by other items, left to right and from top to
bottom). If you create slide layouts from scratch, it is sometimes
difficult to keep track of the order elements were placed.
<em>Note:</em> Each slide in Keynote ’09 is derived from a Master Slide
(<a href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml#tech3.1">Technique
3.2</a>) applying “true layouts” requires that you use Master Slides
that are accessible and appropriately designed for your purposes.</p>
<h3><span id="chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key3.2"></span>3.2 Customize
Using Master Slides</h3>
<p>If a layout must be customized, it is recommended that Master Slides
be used. Every slide layout in a presentation is defined by its master
slide. A master slide determines the formatting style for various
elements of the slide layout. This includes font styles, character
formatting, and the positioning of elements. Essentially, each master
slide acts as a design template for the slide layout. If you edit any
aspect of the slide layout in the master slide, the change will affect
all slides that were created based on it. For this reason, it is good
practice to edit the master slide and use the slide layouts before
building individual slides. It is essential that you create and use
master slides that meet the accessibility requirements outlined in this
document.</p>
<h4>To create or customize a master slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the slide Note: To design a master slide from scratch, select
a blank slide to start with. Otherwise, select a slide that resembles
how you would like your slide to look and be sure to modify the slide
characteristics to align with accessibility guidelines in this
document.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show Master Slides</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Master Slide Navigator</strong> in the left pane,
select the <strong>Master Slide Layout</strong> you would like to
modify<img src="OEBPS/assets/Keynote09_3.png" width="216" height="298"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Master Slide Layouts in Master Slides view." /></li>
<li>Customize the master slide to suit your needs (e.g., define
placeholders for text, change background elements, add alignment guides,
and more) ensuring that your changes meet accessibility
requirements</li>
</ol>
<h4>To define default attributes of text and objects</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the slide Note: To design a master slide from scratch, select

(element type) for All Masters</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key4"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 4. Set a Logical Tab Order</h2>
<p>Many presentation applications create content composed almost
exclusively of “floating” objects. This means that they avoid the
transitions between in-line content and secondary “floating” objects
(text boxes, images, etc.) that can cause accessibility issues in word
processors. However, when you are working with “floating” objects, it is
important to remember that the way objects are positioned in two
dimensions on the screen may be completely different from how the
objects will be read by a screen reader or navigated using a keyboard.
The order that content is navigated sequentially is called the “Tab
Order” because often the “Tab” key is used to navigate from one
“floating” object to the next.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for setting a logical “tab order” for “floating” objects</h4>
<ul>
<li>The tab order of floating objects is usually from the “lowest”
object on the slide to the “highest”.</li>
<li>Because objects automatically appear “on top” when they are
inserted, the default tab order is from the first object inserted to the
last. However, this will change if you use features such as “bring to
front” and “send to back”.</li>
<li>The slide’s main heading should be first in the tab order.</li>
<li>Headings should be placed in the tab order immediately before the
items (text, diagrams, etc.) for which they are acting as a
heading.</li>
<li>Labels should be in the reading order placed immediately before the
objects that they label.</li>
<li>For simple slide layouts, it may be possible to simply insert
objects in a logical tab order.</li>
<li>For more complex layouts, it may be easier to simply to create the
slide as usual and then set the tab order (see below).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To set the tab order</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the object</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Arrange &gt; Bring Forward</strong>,
<strong>Bring to Front</strong>, <strong>Send Backward</strong> or
<strong>Send to Back</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Slide Notes</h2>
<p>A useful aspect of presentation applications is the facility to add
notes to slides, which can then be read by assistive technologies. You
can use these slide notes to explain and expand on the contents of your
slides in text format. Slide notes can be created as you build your
presentation.</p>
<h4>To add notes to your slides</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show Presenter
Notes</strong></li>
<li>In the pane at the bottom of the window (below the slide), enter
notes to accompany each slide</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>At this time, Keynote ’09 does not offer a mechanism which enables
the user to add alternative text descriptions to images or objects.
<strong>[Tested: September 28, 2010]</strong></p>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note: </strong>For later versions of Keynote, users
can add alternative text descriptions for images and objects.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the image and go to the <strong>Format</strong> side bar.
Click on the image tab.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Description</strong> text box, then enter your
text.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more details, see the section on <a
href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/keynote/tan77aea6844/mac"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how to add an image
description</a> on the Keynote User Guide for Mac.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text of each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</section>
<h2>Technique 7. Use Built-In Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cells labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page (see <a
href="#chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key4">Technique 4</a>).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To set default table attributes</h4>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show Master Slides</strong></li>
<li>Select a master slide from the <strong>Master Slides
Navigator</strong> in the left pane<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Keynote09_6.png"
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em" width="216" height="298"

<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, select <strong>Table
inspector</strong></li>
<li>Click the <strong>Table</strong> tab</li>
<li>In the <strong>Headers &amp; Footers</strong> section, select
<strong>Choose the number of header columns</strong> or <strong>Choose
the number of header rows</strong> drop-down menus</li>
<li>Select the number of headers<br />
<em>Note:</em> Limiting your table to one row or column of header will
ensure your table remains clear and easy to interpret by assistive
technologies.<br />

style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em" width="236" height="169"
alt="Image demonstrates Table icon, Table tab, and Headers &amp; Footer section in Inspector dialog." /></li>
<li>Customize the other characteristics of your table through the other
sections of the <strong>Table inspector</strong> dialog</li>
<li>To make the table a default for your current master slide, go to
menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Advanced &gt; Define Table for Current
Master<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> To make the table a default for all master
slides, go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Advanced &gt; Define Table
for All Masters</strong><span
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em">Note: Defining the table as a
default for all masters means that when you insert a Table element into
any slide, it will display your preformatted characteristics (including
appropriate headers)</span></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.2 Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text box or highlight the text</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show Inspector</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, click <strong>Text
inspector</strong></li>
<li>Click the <strong>Bullets</strong> tab</li>
<li>In the <strong>Bullets &amp; Numbering</strong> section, click the
drop-down menu and choose a bullet or numbering option</li>
<li>Customize the list style accordingly, ensuring your selections align
with the guidelines in this document<img
src="OEBPS/assets/Keynote09_9.png" width="173" height="115"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Text inspector button, Bullets tab, and Bullets &amp; Numbering section of Inspector dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use Columns feature for placing text in columns. <em>Note:</em>
Because columns can be a challenge for users of some assistive
technologies, consider whether a column layout is really necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Toolbar</strong>, select
<strong>Inspector</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Document inspector</strong> button</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Spotlight</strong> tab</li>
<li>In the <strong>Title</strong> box, type a descriptive name for the
document <em>Note:</em> The <strong>Title</strong> defined in the
properties is different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the
template name, discussed above.<br />

<h2>Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience. All basic
accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your
document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within
your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color alone,
to convey information. As well, some further steps should be taken to
ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give
users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the
information.</p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Chart</strong></li>
<li>Select the type of chart you want to use</li>
<li>Update the <strong>Chart Data Editor</strong> with the data you
would like to display</li>
<li>Close the <strong>Chart Data Editor</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the chart</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show Inspector</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Inspector</strong>, select
<strong>Chart</strong></li>
<li>Ensure the <strong>Show Title</strong> and <strong>Show
Legend</strong> check boxes are selected</li>
<li>Select <strong>Axis</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Value Axis (Y)</strong> and <strong>Category Axis
(X)</strong>, select <strong>Show Title</strong> and <strong>Show Value
Labels</strong> from their respective drop-down menus</li>
</ol>
<h4>To change to a different predefined Chart Type</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the chart</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show Inspector</strong></li>
<li>Select a chart type from the <strong>Choose a chart type</strong>
drop-down menu</li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply texture instead of
color to differentiate the bars</li>
<li>Change the default colors to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key92">Technique 9.2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to be
printed, try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3><span id="chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key92"></span>9.2 Use Sufficient
Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern. In order to determine whether the colors in your
document have sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast
checker, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use PowerPoint 2010’s “Track
Changes” feature to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h3>9.6 Avoid Transitions</h3>
<p>Transitions between slides and elements in each slide (e.g., bullets
in a list flying onto the screen) can be distracting to users with
disabilities. It can also cause assistive technologies to read the slide
incorrectly. For these reasons, it is best to avoid transitions
altogether.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own. To make the
address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the
address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h4>To edit hyperlink text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Enter the hyperlink</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show Inspector</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Inspector</strong> dialog, click <strong>Hyperlink
inspector</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Display</strong> box, enter the text you would like
to display<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Keynote09_11.png" width="187" height="139"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Hyperlink inspector button and Display text box in Inspector dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>10.3 Accessible Presentations</h3>
<p>It is important to consider accessibility before, during, and after
presentations. Below is a helpful link with guidance on how to make
presentations accessible to all:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How to Make Presentations Accessible to All” <a

</ul>
<p><span id="chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key11"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>At this time, Keynote ’09 does not offer a mechanism to check for
potential accessibility errors in your document prior to publishing.
<strong>[Tested: September 30th, 2010]</strong> In order to get some
indication of the accessibility of your document or template (see <a
href="#chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key1">Technique 1</a>), then you may
consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order to perform an
accessibility check in one of those formats, as described below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of your document or template
(see <a href="#chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key1">Technique 1</a>), one
option is to save it into HTML format and use one of the web
accessibility checkers available online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Acrobat Professional</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://commonlook.com/accessibility-software/pdf-validator"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CommonLook PDF
Evaluator</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://www.access-for-all.ch/en/pdf-lab/pdf-accessibility-checker-pac.html"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF Accessibility Checker
(PAC)</a> – a free alternative provided by “Access for all”</li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full
Check…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Full Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking
option</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Start Checking</strong> button</li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">

using Adobe Acrobat Professional</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><span id="chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key12"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p>In some cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure
accessibility information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats
other than the default.</p>
<h4>To export to a different format</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Share &gt; Export</strong></li>
<li>Select the file format you would like to export</li>
<li>Customize the settings relevant to the selected file format</li>
<li>Click <strong>Next</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Save As</strong> box, enter a descriptive file
name</li>
<li>In the <strong>Where</strong> drop-down menu, specify the location
you would like the exported file to be saved</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see Technique 11 (above).</p>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;
tags</li>
<li>Check for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-021-keynote.xhtml_key11">Technique 11</a>) <em>Note:</em>
you may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help with this
process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (December 2019), OpenOffice Impress provides a
set of accessibility features that is sufficient to enable the
production of accessible digital office documents. However, OpenOffice
Impress does not include an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<h3>What’s an “Office Document”?</h3>
<p>You should use these techniques when you are using Impress to create
documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e., not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity)<strong>,</strong></li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or other
dynamic and/or interactive content, these techniques will still be
useful to you, but you should also consult the</strong> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</strong></a> <strong>because these are
specifically designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or
interactive content.</strong></p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Impress is <strong>ODF Presentation
(ODP)</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, Impress offers many other presentation processor and web
format saving options. Most of these have not been checked for
accessibility, but some information and/or instructions are available
for the following formats in <a
href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech12">Technique
12</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>MS PowerPoint (PPT and PPTX)</li>
<li>PDF</li>
<li>HTML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<p><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of
your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is required,
it is recommended that you test the office documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<p>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using OpenOffice Impress (ver. 3.2.1, Windows XP, Aug. 2010 and
Apache OpenOffice 4.1.7)) while creating an ODT document. Files can also
be easily saved as other file formats (see <a
href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech12">Technique
12</a>).</p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p><span id="chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech1"></span>All
office documents start with a template, which can be as simple as a
blank standard-sized page or as complex as a nearly complete document
with text, graphics and other content. For example, a “Meeting Minutes”
template might include headings for information relevant to a business
meeting, such as “Actions” above a table with rows to denote time and
columns for actions of the meeting.</p>
<p>Because templates provide the starting-point for so many documents,
accessibility is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is
accessible, you should check a sample document produced when the
template is used (see <a
href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech11">Technique
11</a>).</p>
<p>OpenOffice Impress’s default template for new documents is a blank
presentation. The basic installation also includes blank business card
and blank label templates. These are all accessible by virtue of being
blank. As well, you may create your own templates.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the techniques in this document</li>
<li>When you are finished you should also check the accessibility of the
document (see <a
href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech11">Technique
11</a>)</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties</strong></li>
<li>Use the <strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> to
indicate the accessibility status of the template. Using
<strong>Title</strong> (e.g., “Accessible Memo Template”) will increase
the prominence of the accessibility status because this is used in place
of the template’s file name. <strong>Comments</strong> can be used to
add more information if necessary (e.g., “This memo template has been
checked for accessibility.”).</li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong><strong>OK<br />
</strong></strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOImpress1.png" width="529"
height="390"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Title box and Comments box in Properties dialog." /></li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Templates &gt; Save</strong>
(Shift+F11)</li>
<li>In the <strong>New Template</strong> box, type a name for the
template</li>
<li>Select the category you would like to save it in, under
<strong>Categories<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> the category is simply the folder into which you
are saving the template</li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong><strong>OK<br />
</strong></strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOImpress2.png" width="552"
height="233"
alt="Image demonstrates location of New template name box and Categories list in Templates dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To select an accessible template</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> Only use these steps if you have an accessible
template available (e.g., that you previously saved). Otherwise, simply
open a new (blank) document.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Templates and
Documents</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Templates</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select a template document from the list<br />
<em>Note:</em> A properties pane appears on the right side of the
window, where you can read the document properties (Title, By, Date,
Modified by, Modified on, Description, and Size). If you placed
information about the accessibility of the template in the
<strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Comments</strong> when you created
the template (see above), this will be displayed in the
<strong>Title</strong> and/or <strong>Description</strong>,
respectively.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Open<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOImpress3.png" width="630" height="433"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Templates icon, Title and Description sections in My Templates dialog." /></li>
<li>A new document based on the template will be displayed. If you have
chosen an accessible template, the document will be accessible at this
point. <strong>As you add your content</strong> (e.g., text, images,
etc.)<strong>, ensure that you consult the sections that follow to
preserve accessibility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 2. Set Document Language</h2>
<p>In order for assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able
to present your document accurately, it is important to indicate the
natural language of the document. If a different natural language is
used for a paragraph or selected text, this also needs to be clearly
indicated.</p>
<h4>To select a language for the whole document</h4>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools &gt; Options</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Language Settings &gt; Languages</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Default languages for documents</strong>, select the
document language for all newly created documents<br />
<em>Note:</em> If you mark <strong>For the current document
only</strong>, your choice will only apply to the current document.</li>
<li>Close the dialog with <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOImpress4.png" width="735" height="384"
alt="Image demonstrates location of language option in Languages dialog." /></p>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text to which you want to apply a language</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Character</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Language</strong> and click <strong>OK<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/OOImpress5.png" width="532" height="391"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Font tab and Language option in Character dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 3. Use Built-In Layout and Styling Features</h2>
<h3><span id="chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech31"></span>3.1
Use Built-In Slide Layouts</h3>
<p>Instead of creating each slide in your presentation by starting from
a blank slide, check whether there is a suitable built-in layout.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The built-in layouts can be more accessible to users
of assistive technologies because they technologies sometimes read the
floating items on the slide in the order that they were placed on the
slide. The built-in layouts have usually taken this into account (e.g.,
“Title” first followed by other items, left to right and from top to
bottom). If you create slide layouts from scratch, it is sometimes
difficult to keep track of the order elements were placed.</p>
<h4>To apply “true layout” to a slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the slide in the <strong>Slides</strong> pane on the
left</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Slide Layout…</strong></li>
<li>Go to <strong>Tasks</strong> pane on the right</li>
<li>Select layout under the <strong>Layouts</strong> section<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOImpress6.png" width="206" height="462"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Layouts section in Tasks pane." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>3.2 Use Quick Styles</h3>
<p>You should make use of the quick styles that are included with the
office application (e.g., pre-defined heading fonts and characters)
before creating your own styles or using the character formatting tools
directly. Quick styles help your readers understand why something was
formatted in a given way, which is especially helpful when there are
multiple reasons for the same formatting (e.g., it is common to use
italics for emphasis, Latin terms and species names).</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While office application suites support headings in
much the same way, the named styles often differ.</p>
<p>Impress provides quick styles for theme fonts, but applying these
directly to text does not define the text as a heading or body font. To
define the font for headings and body text, you need to apply these
characteristics to the presentation theme.</p>
<p>Impress provides named styles for “Heading”, “Title”, etc., but not
for strong and emphasis.</p>
<h4>To use default named styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting</strong>
(F11)</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Graphic Styles</strong> icon</li>
<li>Select the named style</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Bucket</strong> icon in the element to which you
would like to apply the named style</li>
<li>Close the <strong>Styles and Formatting</strong> dialog<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOImpress7.png" width="240" height="373"

</ol>
<h4>To change the text size for a default named style</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Styles and Formatting</strong>
(F11)</li>
<li>Select the style to modify from the list</li>
<li>Right click and select: <strong>Modify…</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Font</strong> tab</li>
<li>Select a font size under <strong>Size</strong></li>
<li>Exit with <strong>OK<br />

</ol>
<h3>3.3 Customize Using Master Slides</h3>
<p>If a layout must be customized, it is recommended that Master Slides
be used.</p>
<p>Every slide layout in a presentation is defined by its master slide.
A master slide determines the formatting style for various elements of
the slide layout. This includes font styles, character formatting, and
the positioning of elements. Essentially, each master slide acts as a
design template for the slide layout.</p>
<p>If you edit any aspect of the slide layout in the master slide, the
change will affect all slides that were created based on it. For this
reason, it is good practice to edit the master slide and use the slide
layouts before building individual slides. It is essential that you
create and use master slides that meet the accessibility requirements
outlined in this document.</p>
<h4>To modify a Master Slide</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Master &gt; Slide
Master</strong></li>
<li>Edit the master slide, ensuring it aligns with the guidelines in
this document</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 4. Set a Logical Tab Order</h2>
<p><span id="chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech4"></span>Many
presentation applications create content composed almost exclusively of
“floating” objects. This means that they avoid the transitions between
in-line content and secondary “floating” objects (text boxes, images,
etc.) that can cause accessibility issues in word processors.</p>
<p>However, when you are working with “floating” objects, it is
important to remember that the way objects are positioned in two
dimensions on the screen may be completely different from how the
objects will be read by a screen reader or navigated using a keyboard.
The order that content is navigated sequentially is called the “Tab
Order” because often the “Tab” key is used to navigate from one
“floating” object to the next.</p>
<div>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for setting a logical “tab order” for “floating” objects</h4>
<ul>
<li>The tab order of floating objects is usually from the “lowest”
object on the slide to the “highest”.</li>
<li>Because objects automatically appear “on top” when they are
inserted, the default tab order is from the first object inserted to the
last. However, this will change if you use features such as “bring to
front” and “send to back”.</li>
<li>The slide’s main heading should be first in the tab order.</li>
<li>Headings should be placed in the tab order immediately before the
items (text, diagrams, etc.) for which they are acting as a
heading.</li>
<li>Labels should be in the reading order placed immediately before the
objects that they label.</li>
<li>For simple slide layouts, it may be possible to simply insert
objects in a logical tab order.</li>
<li>For more complex layouts, it may be easier to simply to create the
slide as usual and then set the tab order (see below).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<p><span
style="font-family: &#39;Cormorant Garamond&#39;, serif;font-size: 1.42425em;font-style: italic">To
set the tab order</span></p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the object</li>
<li>Select <strong>Arrange &gt; Bring to Front</strong>, <strong>Bring
Forward</strong>, <strong>Send Backward</strong>, or <strong>Send to
Back</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 5. Use Slide Notes</h2>
<p>A useful aspect of presentation applications is the facility to add
notes to slides, which can then be read by assistive technologies. You
can use these slide notes to explain and expand on the contents of your
slides in text format. Slide notes can be created as you build your
presentation.</p>
<h4>To add notes to your slides</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Notes Page</strong></li>
<li>In the text box positioned at the bottom of the page, select
<strong>Click to add notes</strong></li>
<li>Enter notes to accompany the slide</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Provide Text Alternatives for Images and Graphical
Objects</h2>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as charts and
graphs, it is important to ensure that the information you intend to
convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see the image.
This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text to of each
image. If an image is too complicated to concisely describe in the
alternative text alone (artwork, flowcharts, etc.), provide a short text
alternative and a longer description as well.</p>
<div>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<div class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, you do not have to provide
alternate text within the image.</p>
</div>

</ol>
<h2>Technique 7. Use Built-In Structuring Features</h2>
<h3>7.1 Tables</h3>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (e.g., screen
readers) to provide context so that the information within the table can
be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<div>
<div class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and quantity”).</li>
<li>Table cells should be marked as table headers when they serve as
labels to help interpret the other cells in the table.</li>
<li>Table header cells labels should be concise and clear.</li>
<li>Ensure the table is not “floating” on the page (see <a
href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech4">Technique
4</a>).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>To add a table with headings</h4>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Table…</strong></li>
<li>Specify the number of columns and rows in the new table<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOImpress11.png" width="359" height="140"
alt="Image demonstrates location of column number and row number options in the Insert Table dialog." /></li>
<li>Double-click anywhere within the table to open the
<strong>Table</strong> menu</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Table Design</strong> icon to open the
<strong>Table Design</strong> menu in the <strong>Tasks</strong> window
pane on the right<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/OOImpress12.png" width="353" height="77"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Table Design icoon in the Table menu." /></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Header row</strong> check box</li>
</ol>
<h3>7.2 Lists</h3>
<p>When you create lists, it is important to format them as “real
lists”. Otherwise, assistive technologies will interpret your list as a
series of short separate paragraphs instead of a coherent list of
related items.</p>
<h4>To create an ordered or unordered list</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Bullets and
Numbering</strong></li>
<li>For unordered lists, select an option from the
<strong>Bullets</strong> tab</li>
<li>For ordered lists, select an option from the <strong>Numbering
Type</strong> tab</li>
</ol>
<h4>To modify list styles</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Bullets and
Numbering</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Bullets and Numbering</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Customize</strong> tab</li>
<li>Modify the list style by making selections from the available
formatting options</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> This only modifies that instance of the list
style.</li>
</ol>
<h3>7.3 Columns</h3>
<p>Use Columns feature for placing text in columns.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Because columns can be a challenge for users of some
assistive technologies, consider whether a column layout is really
necessary.</p>
<h3>7.4 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Description</strong> tab</li>
<li>Type the new title in the <strong>Title</strong> box and click
<strong>OK<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em><span
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em">The
</span><strong>Title</strong><span
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em">defined in the properties is
different than the file name. It is also unrelated to the template name,
discussed above.</span></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Create Accessible Charts</h2>
<p>Charts can be used to make data more understandable for some
audiences. However, it is important to ensure that your chart is as
accessible as possible to all members of your audience. All basic
accessibility considerations that are applied to the rest of your
document must also be applied to your charts and the elements within
your charts. For example, use shape and color, rather than color alone,
to convey information. As well, some further steps should be taken to
ensure that the contents are your chart are appropriate labeled to give
users reference points that will help them to correctly interpret the
information.</p>
<h4>To create a chart</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select a slide layout with a placeholder for data charts (see <a
href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech31">Technique
3.1</a>)</li>
<li>Double-click* the center of the placeholder to insert the data
chart</li>
<li>Right-click* the chart and select <strong>Chart Data
Table…</strong></li>
<li>Update the data table with the data you would like to display</li>
<li>Close the data table</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add titles and labels</h4>
<ol>
<li>Double-click* the chart to access the chart menus</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Titles</strong></li>
<li>Update the relevant fields and select <strong>OK</strong></li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Insert &gt; Data Labels</strong></li>
<li>Configure your data label selections and select
<strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To change to a different predefined Chart Type</h4>
<ol>
<li>Double-click* the chart to access the chart menus</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Format &gt; Chart Type</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Chart Type</strong> dialog, select a predefined chart
type and style</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>Other Chart Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>When creating line charts, use the formatting options to create
different types of dotted lines to facilitate legibility for users who
are color blind</li>
<li>When creating bar charts, it is helpful to apply textures instead of
color to differentiate the bars</li>
<li>Change the default colors to a color safe or gray-scale palette</li>
<li>Use the formatting options to change predefined colors, ensuring
that they align with sufficient contrast requirements (see <a
href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech92">Technique
9.2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to be
printed, try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 18 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Office applications do
typically include accessibility features such as the ability to magnify
documents and support for high contrast modes. However, because printing
is an important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes
directly will change documents details such the pagination, the layout
of tables, etc., it is best practice to always format text for a
reasonable degree of accessibility.</p>
<h3><span id="chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech92"></span>9.2
Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juicy Studio: Luminosity Color
Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>

Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joe Dolson Color Contrast
Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search: gray-scale
conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use PowerPoint’s “Track Changes”
feature to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g. “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted, above.</p>
<h3>9.6 Avoid Transitions</h3>
<p>Transitions between slides and elements in each slide (e.g., bullets
in a list flying onto the screen) can be distracting to users with
disabilities. It can also cause assistive technologies to read the slide
incorrectly. For these reasons, it is best to avoid transitions
altogether.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>10.1 Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>10.2 Provide Context for Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>Hyperlink text in your document should be meaningful when read out of
context. To be an effective navigation aid, the link text should
describe the destination of the link.</p>
<p>Consider the experience of screen reader users: Generally, screen
readers generate a list of links, and screen reader users navigate this
list alphabetically. Hyperlink text such as “click here” or “more” is
meaningless in this context.</p>
<p>In order to be useful to someone using a screen reader, ensure that
hyperlink text is self-describing and meaningful on its own. To make the
address of hyperlink clear when printing, you may wish to include the
address in brackets following the descriptive text of the hyperlink.</p>
<h4>To change link text</h4>
<ol>
<li>Type the link address and <strong>Enter</strong></li>
<li>Highlight the link</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Edit &gt; Hyperlink…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Hyperlink</strong> dialog, type meaningful
descriptive text of the hyperlink in the field labeled
<strong>Text</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Apply</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Close</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>10.3 Accessible Presentations</h3>
<p>It is important to consider accessibility before, during, and after
presentations. Below is a helpful link with guidance on how to make
presentations accessible to all:</p>
<ul>
<li>“How to Make Presentations Accessible to All” (<a

</ul>
<h2>Technique 11. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p><span id="chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech11"></span>At this
time (December 2019), OpenOffice Impress does not offer a mechanism to
identify potential accessibility errors in your document prior to
publishing.</p>
<p>In order to get some indication of the accessibility of your document
or template (see <a
href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech1">Technique 1</a>),
then you may consider saving the file into HTML or PDF in order to
perform an accessibility check in one of those formats, as described
below.</p>
<h4>To evaluate HTML accessibility</h4>
<p>If you wish to check the accessibility of your document or template
(see <a href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech1">Technique
1</a>), one option is to save it into HTML format and use one of the web
accessibility checkers available online. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://achecker.ca/checker/index.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">AChecker</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation
Tool</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility</h4>
<p>If you saved your document in tagged PDF format, you can use the
following tools and steps to evaluate the accessibility of the PDF
document:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe Acrobat Professional</a></li>
<li><a

<h2>Technique 12. Use Accessibility Features when Saving/Exporting to
Other Formats</h2>
<p><span id="chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech12"></span>In some
cases, additional steps must be taken in order to ensure accessibility
information is preserved when saving/exporting to formats other than the
default.</p>
<h3>PDF</h3>
<p>PDF documents are not always accessible. Accessible PDF documents are
often called “Tagged PDF” because they include “tags” that encode
structural information required for accessibility. To evaluate the
accessibility of your PDF document, see <a
href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech11">Technique
11</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li><strong>Go to menu item: File &gt; Export as PDF</strong></li>
<li><strong>Check box labeled Tagged PDF</strong></li>
<li><strong>Click Export</strong></li>
<li>Enter name and save location</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> You must ensure this option is selected in the PDF
Options window dialog box before using PDF icon on menu bar.</p>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open the presentation that you want to save in HTML format.</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt;</strong>
<strong>Export</strong></li>
<li>Set the <strong>File type</strong> to <strong>HTML</strong>
<strong>Document (OpenOffice.org Impress) (.html;.htm)</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter a <strong>File name</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong></li>
<li>Follow the instructions in the <strong>HTML Export</strong>
Wizard</li>
<li>Check the HTML file for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech11">Technique 11</a>
)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To clean up your HTML file</h4>
<ul>
<li>Remove unnecessary styles, line breaks, etc.</li>
<li>Remove unnecessary id, class, and attributes</li>
<li>Remove font tags</li>
<li>Remove styles in the &lt;head&gt; tag</li>
<li>Ensure the &lt;th&gt; tags have a scope attribute</li>
<li>Remove &lt;p&gt; tags nested inside &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;
tags</li>
<li>Check for accessibility (see <a
href="#chapter-022-openoffice-impress.xhtml_tech11">Technique 11</a>
)<br />
<em>Note:</em> you may wish to use HTML editors or utilities to help
with this process.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing, Adobe InDesign CS6 (April 2013) and Adobe
InDesign Creative Cloud  2019 (December 2019) provide a set of
accessibility features that are sufficient to enable the production of
accessible digital documents.</p>
<h3>What is “InDesign”?</h3>
<p>You should use the technique below when you are using InDesign to
create documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intended to be used by people <em>(i.e., not computer
code</em>),</li>
<li>Text and Image based (<em>intended for design</em>)</li>
<li>Fully printable and can be digitized</li>
<li>Creative design (<em>layout, e.g., books, packages, poster,
interactive web</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: InDesign is best for print design, but there are also options
of doing web and digital publishing. If you are creating forms, web
pages, applications, or other dynamic and/or interactive content, the
techniques below will be useful, but consult the W3C-WAI Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) because these are specifically
designed to provide guidance for highly dynamic and/or interactive
content.</p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for InDesign is <strong>(.indd)</strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, InDesign offers many other web format saving options.
Most of these have not been checked for accessibility.</p>
<ul>
<li>ePub</li>
<li>PDF (print and interactive)</li>
<li>Flash Player SWF (for interactive)</li>
<li>HTML, XHTML</li>
<li>XML</li>
</ul>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to formulate these techniques so that they are useful
to all authors, regardless if they use a mouse. However, there are
several instances where mouse-only language is used for clarity purposes
. Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>*Right-click: To right-click with the keyboard, select the object
using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1) the “Right-Click”
key (<em>some keyboard have this to the right of the spacebar</em>) or
Shift+F10.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h4>
<p>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility of your
documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any specific
disability groups. In cases where more certainty is required, it is
recommended that you test the documents with end users with
disabilities, including screen reader users.</p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Templates</h2>
<p>InDesign starts with a simple blank page that can be adjusted to any
size. There are no build-in templates for InDesign. However, you can
create your own templates from scratch or download already made
templates from Adobe.</p>
<p>Templates provide the starting point for documents, so accessibility
is critical. If you are unsure whether a template is accessible, check
the document using Acrobat Pro. Export the file and use the
Accessibility Checker in Acrobat Pro.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible template</h4>
<ul>
<li>Select <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>New</strong> &gt;
<strong>New Document</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox">
Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + N (<em>on Windows</em>) and Cmd + N (<em>on
Mac</em>)
</div>
<ol>
<li>Select <em>print, web,</em> or <em>mobile</em> and <strong>Page
Size</strong></li>
<li><strong>Uncheck</strong> the <strong>Facing Pages box</strong> if
your document is <strong>NOT</strong> intended to be in <strong>book
format</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/New.jpg" class="alignnone"
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em" width="604" height="543"
alt="Image demonstrates the changes that should occur within the new document dialog box." /></li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> Adobe InDesign CC users will see a
different version of the dialog box with the same menu items.</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/indd19-new-doc-1024x611.png"
class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1986" width="1024" height="611"
alt="Image demonstrates the changes that should occur within the new document dialog box." /></p>
</div>
</div>
<h4>To Saving File as a Template</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Select file</strong> &gt; <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox">
Keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + S (<em>on Windows</em>) and Cmd + S (<em>on
Mac</em>)
</div>
<ol>
<li>Insert file name and under <strong>Save as type</strong> select
<strong>CS6 InDesign template</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong><strong>Save</strong></strong></li>
</ol>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> InDesign CC, users will see the
following dialog box.</p>
<p><strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/indd19-save-as-template.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1987" width="840" height="469"
alt="Image demonstrates where the “save type” is located in the “save as” dialog box." /></strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<p> </p>
<h2>Technique 2. Specify Document Language</h2>
<p>The language setting in InDesign will set language within the program
only. This language setting in InDesign will not carry over to the
exported PDF. Be sure to set the document language in Adobe Acrobat
after exporting to PDF.</p>
<h4>To specify the document language for an exported PDF</h4>
<ol>
<li>Choose <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
<li>Specify a name and location for the file. For Compatibility, choose
the lowest PDF version necessary to open the files you create.</li>
<li>For <strong>Save As</strong><em>Type</em> (Windows) or
<em>Format</em> (Mac OS), choose <strong>Adobe PDF (Print)</strong>, and
then click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
<li>Find the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and go to
<strong>Accessibility Options.</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Language</strong>, choose the document language for
the PDF. This determines the default language for the exported
PDF.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/inddCC-language.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1988" width="670" height="664"
alt="Image demonstrates the Accessibility Options under the Advanced settings section of the Export Adobe PDF dialog box." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 3. Creating Artifacts for Objects</h2>
<p>The <strong>artifact</strong> tag allows users to hide items on the
page, such as page numbers or unimportant objects, when viewing the
exported PDF file in Reflow view, which displays only tagged items. This
is also useful when viewing PDF files on a mobile device or in other PDF
readers.</p>
<p>There are two options to creating artifacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1 uses Object Export Options Dialog box where the user select
the images in the document individually and add artifact.</li>
<li>Option 2 uses Tag pane where the users individually select the
object and add the required tagging.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span
id="chapter-023-adobe-indesign.xhtml_indd-alt-text"></span>Artifact
Option 1</h3>
<ol>
<li>Select the image or object</li>
<li>Select <strong>Object</strong> &gt; <strong>Object Export
Options</strong> <img src="OEBPS/assets/ALT-cs6.jpg" width="578"
height="510"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of “Object Export Options” dialog box." /></li>
<li>Select <strong>Tagged PDF</strong> &gt; <strong>Apply
Tag</strong></li>
<li>Choose either <strong>Artifact</strong> or <strong>Based on
Object</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Done<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/ALT2.jpg" width="581" height="389"
alt="Image demonstrates the changes that should occur under &quot;Tagged PDF&quot; in the &quot;Object Export Options&quot; box." /></li>
</ol>
<h3>Artifact Option 2</h3>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li>Select the object or artifact</li>
<li>In <strong>Tag pane</strong> select <strong>Artifact<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> to view Tags Panel: (<strong>Window</strong>
&gt; <strong>Utilities</strong> &gt; <strong>Tags</strong>)<br />

<h2>Technique 4. Alternative Text for Images and Graphical Objects</h2>
<p>When using images or other graphical objects, such as graphs, shapes,
and background, it is important to ensure that the information you
intend to convey using the image is also conveyed to people who cannot
see the image. This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative
text to each image.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for Writing Alternative Text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank and create an artifact (e.g., background images
should generally have no alt text, other decorative images should only
have alt text if they form a crucial part of the content, message, and
purpose of the document).</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated.</li>
<li>For logos, the alternative text should be the organization’s
name.</li>
<li>For groups of logos, one logo can be chosen to represent the
group.</li>
<li>Sometimes text is included as part of a logo or footer image (e.g.
the image might contain a phone number), this text should be set as the
alternative text of the image.</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences.</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (<em>see
above</em>) are insufficient to answer the question “what information is
the image conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (<em>e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.</em>). In
these cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your
own assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<p>There are two options to add Alternative Text to images Option one
uses the <strong>Object Export Options</strong> dialog box where the
user select the images in the document individually and add the
alternative text. Option two uses Structure panel that create attribute
to individual images.</p>
<p>When you export the document, the alt text you’ve assigned will
travel with the image.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the image or object</li>
<li>Select <strong>Object</strong> &gt; <strong>Object Export
Options</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add alternative text to images (Option 1)</h4>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li>Select <strong>Alt Text</strong> &gt; <strong>Alt Text
Source</strong> drop down menu</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Custom<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/ALT1.jpg" width="573" height="384"
alt="Image demonstrates the changes that should occur under &quot;Alt Text&quot; in the &quot;Object Export Options&quot; box." /></li>
<li>Type the description in the box below</li>
<li>Select <strong>Done</strong></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add alternative text to images (Option 2 – Using Structure
Panel)</h4>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li><strong>Structure Panel</strong> (<strong>View</strong> &gt;
<strong>Structure</strong> &gt; <strong>Show Structure</strong>)</li>
<li>Select the Figure in the panel.</li>
<li>Select <img src="OEBPS/assets/3LINEbutton.jpg" width="25"
height="17" alt="Image of a button." />  or <img
src="OEBPS/assets/Screen-Shot-2019-11-26-at-3.57.51-PM.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1989" width="22" height="19"
alt="Image of a button with three stripes." /></li>
<li>Select <strong>New Attribute<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/ALT3.jpg" width="508" height="199"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of “New Attribute” dialog box." /></li>
<li>Insert <strong>Alt</strong> (case sensitive) under
<strong>Name</strong> (Note: You <em>must use a capital “A” and
lowercase “lt” to be valid</em>)</li>
<li>Place the descriptions under <strong>Value<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/ALT4.jpg"
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em" width="496" height="223"
alt="Image demonstrates the changes that should occur within the “New Attribute” dialog box." /></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p><span id="chapter-023-adobe-indesign.xhtml_cs5"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 5. Creating Paragraph Styles</h2>
<p>Any document that is longer than a few paragraphs require structure
to make them more straightforward for readers to understand. Creating
Paragraph styles will set the headings and style for the document. It
will also help in creating a Table of Contents. The structural elements
that indicate order and level provide a meaningful sequence to users of
assistive technologies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select <strong>Paragraph Styles</strong> (<em>in typography
workspace</em>)</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox">
Keyboard shortcut: F11 (<em>on Windows</em>) Cmd + F11 (<em>on Mac</em>)
</div>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li>Select <img src="OEBPS/assets/3LINEbutton.jpg" width="25"
height="17" alt="Image of a button." /> or <img
src="OEBPS/assets/Screen-Shot-2019-11-26-at-3.57.51-PM.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1989" width="22" height="19"
alt="Image of a button with three stripes." /> in the top right corner
for more options.</li>
<li>Select <strong>New Paragraph Style…</strong> <img
src="OEBPS/assets/Style.jpg" style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"
width="662" height="526"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of “new paragraph style” dialog box." /></li>
<li>Select <strong>General</strong> &gt; <strong>Style Name</strong> and
insert a title for the style (<em>e.g., header, body text, caption
.etc</em>)<img src="OEBPS/assets/Style1_0.jpg"
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em" width="657" height="538"
alt="Image demonstrates the change that should occur in the paragraph style dialog box." /></li>
<li>Select <strong>Basic Character Formats</strong> located in the left
side pane</li>
<li>Choose the font, font style and the size</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 6. Creating Accessible Tables</h2>
<p>When using tables, it is important to ensure that they are clear and
appropriately structured. This helps all users to better understand the
information in the table and allows assistive technologies (<em>e.g.,
screen readers</em>) to provide context so that the information within
the table can be conveyed in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>When creating accessible tables in InDesign, there are some things to
keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to add alternative text to facilitate understanding of the
table (see <a
href="#chapter-023-adobe-indesign.xhtml_indd-alt-text">Technique
3</a>).</li>
<li>After converting your InDesign document to PDF, be sure to review
the document in Adobe Acrobat and ensure that the table is properly
tagged.</li>
</ul>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for tables</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only use tables for tabular information, not for formatting, such as
to position columns.</li>
<li>Use “real tables” rather than text formatted to look like tables
using the TAB key or space bar. These will not be recognized by
assistive technology.</li>
<li>Keep tables simple by avoiding merged cells and dividing complex
data sets into separate smaller tables, where possible.</li>
<li>If tables split across pages, set the header to show at the top of
each page. Also set the table to break between rows instead of in the
middle of rows.</li>
<li>Create a text summary of the essential table contents. Any
abbreviations used should be explained in the summary.</li>
<li>Table captions or descriptions should answer the question “what is
the table’s purpose and how is it organized?” (<em>e.g., “A sample order
form with separate columns for the item name, price and
quantity”</em>).</li>
<li>Table header cell labels should be concise and clear.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To create tables</h4>
<div class="textbox">
Keyboard short cut: Ctrl + Alt + Shift + T <em>(on Windows)</em>, Cmd +
Shift + Option + T <em>(on Mac)</em>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Create a table, go to <strong>Table</strong> &gt; <strong>Create
Table</strong></li>
<li>Insert <strong>Body Rows</strong><span
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em">and
</span><strong>Columns<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/Table-1.jpg"
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em" width="438" height="271"
alt="Image show &quot;Insert Table&quot; dialog box." /></li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To convert Text (with tabs) to a Table</h4>
<p>If you have created text with tabs. To convert the text to a
table:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select all the text</li>
<li><strong>Table</strong> &gt; <strong>Convert To Table</strong></li>
<li><strong>Column Separator</strong> &gt; <strong>Tab</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/texttotable.jpg"
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em" width="506" height="222"
alt="Image show &quot;convert text to table&quot; dialog box." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>Removing Table Lines</h4>
<ol>
<li>Place the Type cursor on top of the table until the cursor changes
to an upside down black arrow.</li>
<li>Click and drag the cursor to select all of the chart (<em>or part of
the chart</em>)</li>
<li>In the top navigation. It’ll show a line box where you can choose
which side you would like to remove the line from.</li>
<li>Once selected. Click on the “<strong>None</strong>” outline
button<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Table_0.jpg"
style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em" width="246" height="296"
alt="Image locate how to removed line from table." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>Repeat table header</h4>
<p>If you have a table that spans more than one page or spread, it’s
important to ensure that table headers are repeated to facilitate
understanding of the content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Table</strong> &gt; <strong>Table Options</strong>
&gt; <strong>Table Setup…</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Table Options</strong> dialog box appears.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>TableSetup</strong> tab, indicate the number
of <strong>Header Rows</strong>, under Table Dimensions.</li>
<li> Next, go to the <strong>Headers and Footers</strong> tab.  Here you
can indicate if you would like your table header repeated on every page,
column, or frame.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/indd-table-headers.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1993" width="611" height="559"
alt="Image demonstrates the Table Options dialog box, with the Repeat Header options are displayed." /></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-023-adobe-indesign.xhtml_cs7"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 7. Tagging Items</h2>
<p>Tagging items will help assistive technologies (<em>e.g., screen
readers</em>) to locate the logical order of the assigned headings.
Also, when exporting the document to a PDF, the tagging will
automatically be embedded, therefore, the user does not need to apply
tagging in Acrobat.</p>
<h4>To quickly tag the items in the file</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> This does not tag all content correctly. To correctly
tag all content, you would have to assign the tags manually (see <a
href="#chapter-023-adobe-indesign.xhtml_tagmanual">To Assign Tags
Manually</a>).</p>
<ol>
<li>Structure Panel (<strong>View</strong> &gt;
<strong>Structure</strong> &gt; <strong>Show Structure</strong>)<br />
keyboard shortcut Alt + Ctrl + 1 (on Window), Cmd + Option + 1 (on
Mac)<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Structure.jpg"

style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em" width="672" height="539"
alt="Image demonstrates location of tag with in the paragraph style options dialog box." /><br />
<em>Note:</em> To make the reading order and tags easier to manage make
thread text boxes. If possible make one text box per page.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Creating Table of Contents</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a paragraph style (see <a

<h3>8.1 Columns</h3>
<p>Use Columns feature for placing text in columns instead of creating
multiple text boxes.</p>
<h3>8.2 Use Page Numbering</h3>
<p>Numbering the pages of your document helps those reading and editing
your document effectively navigate and reference its content. For users
of assistive technologies, it provides a valuable point of reference
within the document.</p>
<h3>8.3 Naming PDF before exporting</h3>

<em>Note:</em> You can also fill in the author’s name and
description.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 9. Make Content Easier to See</h2>
<p>Here are some other things to keep in mind:</p>
<h3>9.1 Format of Text</h3>
<p>When formatting text, especially when the text is likely to printed,
try to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use font sizes between 12 and 15 points for body text.</li>
<li>Use fonts of normal weight, rather than bold or light weight fonts.
If you do choose to use bold fonts for emphasis, use them
sparingly.</li>
<li>Use standard fonts with clear spacing and easily recognized upper
and lower case characters. Sans serif fonts (e.g., Arial, Verdana) may
sometimes be easier to read than serif fonts (e.g., Times New Roman,
Garamond).</li>
<li>Avoid large amounts of text set all in caps, italic or
underlined.</li>
<li>Use normal or expanded character spacing, rather than condensed
spacing.</li>
<li>Avoid animated or scrolling text.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>But can’t users just zoom in?</strong> Because printing is an
important aspect of many workflows and changing font sizes directly will
change documents details such the pagination, the layout of tables,
etc., it is best practice to always format text for a reasonable degree
of accessibility.</p>
<h3>9.2 Use Sufficient Contrast</h3>
<p>The visual presentation of text and images of text should have a
contrast ration of at least 4.5:1. To help you determine the contrast,
here are some examples on a white background:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very good contrast (Foreground=black, Background=white,
Ratio=21:1)</li>
<li>Acceptable contrast (Foreground=#767676, Background=white,
Ratio=4.54:1)</li>
<li>Unacceptable contrast (Foreground=#AAAAAA, Background=white,
Ratio=2.32:1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, always use a single solid color for a text background rather
than a pattern.</p>
<p>In order to determine whether the colors in your document have
sufficient contrast, you can consult an online contrast checker, such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebAIM: Contrast
Checker</a></li>
<li><a
href="http://juicystudio.com/services/luminositycontrastratio.php">Juicy
Studio: Luminosity Color Contrast Ratio Analyzer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-tester.php">Joe
Dolson Color Contrast Spectrum Tester</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.joedolson.com/color-contrast-compare.php">Joe
Dolson Color Contrast Comparison</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>9.3 Avoid Using Color Alone</h3>
<p>Color should not be used as the only visual means of conveying
information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element. In order to spot where color might be
the only visual means of conveying information, you can create a
screenshot of the document and then view it with online gray-scale
converting tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>GrayBit v2.0: Grayscale Conversion Contrast Accessibility Tool</li>
</ul>
<div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives">
<div class="textbox__content">
<p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> GrayBit v2.0 is no longer available.
However, multiple tools can be found online: <a
href="https://www.google.com/search?q=convert+image+to+grayscale+online">Google
Search: gray-scale conversion tool</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h3>9.4 Avoid Relying on Sensory Characteristics</h3>
<p>The instructions provided for understanding and operating content
should not rely solely on sensory characteristics such as the color or
shape of content elements. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not track changes by simply changing the color of text you have
edited and noting the color. Instead use <a
href="https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/indesign/using/tracking-reviewing-changes.html"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">InDesign’s “Track Changes”
feature</a> to track changes.</li>
<li>Do not distinguish between images by referring to their appearance
(e.g., “the bigger one”). Instead, label each image with a figure number
and use that for references.</li>
</ul>
<h3>9.5 Avoid Using Images of Text</h3>
<p>Before you use an image to control the presentation of text (e.g., to
ensure a certain font or color combination), consider whether you can
achieve the same result by styling “real text”. If this is not possible,
as with logos containing stylized text, make sure to provide alternative
text for the image following the techniques noted above.</p>
<h2>Technique 10. Make Content Easier to Understand</h2>
<h3>Write Clearly</h3>
<p>By taking the time to design your content in a consistent way, it
will be easier to access, navigate and interpret for all users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whenever possible, write clearly with short sentences.</li>
<li>Introduce acronyms and spell out abbreviations.</li>
<li>Avoid making the document too “busy” by using lots of whitespace and
by avoiding too many different colors, fonts and images.</li>
<li>If content is repeated on multiple pages within a document or within
a set of documents (e.g., headings, footings, etc.), it should occur
consistently each time it is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="chapter-023-adobe-indesign.xhtml_indd-checker"></span></p>
<h2>Accessibility Checker</h2>
<p>To check for accessibility, first, the InDesign file must be exported
to a PDF and viewed in Acrobat Pro.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Export</strong> (keyboard
shortcut: <em>Windows:</em> Ctrl + E; <em>Mac:</em> Cmd + E)</li>
<li><strong>Save as:</strong> PDF (Interactive or Print)</li>
<li>Select <strong>Save</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/Export.jpg"
width="618" height="544" alt="Image show “Export” dialog box." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To evaluate PDF accessibility in Adobe Acrobat Professional</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full
Check…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Full Check</strong> dialog, select all the checking
option</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Start Checking</strong> button</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (December 2019), Acrobat 11 Pro and Acrobat
Pro DC enables the production of accessible digital documents. Both
Acrobat 11 Pro and DC include an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While PDF accessibility has improved over the years,
accessibility support for PDF by authoring tools, viewers, and assistive
technologies (e.g., screen readers) is not as widespread as for HTML
documents.</p>
<p><strong>We recommend considering HTML instead of or in addition to
PDF where appropriate.</strong></p>
<h3>Should I use ADOD or WCAG 2.0?</h3>
<p>These techniques can help you to use Acrobat 11 Pro to create
documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e. not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e. not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e. where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity),</li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e. without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or
other dynamic and/or interactive content, these you should also consult
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C-WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG 2.0)</a>. The WCAG working group has provided <a
href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20-TECHS/pdf.html" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">PDF Techniques for WCAG 2.0</a>.</p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Acrobat 11 Pro and DC is <strong>Adobe
Portable Document Format (PDF)</strong>. In addition, Acrobat 11 Pro
offers several other word processor and web format saving options. These
have not been checked for accessibility.</p>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to write these techniques so that they are useful to
all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or (2) Shift+F10.</li>
<li><strong><span
id="chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_*drag"></span>*Drag:</strong>
Unfortunately, there is no keyboard alternative for several operations
in Acrobat 11 Pro that require dragging.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility
of your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any
specific disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is
required, it is recommended that you test the office documents with end
users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</li>
<li>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Adobe Acrobat 11 Pro (ver.11.0, Windows 7, April. 2013)
and Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (version 2019.021.20056, macOS Mojave version
10.14.6, December 2019).</li>
<li>Unfortunately, tasks completed in <a

5</a> cannot be undone. It is recommended that you save your PDF
document often under different names, especially before you make
significant changes.</li>
<li>This document is provided for information purposes only and is
neither a recommendation nor a guarantee of results</li>
</ul>
<p><span
id="chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_a11-1"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Source Documents</h2>
<p>In the Adobe Acrobat 11 Pro workflow, all PDF documents start with a
source document created in an office document authoring application,
such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org Writer. Because source
documents provide the starting-point for the PDF documents,
accessibility is very important.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible source document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document in the authoring application (from the default
blank template or from one of the pre-packaged templates).</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the <strong>ADOD Authoring
Techniques</strong> provided for the authoring application (an updated
version available at <a
href="https://pressbooks.library.ryerson.ca/docs" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer">Understanding Document
Accessibility</a>).</li>
<li>When you are finished, you should also check the accessibility of
the document (see “Accessibility Checking” in the Authoring Techniques
for the authoring application).</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have completed the above steps, you are ready to convert
your document to PDF using Adobe Acrobat 11 or Acrobat DC.</p>
<h4>To convert single source documents to PDF</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to the menu item: <strong>File &gt; Create &gt; PDF From
file…</strong></li>
<li>Locate and select your source document and select the
<strong>Open</strong> button, Acrobat will then proceed to convert the
file.</li>
</ol>
<p>A batch conversion process is also available from the menu item:
<strong>File &gt; Create PDF &gt; Batch Create Multiple
Files</strong>.</p>
<h3>Scanned Content</h3>
<p>If you created a PDF from a scanned document, then it will be
inherently inaccessible to screen readers and other assistive
technologies. The document will be less useful because graphic
representations of text cannot be selected, edited or searched.</p>
<p>In this case, it is necessary that you convert the scanned images of
text to searchable content using Acrobat’s <strong>optical character
recognition (OCR)</strong> feature before addressing the accessibility
features of the document.</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_a11-2"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 2. Check Accessibility</h2>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h3>“Make Accessible Action Wizard</h3>
<p>The “Make Accessible” Action Wizard can help you create accessible
PDFs by leading you through the techniques in this guide (e.g., setting
alternative text, setting document properties, etc.).</p>
<p><img src="OEBPS/assets/acrobat-make-accessible.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2041" width="276" height="458"
alt="Image demonstrates location of the &quot;make accessible&quot; option under the Action Wizard pane." /></p>
<p>You can complete the wizard in its entirety by pressing
<strong>Start</strong> or you can follow the the instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Add Document Description</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/acrobat-add-doc-desc.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2042" width="227" height="795"
alt="Image shows the &quot;Make Accessible&quot; panel if the users want to manually set accessibility settings." /></li>
<li>Fill in the <strong>Title</strong> (author, subject and keywords can
also be filled in). See also <a

<li>Select <strong>Set Open Options</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Set Tabs Order Property</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Set Reading Language</strong></li>
<li>In the drop down menu, select the language for the file). See also

alt="Image show a pop up language box where the user can set the language of the document." /></li>
<li>Select <strong>Add Tags to Document</strong><br />
<em>Note:</em> This will automatically add tags to the file.
Unfortunately, this process sometimes misinterprets the structure and
reading order of complex page elements. Therefore, you should still
manually check the tags (see <a
href="#chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_a11-3">Technique
3</a>).</li>
<li>Select <strong>Set Alternative Text</strong>. See also <a
href="#chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_a11-4">Technique
4</a>.<br />
The wizard automatically searches for” figures” in the file. You must
then fill in the alternate text in the pop up box.<br />
<em>Note:</em> The wizard might not tag all the images as figures, so
check if tags are correct.<img src="OEBPS/assets/alt.jpg" width="307"
height="201" alt="Image of alternative text pop up box." /></li>
<li>Select <strong>Run Accessibility Full Check</strong>. See also <a
href="#chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_a11-2">Technique
2</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Recognize Text using OCR</strong>.</li>

Documents in Adobe Acrobat</a> by the National Center on Disability and
Access to Education for a video walkthrough and handout on the “Make
Accessible” Wizard.</p>
</section>
<p>The most basic requirement for a PDF document to be accessible is for
it to be <strong>“tagged”</strong> with hidden labels (“tags”) that
describe the structure of the document (e.g. that text should be
interpreted as a header, paragraph, table cell, etc.). Screen readers
can use these tags to convey the document’s information effectively to
people with visual disabilities.</p>
<p>The other requirements for a PDF document to be accessible (e.g.
alternate text, logical reading order, etc.) can only all apply once the
document is tagged.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<em>Caution!:</em> The “Quick Check” feature is <strong>not
recommended</strong> because it misses some important accessibility
issues. Always perform a “Full Check” instead.
</div>
<h4>To perform a “Full Check”</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> If “Accessibility” is not visible under tools, go to
menu item: <strong>View &gt; Tools &gt; Accessibility</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full Check
Up<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/acrobat-full-check.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2035" width="274" height="506"
alt="Image locates the &quot;full check&quot; option in the Accessibility pane." /></li>
<li>Once the file is fully run through the checker, a panel will show
which parts of the files are correct and which parts need to be
fixed.<br />

class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2036" width="388" height="970"
alt="Image shows errors, warnings and correct accessible report in the &quot;accessibility checker&quot; panel." /></li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a large document, it may be more efficient to run a full
check one page or a page range at a time.</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_a11-3"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 3. Add and Edit Tags</h2>
<div class="textbox">
<p><em>Caution!:</em> Actions taken using the TouchUp Reading Order tool
and Order Panel cannot be undone and in some cases Acrobat may
misinterpret your intentions. Remember to save your work frequently! If
you frequently create PDF files you might consider using one of these <a
href="#chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_acc-support-tools">accessible
PDF support tools</a>.</p>
<p>If tags are missing, then they must be added. When tags are present,
they should still be checked for correctness and edited as needed.</p>
</div>
<h3><span
id="chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_tag-types"></span>Touch
Up Reading Order Tags</h3>
<p>The <strong>TouchUp Reading Order</strong> dialog box offers some
basic document tag options. Acrobat’s Help text describes the tags as
follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Text</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as text.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Figure</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a figure. <em>Text contained within a figure tag
is defined as part of the image and is not read by screen readers,
though alternate text defined for the figure is read out.Note:</em> An
effective way of handling very complex text constructs (e.g. flow
charts) is to group it all as a figure and then provide a unified alt
text description for the entire group.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Form Field</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a form field.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Figure/Caption</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags a selected figure and caption as a single tag. Any text contained
in the tag is defined as a caption. Useful for tagging photos and
captions and preventing caption text from being incorrectly added to
adjacent text blocks. <em>Note:</em> Unless the caption actually
describes the image, the figures will still require alternate text.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth
level heading tag. You can convert heading tags to bookmarks to help
users navigate the document.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Table</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a table. When this selection is made, Acrobat
analyzes the selection to determine the location of headings, columns,
and rows.<br />
<em>Note:</em> Table editing can be especially challenging. Try to keep
them as simple as possible in the source document.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Cell</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a table or header cell. Use this option to merge
cells that are incorrectly split.<br />
<em>Note:</em> Table editing can be especially challenging. Try to keep
them as simple as possible in the source document.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Formula</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a formula. <em>Note:</em> Because speech software
may handle formula tags differently from normal text, you should still
add alternate text.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Background</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a background element, or artifact, removing the
item from the tag tree so that it does not appear in the reflowed
document and is not read by screen readers.
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Additional Tags</h3>
<p>Not all tags are available using the TouchUp Reading order dialog
window. Additional tags can be accessed from the Tags pane. See the
<strong><a
href="#chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_edit-tags">Editing
tags using the Tags pane</a></strong> section for more information.</p>
<h4>Document Section Tags</h4>
<p>There are additional tags that help define semantic and structural
file elements in more detail. The Adobe Acrobat website categorizes and
defines all standard tags as follows (some appear in the section
above):</p>

<h4>Heading and Paragraph Elements</h4>
<p>Heading and paragraph elements are paragraph-like, block-level
elements that include specific level heading and generic paragraph (P)
tags. A heading (H) element should appear as the first child of any
higher-level division. Six levels of headings (H1 to H6) are available
for applications that don’t hierarchically nest sections (See TouchUp

elsewhere in the document.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>To add tags automatically</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> The automatic tagging feature may be sufficient on
simple layouts, but it sometimes misinterprets the structure and reading
order of complex page elements (e.g. closely spaced columns, irregular
text alignment, and tables without borders.). Therefore, use the
automatic tagging feature as a starting point, and always manually check
and edit the tags as explained below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools &gt; Accessibility &gt; Add Tags To
Document</strong><br />
*To Show the hidden “Accessibility” drop down menu Go to menu item:
<strong>View &gt; Tools &gt; Accessibility</strong><br />
<em>Note:</em> This command removes any tags that were in the document
before the command was run. If any potential problems were encountered,
an Add Tags Report appears in the navigation pane.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To add/edit tags manually</h4>
<p>There are two ways of adding and editing tags in Adobe Acrobat. You
can either do it through the TouchUp Reading Order dialog box, or using
the Tags navigation pane.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Some tag types are not available through the TouchUp
Reading Order dialog box. For documents with complex layouts and
elements, use it together with the Tags pane method described below.</p>
<h4>Adding/Editing tags using TouchUp Reading Order</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Tools &gt; Accessibility &gt; TouchUp
Reading Order…</strong><br />
In most cases, it will help to have the four checkboxes checked
(<strong>Show page content groups</strong>, <strong>Show table
cells</strong>, <strong>Display like elements in a single
block</strong>, <strong>Show tables and figures</strong>)</li>
<li>Using the <strong>TouchUp Reading Order</strong> tool, <a
href="#chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_drag">drag*</a>
within the document pane to select a region of the page that contains
one type of content (e.g. a text block)<br />
<em>Note:</em> If you drag* over part of an already tagged element, the
element is sometimes split up. This is helpful when splitting larger
elements to ensure correct reading over of sub-elements.</li>
<li>To add more page content to the current selection, <strong>Shift +
drag*</strong></li>
<li>To remove page content from the current selection, <strong>Ctrl +
drag*</strong></li>
<li>Select the appropriate button in the <strong>TouchUp Reading
Order</strong> dialog to specify the tag type, a box should now
encapsulate the element (<a
href="#chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_tag-types">the tags
are explained here</a>).<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/acrobat-reading-order.png"

alt="Image of touch up reading order dialog box" /></li>
</ol>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for Tagging</h4>
<ul>
<li>On the “Touch Up Reading Order” dialog, make sure to select the
<strong>Show page content groups</strong> checkbox and the
<strong>Structure types</strong> radio button. This will display the
type of structure for each tag, which will help you to spot mis-tagged
content.</li>
<li>A good place to start is tagging “Background” content, since this
will reduce the number of tags to deal with. Background content should
include:
<ul>
<li>empty boxes,</li>
<li>visible or invisible text box borders (especially in busy areas
where they overlap with text),</li>
<li>visuals that are decorative or redundant (e.g., backgrounds,
illustrations), whose content is described adequately in the text .</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you are having difficulty tagging complex content (e.g., a
complex table), consider either:
<ul>
<li>Editing the source document to simplify it, or</li>
<li>Selecting the complex content and tagging it as a figure for which
you must then add alternative text that properly conveys all of the
information in the new figure</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4><span
id="chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_edit-tags"></span>Editing
tags using the Tags pane</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Show/Hide &gt; Navigation Panes
&gt; Tags…</strong><br />
<em>Note:</em> For best results, use ‘Add Tags to Document’ first. You
can also create a new tag using the TouchUp Reading Order dialog box and
then edit it in the Tags Pane.</li>
<li>To change a tag, locate it in the structure tree.</li>
<li>Right-click* on the tag, and select <strong>Properties</strong>.
From the drop-down menu next to tag type, select the tag you would like
to use.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can edit tags by clicking on the tag name
drop-down menu, and then typing the appropriate tag name (see list of
tags above).<br />

<h2>Technique 4. Provide Alternative Text</h2>
<p>When using images, it is important to ensure that the information you
intend to convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see
the image. This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text
to each image. If the image is purely decorative, mark it as
background.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank (e.g. Background images should generally have no
alt text, other decorative images should only have alt text if they form
a crucial part of the content, message, and purpose of the
document)</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>For logos, the alternative text should be the organization’s
name</li>
<li>For groups of logos, one logo can be chosen to represent the
group</li>
<li>Sometimes text is included as part of a logo or footer image (e.g.
the image might contain a phone number), this text should be set as the
alternative text of the image</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g. for a chart or graph), provide
a short description in the alternative text (e.g. a summary of the
trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g. an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, the images should be marked as
“Background” and you do not have to provide alternate text within the
image.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text to images</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt;
<strong>Set Alternate Text<br />
</strong>(If “Accessibility” is not listed, it can be opened from menu
item: <strong>View &gt; Tools &gt; Accessibility</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Ok</strong> the Adobe Acrobat pop up box</li>
<li>Type in the description in the Set Alternative Text pop up box</li>
<li>Select the right arrow to set alternative text on the next
figure</li>
<li>When complete select <strong>Save &amp; Close</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The dialog box will automatically select all the objects that are
tags as figure.</p>
<h4>To add alternative text to links</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select the text or object for which you want to create a link.</li>
<li>Right-click* the selection, and choose Create Link from the context
menu.</li>
<li>In the Create Link dialog box, select the appropriate options, and
then follow the onscreen instructions to specify a URL, page view, or
file as the link target.</li>
</ol>
<p><span
id="chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_a11-5"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 5. Set a Logical Reading Order</h2>
<p>Setting up reading order will set up the way the device will read the
file out loud to view and change reading order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Order Pane</strong> (<strong>View</strong> &gt;
<strong>Show/Hide</strong> &gt; <strong>Navigation Panes</strong> &gt;
<strong>Order</strong>)<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/acrobat-order.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2044" width="727" height="528"
alt="Image locates “order” panel." /></li>
<li>Once the order pane is selected the file will show numbers per page
showing the reading order.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Reading_order1_0.jpg" width="671" height="449"
alt="Image shows wrong reading order that occurs in files." /></li>
<li>If the reading order is incorrect, select the following information
from the pane and move the information bellow or above to make the
reading order correct.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To test the reading order</h4>
<p>Sometimes it may not be clear by looking at content, what would be
the most logical aural reading order. In these cases, it is recommended
to preview the reading order.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<em>Caution!:</em> The “Read Out Loud” feature is <strong>not
recommended</strong> for checking the aural order because it will
provide inaccurate results.
</div>
<p>One method for testing the reading order of your document is called
“reflowing”, which temporarily presents it as a single column that is
the width of the document pane. Only readable text appears in the reflow
view.</p>
<p>If the tagged PDF does not reflow the way you want, it means that the
content order or reading order of the PDF contains inconsistencies. If
this is the case, in addition to correcting the reading order, it may
also be helpful to edit the document tags.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Zoom &gt; Reflow</strong></li>
<li>To return to regular view, go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Zoom
&gt; Reflow</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Another way to test the aural accessibility of a document is to
attempt to access the document with the screen readers that your readers
will use (e.g., NVDA or JAWS on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac OS).</p>
<p><span
id="chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_a11-6"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 6. Set Document Properties</h2>
<p>It is important to set up the PDF correctly in order for assistive
technologies (e.g., screen readers) to be able to present your document
accurately.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Properties<br />
</strong><em>keyboard shortcut:</em> Ctrl + D (on windows), Cmd + D (on
Mac)</li>
<li>Under <strong>Descriptions</strong> tab fill in the title and
author. (Subject and Keywords can also be filled in)</li>
<li><p>Under <strong>Initial Views</strong> change the following</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layout and Magnification</strong></li>
<li>Navigation Tab: <strong>Bookmarks Panel and pages</strong></li>
<li>Magnification: <strong>Fit Page</strong></li>
<li>Open to Page: <strong>1</strong></li>
<li><strong>Window Options</strong></li>
<li>Check <strong>Center window on Screen</strong></li>
<li><strong>Show</strong> &gt; <strong>Document Title<br />

alt="Image demonstrate the changes required in the initial views tab." /><br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p></li>
<li>Under the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab select
<strong>Language</strong> and change to the preferred language. If a
different natural language is used for a paragraph or selected text,
this also needs to be clearly indicated.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Screen-Shot-2019-12-09-at-11.12.50-AM.png"
class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2047" width="608" height="586"
alt="Image locates the placement of the language bar in the advance tab." /></li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected element</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Navigation Panels &gt;
Tags</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Tags</strong> tab, select the element</li>
<li>Right-click* the element and select
<strong>Properties…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Content</strong> tab, select the language from the
<strong>Language</strong> drop-down list</li>
<li>Select <strong>Close</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To set the page structure to document structure</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select all the pages (<em>ctrl + A or cmd + A</em>) in the page
<strong>Thumbnails Panel</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Page Properties<br />

<li>Select <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span
id="chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_a11-7"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 7. Adjust Security Settings</h2>
<p>It is possible to specify that no part of an accessible PDF is to be
copied, printed, extracted, commented on, or edited. This can be
accomplished by encrypting the document with password security. However,
this could interfere with a screen reader’s ability to read the
document, because screen readers must be able to copy or extract the
document’s text in order to convert it to speech. In Acrobat 11 Pro, it
is possible to maintain high-encryption-level security while at the same
time providing the necessary access to assistive technologies.</p>
<h4>To allow assistive technologies access to content</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt;Properties &gt;
Security.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Security Method</strong> drop down menu select
<strong>Password Security.<br />
</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Password Security – Settings</strong> dialog, under
<strong>Permissions</strong>, select <strong>Restrict editing and
printing of the document.</strong></li>
<li>For low-encryption-level security, select <strong>Enable copying of
text, images, and other content.</strong></li>
<li>For high-encryption-level security, select <strong>Enable text
access for screen reader devices for the visually impaired</strong>
(this overrides the document’s security settings only for the purpose of
giving assistive software, such as screen readers, access to the
content).</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK.<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/password1.jpg" width="788" height="635"
alt="Image show the changes that could occurs in the password security dialog box." /></li>
</ol>
<p><span
id="chapter-024-adobe-acrobat-11-pro-and-dc.xhtml_a11-8"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 8. Set Bookmarks</h2>
<p>A bookmark is a type of link with representative text in the
<strong>Bookmarks</strong> panel in the navigation pane. Each bookmark
goes to a different view or page in the document. In Acrobat 11 Pro, you
can use bookmarks to mark a place in the PDF to which you want to
return, or to jump to a destination in the PDF, another document, or a
web page. There are several ways to create bookmarks.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> An Acrobat user can only add bookmarks to a document
only if the security settings allow it.</p>
<h4>To add a bookmark manually</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bookmark</strong> &gt; <strong>New Bookmark<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/bookmark.jpg" width="348" height="223"
alt="Image locates “new bookmarks” in the bookmark panel." /></li>
<li>Insert the title of the content<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/bookmark1.jpg" width="345" height="132"
alt="Image demonstrates how to insert a title in the bookmark menu." /></li>
<li>Scroll to the page that the bookmark is intended to link.</li>
<li><strong>*Right click</strong> the bookmark title &gt; <strong>Set
Destination<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/bookmark2.jpg" width="602" height="457"
alt="Image demonstrates how to set destination to a specific page." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add bookmarks automatically</h4>
<p>Bookmarks can also be generated automatically from various types of
structures that will be in your document if you have tagged it
properly:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bookmark</strong> &gt; <strong>New Bookmark from
Structure</strong> (in the drop down menu in the bookmark pane).</li>
<li>Select the structure to generate bookmarks from.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (March 2013), Acrobat 10 Pro (Windows) enables
the production of accessible digital documents. Acrobat 10 Pro includes
an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While PDF accessibility has improved over the years,
accessibility support for PDF by authoring tools, viewers, and assistive
technologies (e.g., screen readers) is not as widespread as for HTML
documents. <strong>We recommend considering HTML instead of or in
addition to PDF where appropriate.</strong></p>
<h3>Should I use ADOD or WCAG 2.0?</h3>
<p>These techniques can help you to use Acrobat 10 Pro to create
documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e. not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e., not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e., where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity),</li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e., without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or
other dynamic and/or interactive content, these you should also consult
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">W3C-WAI Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</a>. The WCAG working group has
provided <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20-TECHS/pdf.html">PDF
Techniques for WCAG 2.0</a>.</p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Acrobat 10 Pro is <strong>Adobe Portable
Document Format (PDF)</strong>. In addition, Acrobat 10 Pro offers
several other word processor and web format saving options. These have
not been checked for accessibility.</p>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to write these techniques so that they are useful to
all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>*Right-click:</strong> To right-click with the keyboard,
select the object using the Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1)
the “Right-Click” key (some keyboard have this to the right of the
spacebar) or (2) Shift+F10.</li>
<li><strong><span
id="chapter-025-adobe-acrobat-10-pro.xhtml_drag"></span>*Drag:</strong>
Unfortunately, there is no keyboard alternative for several operations
that require dragging.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility
of your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any
specific disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is
required, it is recommended that you test the office documents with end
users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</li>
<li>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Adobe Acrobat 10 Pro (ver.10.0, Windows 7, Mar. 2011)
while creating a PDF document.</li>
<li>Tasks completed in <a

and <a href="#chapter-025-adobe-acrobat-10-pro.xhtml_tech5">Technique

</ul>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Source Documents</h2>
<p>In the Adobe Acrobat 10 Pro workflow, all PDF documents start with a
source document created in an office document authoring application,
such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org Writer. Because source
documents provide the starting-point for the PDF documents,
accessibility is very important.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible source document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document in the authoring application (from the default
blank template or from one of the prepackaged templates).</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the <strong>ADOD Authoring
Techniques</strong> provided for the authoring application (available
at: <a href="#front-matter-002-how-to-use-this-resource.xhtml">How to
Use This Resource</a>).</li>
<li>When you are finished, you should also check the accessibility of
the document (see <a
href="#chapter-025-adobe-acrobat-10-pro.xhtml_tech2">Accessibility
Checking</a> in the Authoring Techniques for the authoring
application).</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have completed the above steps, you are ready to convert
your document to PDF using Adobe Acrobat 10.</p>
<h4>To convert single source documents to PDF</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to the menu item: <strong>File &gt; Create PDF &gt; From
file…</strong></li>
<li>Locate and select your source document and select the
<strong>Open</strong> button, Acrobat will then proceed to convert the
file.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> A batch conversion process is also available from the
menu item: <strong>File &gt; Create PDF &gt; Batch Create Multiple
Files</strong></p>
<h3>Scanned Content</h3>
<p>If you created a PDF from a scanned document, then it will be
inherently inaccessible to screen readers and other assistive
technologies. The document will be less useful because graphic
representations of text cannot be selected, edited or searched. In this
case, it is necessary that you convert the scanned images of text to
searchable content using Acrobat’s <strong>optical character recognition
(OCR)</strong> feature before addressing the accessibility features of
the document.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-025-adobe-acrobat-10-pro.xhtml_tech2"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 2. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>The most basic requirement for a PDF document to be accessible is for
it to be <strong>“tagged”</strong> with hidden labels (“tags”) that
describes the structure of the document (e.g. that text should be
interpreted as a header, paragraph, table cell, etc.). Screen readers
can then use these tags to convey the document’s information effectively
to people with visual disabilities. The other requirements for a PDF
document to be accessible (e.g. alternate text, logical reading order,
etc.) can only all apply once the document is tagged.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<em>Caution!:</em> The “Quick Check” feature is <strong>not
recommended</strong> because it misses some important accessibility
issues. Always perform a “Full Check” instead.
</div>
<h4>To perform a “Full Check”</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> If “Accessibility” is not visible under tools, go to
menu item: <strong>View &gt; Tools &gt; Accessibility</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full Check
Up<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Accessible_tool.jpg" width="226" height="563"
alt="Image locates “check up” in the tool bar drop down menu." /></li>
</ol>
<p>Running a Wizard Action Full Check when the file is first created
would be ideal. This allows you to fix a few mistakes before the check
up.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Action Wizard</strong>
&gt; <strong>Create Accessible PDF’s</strong><em>Note:</em> If the PDF
file was created from InDesign, then select “InDesign CS6 Accessibility
Touch up”<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Accessible_wizard_tool.jpg" width="225"
height="522"
alt="Image locates “create accessible PDF’s” in the tool bar drop down menu." /></li>
<li>Select “<strong>5 Accessibility Check (Full)”</strong> (in the
Action: Create Accessible PDFs)<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Accessible_wizard_tool1.jpg" width="476"
height="445"
alt="Image locates &quot;5 Accessibility Check (full)&quot; in the Action: Create Accessible PDF&#39;s dialog box." /></li>
<li>Select <strong>Next</strong></li>
<li>Select the folder to save the file (in <strong>Browse For
Folder</strong>)</li>
<li>Insert <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Author</strong> (you can
also insert subject and keyword)<strong>. In order to insert you must
<strong>uncheck</strong> the “Leave As Is” button.<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/Accessible_wizard_tool2.jpg" width="422"
height="483"
alt="Image demonstrates the changes required in the description dialog box." /></li>
<li><strong>Follow the Wizard</strong> (a yellow sticky note-like pop-up
box)<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Accessible_wizard_sticky.jpg" width="310"
height="165" alt="Image shows the actions wizard pop up notes." /></li>
<li>In the <strong>Remove Hidden Information</strong> pop up box select
<strong>OK</strong>. All of the checked items will be removed.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Accessible_wizard_tool3.jpg" width="374"
height="530"
alt="Image shows the actions Remove Hidden Information dialog box." /></li>
<li><strong>Start Checking</strong></li>
<li><strong>Save</strong> file<strong>.</strong> If the file is not
fully accessible the errors (report) will be shown on the left
panel).</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-025-adobe-acrobat-10-pro.xhtml_tech3"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 3. Add and Edit Tags</h2>
<div class="textbox">
<em>Caution!:</em> Actions taken using the TouchUp Reading Order tool
and Order Panel cannot be undone. Remember to save your work frequently.
If you frequently create PDF files you might consider using one of these
<a
href="#chapter-025-adobe-acrobat-10-pro.xhtml_acc-support-tools">accessible
PDF support tools</a>.
</div>
<p>If tags are missing, then they must be added. When tags are present,
they should still be checked for correctness. Acrobat’s Help text
describes the tags as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>Text</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as text.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Figure</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a figure. <em>Text contained within a figure tag
is defined as part of the image and is not read by screen readers,
though alternate text defined for the figure is read out.</em>
<em>Note:</em> An effective way of handling very complex tex constructs
(e.g. flow charts) is to group it all as a figure and provide alt text.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Form Field</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a form field.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Figure/Caption</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags a selected figure and caption as a single tag. Any text contained
in the tag is defined as a caption. Useful for tagging photos and
captions and preventing caption text from being incorrectly added to
adjacent text blocks. <em>Note:</em> Unless the caption actually
describes the image, the figures will still require alternate text.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth
level heading tag. You can convert heading tags to bookmarks to help
users navigate the document.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Table</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a table. When this selection is made, Acrobat
analyzes the selection to determine the location of headings, columns,
and rows. <em>Note:</em> Table editing can be especially challenging.
Try to keep them as simple as possible in the source document.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Cell</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a table or header cell. Use this option to merge
cells that are incorrectly split. <em>Note:</em> Table editing can be
especially challenging. Try to keep them as simple as possible in the
source document.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Formula</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a formula. <em>Note:</em> Because speech software
may handle formula tags differently from normal text, you should still
add alternate text.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Background</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a background element, or artifact, removing the
item from the tag tree so that it does not appear in the reflowed
document and is not read by screen readers.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>To add tags automatically</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> The automatic tagging feature may be sufficient on
simple layouts, but it sometimes misinterprets the structure and reading
order of complex page elements (e.g. closely spaced columns, irregular
text alignment, and tables without borders.). Therefore, you should
still manually check the tags as explained below.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Add Tags
To Document<br />
</strong><em>Note:</em> This command removes any tags that were in the
document before the command was run. If any potential problems were
encountered, an Add Tags Report appears in the navigation pane.</li>
</ul>
<h4>To add/edit tags manually</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>TouchUp Reading Order…</strong> In most cases, it will help
to have the three checkboxes checked (<strong>Show page content
order</strong>, <strong>Show table cells</strong>, <strong>Show tables
and figures</strong>)</li>
<li>Using the <strong>TouchUp Reading Order</strong> tool, <a
href="#chapter-025-adobe-acrobat-10-pro.xhtml_drag">drag*</a> within the
document pane to select a region of the page that contains one type of
content (e.g. a text block)</li>
<li>To add more page content to the current selection, <strong>Shift +
drag*</strong></li>
<li>To remove page content from the current selection, <strong>Ctrl +
drag*</strong></li>
<li>Select the appropriate button in the <strong>TouchUp Reading
Order</strong> dialog to specify the tag type, a box should now
encapsulate the element (<a
href="#chapter-025-adobe-acrobat-10-pro.xhtml_tech3">the tags are
explained here</a>)<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/touchupreading-order.gif" width="320"
height="531" alt="Image of touch up reading order dialog box" /></li>
</ol>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for Tagging</h4>
<ul>
<li>A good place to start is tagging “Background” content, since this
will reduce the number of tags to deal with. Background content should
include:
<ul>
<li>empty boxes,</li>
<li>visible or invisible textbox borders (especially in busy areas where
they overlap with text),</li>
<li>visuals that are decorative or redundant (e.g. backgrounds,
illustrations), whose content is described adequately in the text .</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you are having difficulty tagging complex content (e.g. a complex
table), consider either:
<ul>
<li>Editing the source document to simplify it, or</li>
<li>Selecting the complex content and tagging it as a figure for which
you must then add alternative text that properly conveys all of the
information in the new figure.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To change the tag for a region</h4>
<ol>
<li>With the <strong>TouchUp Reading Order</strong> tool…</li>
<li>In the document pane, drag* to select a highlight region or select
the number of the highlighted region (or select from the <strong>Order
Panel</strong>)<br />
<em>Note:</em> If you drag* over part of an already tagged element, the
element is sometimes split up. This is helpful when splitting larger
elements to ensure correct reading over of sub-elements.</li>
<li>Select the appropriate button in the <strong>TouchUp Reading
Order</strong> dialog to specify the tag (<a
href="#chapter-025-adobe-acrobat-10-pro.xhtml_tech3">the tags are
explained here</a>)</li>
</ol>
<h4>To Modify Tagging</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Content</strong> &gt;
<strong>Edit Object</strong></li>
<li>Select items required to be tagged*right click &gt;
<strong>properties…</strong></li>
<li>Under Tag select type (paragraph, heading level, span etc.)
<em>Tip:</em> Tagging items and adding alternative text before
converting to PDF will save time.<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Tag.jpg" width="541" height="512"
alt="Image demonstrates the changes required in the touch up properties dialog box." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>Correcting Visual Side-Effects of Tagging</h4>
<p>Sometimes tagging can result in unexpected visual side effects, such
as text disappearing behind background images. The following steps can
be taken to correct such side-effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Content</strong> panel (<strong>View</strong> &gt;
<strong>Show/Hide</strong> &gt; <strong>Navigation Panes</strong> &gt;
<strong>Content</strong>)</li>
<li>Move any &lt;Artifact&gt; elements to the top (this places them
behind all other elements).</li>
<li><em>See if this fixes the problem. If not, continue:</em></li>
<li>Click <strong>Gears</strong> icon &gt; <strong>Highlight
Content</strong></li>
<li>Drag* mouse over unwanted element or the area where missing element
should be</li>
<li>Click <strong>Gears</strong> icon &gt; <strong>“Find content from
selection”</strong> to locate selection in Content tree</li>
<li>In the Content panel tree, click on the “Container” node of the
selected element and then adjacent nodes.</li>
<li><em>As you click, note which element is highlighted on screen. When
you have found the element you want to correct, continue:</em></li>
<li>If you found text that is hidden behind another element, move the
hidden element DOWN within the Content panel tree (this moves it above
other elements).</li>
<li>If you found an element that should not be there, move it UP within
the Content panel tree (this moves in behind other elements) or delete
it if necessary (remember to Save beforehand)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> The order of items in the Content panel tree indicates
their layer order in the document. If item A is lower in the tree than
item B, then if item A and B overlap in the document, A will be in
front. Some people find this confusing, so a good way to remember how
this works is to imagine putting documents in a pile and noting their
names in a list. The last document placed will be on top of the pile,
covering the others, and its name will be on the bottom of the list.</p>
<p><span id="chapter-025-adobe-acrobat-10-pro.xhtml_tech4"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 4. Provide Alternative Text</h2>
<p>When using images, it is important to ensure that the information you
intend to convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see
the image. This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text
to each image. If the image is purely decorative, mark it as
background.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank (e.g. Background images should generally have no
alternative text, other decorative images should only have alt text if
they form a crucial part of the content, message, and purpose of the
document)</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>For logos, the alternative text should be the organization’s
name</li>
<li>For groups of logos, one logo can be chosen to represent the
group</li>
<li>Sometimes text is included as part of a logo or footer image (e.g.
the image might contain a phone number), this text should be set as the
alternative text of the image</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g. for a chart or graph), provide
a short description in the alternative text (e.g. a summary of the
trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g. an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, the images should be marked as
“Background” and you do not have to provide alternate text within the
image.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text to images</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Content</strong> &gt;
<strong>Edit Object<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/Edit_object.jpg" width="227"
height="311"
alt="Image locates “Edit object” in the tool bar drop down menu." /></li>
<li>Select image *right click &gt; <strong>properties…</strong></li>
<li>Under Tag select type (<em>figure, table etc.</em>)</li>
<li>Alternative text inserts text<br />
<em><img src="OEBPS/assets/ALT.jpg" width="557" height="507"
alt="Image demonstrates the changes required in the touch up properties dialog box." /></em></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add alternative text to links</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the tag tree, select the <strong>Link</strong> tag for the
link</li>
<li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Properties</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>TouchUp Properties</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Tag</strong> tab</li>
<li>Type alternative text for the link</li>
<li>Select <strong>Close</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To create an artifact</h4>
<p>Artifacts are for objects that are not required to be read out loud
(eg. background colours)</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Content</strong> &gt;
<strong>Edit Object</strong></li>
<li>Select image *right click &gt; <strong>Create Artifact</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-025-adobe-acrobat-10-pro.xhtml_tech5"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 5. Set a Logical Reading Order</h2>
<p>Setting up reading order will set up the way the device will read the
file out loud to view and change reading order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Order Pane</strong> (<strong>View</strong> &gt;
<strong>Show/Hide</strong> &gt; <strong>Navigation Panes</strong> &gt;
<strong>Order</strong>)<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Reading_order.jpg" width="646" height="428"
alt="Image locates “order” panel." /></li>
<li>Once the order pane is selected the file will show numbers per page
showing the reading order. <img src="OEBPS/assets/Reading_order1.jpg"
width="671" height="449"
alt="Image shows wrong reading order that occurs in files." /></li>
<li>If the reading order is incorrect select the following information
from the pane and move the information bellow or above to make the
reading order correct.</li>
</ol>
<h4>To test the reading order</h4>
<p>Sometimes it may not be clear by looking at content, what would be
the most logical aural reading order. In these cases, it is recommended
to preview the reading order.</p>
<div class="textbox">
<em>Caution!:</em> The “Read Out Loud” feature is <strong>not
recommended</strong> for checking the aural order because it will
provide an inaccurate .
</div>
<p>One method for testing the reading order of your document is called
“reflowing”, which temporarily presents it as a single column that is
the width of the document pane. Only readable text appears in the reflow
view. If the tagged PDF does not reflow the way you want, it means that
the content order or reading order of the PDF contains inconsistencies.
If this is the case, in addition to correcting the reading order, it may
also be helpful to edit the document tags.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Zoom &gt; Reflow</strong></li>
<li>To return to regular view, go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Zoom
&gt; Reflow</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Another way to test the aural accessibility of a document is to
attempt to access the document with the screen readers that your readers
will use (e.g., NVDA or JAWS on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac OS).</p>
<h2>Technique 6. Set Document Properties</h2>
<p>It is important to set up the PDF correctly in order for assistive
technologies (e.g. screen readers) to be able to present your document
accurately.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Properties</strong><em>keyboard
shortcut:</em> Ctrl + D (on windows), Cmd + D (on Mac)</li>
<li>Under <strong>Descriptions</strong> tab fill in the title and
author. (Subject and Keywords can also be filled in)</li>
<li><p>Under <strong>Initial Views</strong> change the following</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layout and Magnification</strong></li>
<li>Navigation Tab: <strong>Bookmarks Panel and pages</strong></li>
<li>Magnification: <strong>Fit Page</strong></li>
<li>Open to Page: <strong>1</strong> <strong>Window
Options</strong></li>
<li>Check <strong>Center window on Screen</strong></li>

</ol>
<h2>Technique 7. Adjust Security Settings</h2>
<p>It is possible to specify that no part of an accessible PDF is to be
copied, printed, extracted, commented on, or edited. This can be
accomplished by encrypting the document with password security. However,
this could interfere with a screen reader’s ability to read the
document, because screen readers must be able to copy or extract the
document’s text in order to convert it to speech. In Acrobat 10 Pro, it
is possible to maintain high-encryption-level security while at the same
time providing the necessary access to assistive technologies.</p>
<h4>To allow assistive technologies access to content</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt;Properties &gt; Security
Properties</strong></li>
<li><strong>Security Method</strong> &gt; <strong>Password
Security</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Password Security – Settings</strong> dialog, under
<strong>Permissions</strong>, select <strong>Restrict editing and
printing of the document</strong></li>
<li>For low-encryption-level security, select <strong>Enable copying of
text, images, and other content</strong></li>
<li>For high-encryption-level security, select <strong>Enable text
access for screen reader devices for the visually impaired</strong>
(this overrides the document’s security settings only for the purpose of
giving assistive software, such as screen readers, access to the
content)</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/adobeXpasswordsecurity.png" width="822"
height="650"
alt="Image of changes that should occur in the password security dialog box" /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Set Bookmarks</h2>
<p>A bookmark is a type of link with representative text in the
<strong>Bookmarks</strong> panel in the navigation pane. Each bookmark
goes to a different view or page in the document. In Acrobat 10 Pro, you
can use bookmarks to mark a place in the PDF to which you want to
return, or to jump to a destination in the PDF, another document, or a
web page. There are several ways to create bookmarks.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> An Acrobat user can only add bookmarks to a document
only if the security settings allow it.</p>
<h4>To add a bookmark manually</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bookmark</strong> &gt; <strong>New Bookmark<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/bookmark.jpg" width="348" height="223"
alt="Image locates “new bookmarks” in the bookmark panel." /></li>
<li>Insert the title of the content<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/bookmark1.jpg" width="345" height="132"
alt="Image demonstrates how to insert a title in the bookmark menu." /></li>
<li>Scroll to the page that the bookmark is intended to link.</li>
<li><strong>*Right click</strong> the bookmark title &gt; <strong>Set
Destination<br />
</strong><img src="OEBPS/assets/bookmark2.jpg" width="650" height="492"
alt="Image demonstrates how to set destination to a specific page." /></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add bookmarks automatically</h4>
<p>Bookmarks can also be generated automatically from various types of
structure that will be in your document if you have tagged it
properly:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bookmark</strong> &gt; <strong>New Bookmark from
Structure</strong> (in the drop down menu in the bookmark pane)</li>
<li>Select the structure to generate bookmarks from.</li>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
<p>At the time of testing (January 19, 2011), Acrobat 9 Pro (Windows)
enables the production of accessible digital office documents. Acrobat 9
Pro includes an accessibility checking feature.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> While PDF accessibility has improved over the years,
accessibility support for PDF by authoring tools, viewers and assistive
technologies (e.g. screen readers) is not as widespread as for HTML
documents. <strong>We recommend considering HTML instead of or in
addition to PDF where appropriate.</strong></p>
<h3>Should I use ADOD or WCAG 2.0?</h3>
<p>These techniques can help you to use Acrobat 9 Pro to create
documents that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intended to be used by people</strong> (i.e. not computer
code),</li>
<li><strong>Text-based</strong> (i.e. not simply images, although they
may contain images),</li>
<li><strong>Fully printable</strong> (i.e. where dynamic features are
limited to automatic page numbering, table of contents, etc. and do not
include audio, video, or embedded interactivity),</li>
<li><strong>Self-contained</strong> (i.e. without hyperlinks to other
documents, unlike web content), and</li>
<li><strong>Typical of office-style workflows</strong> (Reports,
letters, memos, budgets, presentations, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> If you are creating forms, web pages, applications, or
other dynamic and/or interactive content, these you should also consult
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">W3C-WAI Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)</a>. The WCAG working group has
provided <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG20-TECHS/pdf.html">PDF
Techniques for WCAG 2.0</a>.</p>
<h3>File Formats</h3>
<p>The default file format for Acrobat 9 Pro is <strong>Adobe Portable
Document Format (PDF)</strong>. Several other word processor and web
format saving options are also offered, but these have not been checked
for accessibility.</p>
<h3>Document Conventions</h3>
<p>We have tried to write these techniques so that they are useful to
all authors, regardless of whether they use a mouse. However, for
clarity there are several instances where mouse-only language is used.
Below are the mouse-only terms and their keyboard alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span
id="chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_right-click"></span>*Right-click:</strong>
To right-click with the keyboard, select the object using the
Shift+Arrow keys and then press either (1) the “Right-Click” key (some
keyboard have this to the right of the spacebar) or (2) Shift+F10.</li>
<li><strong><span
id="chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_drag"></span>*Drag:</strong>
Unfortunately, there is no keyboard alternative for several operations
that require dragging.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disclaimer and Testing Details:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Following these techniques will increase the accessibility
of your documents, but it does not guarantee accessibility to any
specific disability groups</strong>. In cases where more certainty is
required, it is recommended that you test the office documents with end
users with disabilities, including screen reader users.</li>
<li>The application-specific steps and screenshots in this document were
created using Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro (ver.9.0.0, Windows 7, Jan. 2011)
while creating a PDF document.</li>
<li>Tasks completed in <a
href="#chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_tech3">Technique 3</a>, <a
href="#chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_tech4">Technique 4</a>, and
<a href="#chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_tech5">Technique 5</a>
cannot be undone. It is recommended that you save your PDF document
before and after you make significant changes.</li>
<li>This document is provided for information purposes only and is

</ul>
<h2>Technique 1. Use Accessible Source Documents</h2>
<p>In the Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro workflow, all PDF documents start with a
source document created in an office document authoring application,
such as Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org Writer. Because source
documents provide the starting-point for the PDF documents,
accessibility is very important.</p>
<h4>To create an accessible source document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Create a new document in the authoring application (from the default
blank template or from one of the prepackaged templates).</li>
<li>Ensure that you follow the <strong>ADOD Authoring
Techniques</strong> provided for the authoring application (available
at: <a href="#front-matter-002-how-to-use-this-resource.xhtml"
target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to Use This
Resource</a>).</li>
<li>When you are finished, you should also check the accessibility of
the document (see “Accessibility Checking” in the Authoring Techniques
for the authoring application).</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have completed the above steps, you are ready to convert
your document to PDF using Adobe Acrobat 9.</p>
<h4>To convert single source documents to PDF</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to the menu item: <strong>File &gt; Create PDF &gt; From
file…</strong></li>
<li>Locate and select your source document and select the
<strong>Open</strong> button, Acrobat will then proceed to convert the
file.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> A batch conversion process is also available from the
menu item: <strong>File &gt; Create PDF &gt; Batch Create Multiple
Files</strong></p>
<h3>Scanned Content</h3>
<p>If you created a PDF from a scanned document, then it will be
inherently inaccessible to screen readers and other assistive
technologies.The document will be less useful because graphic
representations of text cannot be selected, edited or searched.</p>
<p>In this case, it is necessary that you convert the scanned images of
text to searchable content using Acrobat’s <strong>optical character
recognition (OCR)</strong> feature before addressing the accessibility
features of the document.</p>
<h2>Technique 2. Check Accessibility</h2>
<p>The most basic requirement for a PDF document to be accessible is for
it to be <strong>“tagged”</strong> with hidden labels (“tags”) that
describes the structure of the document (e.g. that text should be
interpreted as a header, paragraph, table cell, etc.). Screen readers
can then use these tags to convey the document’s information effectively
to people with visual disabilities.</p>
<p>The other requirements for a PDF document to be accessible (e.g.
alternate text, logical reading order, etc.) can only all apply once the
document is tagged.</p>
<p><em>Caution!:</em> The “Quick Check” feature is <strong>not
recommended</strong> because it misses some important accessibility
issues. Always perform a “Full Check” instead.</p>
<h4>To perform a “Full Check”</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Full
check</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Report and Comment Options</strong>, select how you
would like to view the results</li>
<li>If you would like to do a full check on individual sections of a
document, under <strong>Page Range</strong>, select a page range (when
you have a large document, running a full check on one section at a time
can be more efficient.)</li>
<li>Under <strong>Checking Options</strong>, select an accessibility
standard from the <strong>Name</strong> drop-down list</li>
<li>Under <strong>Checking Options</strong>, select <strong>Select
All</strong> to run a complete accessibility check</li>
<li>Select <strong>Start Checking<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Acrobat9Pro_4.png" width="480" height="555"
alt="Image demonstrates location of page range option, format option, Select All button and Start Checking button." /></strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_tech3"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 3. Add and Edit Tags</h2>
<div class="textbox">
<em>Caution!:</em> Actions taken using the TouchUp Reading Order tool
and Order Panel cannot be undone. Remember to save your work frequently.
If you frequently create PDF files you might consider using one of these
<a
href="#chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_acc-support-tools">accessible
PDF support tools</a>.
</div>
<p>If tags are missing, then they must be added. When tags are present,
they should still be checked for correctness. Acrobat’s Help text
describes the tags as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><span
id="chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_tag-types"></span>Text</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as text.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Figure</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a figure. <em>Text contained within a figure tag
is defined as part of the image and is not read by screen readers,
though alternate text defined for the figure is read out.Note:</em> An
effective way of handling very complex tex constructs (e.g. flow charts)
is to group it all as a figure and provide alt text.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Form Field</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a form field.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Figure/Caption</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags a selected figure and caption as a single tag. Any text contained
in the tag is defined as a caption. Useful for tagging photos and
captions and preventing caption text from being incorrectly added to
adjacent text blocks. <em>Note:</em> Unless the caption actually
describes the image, the figures will still require alternate text.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth
level heading tag. You can convert heading tags to bookmarks to help
users navigate the document.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Table</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a table. When this selection is made, Acrobat
analyzes the selection to determine the location of headings, columns,
and rows. <em>Note:</em> Table editing can be especially challenging.
Try to keep them as simple as possible in the source document.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Cell</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a table or header cell. Use this option to merge
cells that are incorrectly split. <em>Note:</em> Table editing can be
especially challenging. Try to keep them as simple as possible in the
source document.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Formula</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a formula. <em>Note:</em> Because speech software
may handle formula tags differently from normal text, you should still
add alternate text.
</dd>
<dt><strong>Background</strong></dt>
<dd>
Tags the selection as a background element, or artifact, removing the
item from the tag tree so that it does not appear in the reflowed
document and is not read by screen readers.
</dd>
</dl>
<h4>To add tags automatically</h4>
<p><em>Note:</em> The automatic tagging feature may work for simple
layouts, but it sometimes misinterprets the structure and reading order
of complex page elements (e.g., closely spaced columns, irregular text
alignment, and tables without borders). Therefore, you should still
manually check the tags as explained below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; Add Tags
To Document</strong>
<div>
<em>Note:</em> This command removes any tags that are present in the
document before the command was run. If any potential problems are
encountered, an Add Tags Report appears in the navigation pane.
</div></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add/edit tags manually</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; TouchUp
Reading Order…</strong><br />
In most cases, it will help to have the three checkboxes checked
(<strong>Show page content order</strong>, <strong>Show table
cells</strong>, <strong>Show tables, and figures</strong>).</li>
<li>Using the <strong>TouchUp Reading Order</strong> tool, <a
href="#chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_drag">drag*</a> within the
document pane to select a region of the page that contains one type of
content (e.g., a text block).</li>
<li>To add more page content to the current selection, <strong>Shift +
drag*</strong></li>
<li>To remove page content from the current selection, <strong>Ctrl +
drag*</strong></li>
<li>Select the appropriate button in the <strong>TouchUp Reading
Order</strong> dialog to specify the tag type, a box should now
encapsulate the element (<a
href="#chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_tag-types">the tags are
explained above</a>)<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Acrobat9Pro_8.png" width="274" height="477"
alt="Image demonstrates the location of the buttons for selecting the tag type." /></li>
</ol>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for Tagging</h4>
<ul>
<li>A good place to start is tagging “Background” content, since this
will reduce the number of tags to deal with. Background content should
include:
<ul>
<li>empty boxes,</li>
<li>visible or invisible textbox borders (especially in busy areas where
they overlap with text),</li>
<li>visuals that are decorative or redundant (e.g., backgrounds,
illustrations), whose content is described adequately in the text .</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you are having difficulty tagging complex content (e.g., a
complex table), consider either:
<ul>
<li>Editing the source document to simplify it, or</li>
<li>Selecting the complex content and tagging it as a figure for which
you must then add alternative text that properly conveys all of the
information in the new figure</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To change the tag for a region</h4>
<ol>
<li>With the <strong>TouchUp Reading Order</strong> tool…</li>
<li>In the document pane, drag* to select a highlight region or select
the number of the highlighted region (or select from the <strong>Order
Panel</strong>)
<div>
<em>Note:</em> If you drag* over part of an already tagged element, the
element is sometimes split up. This is helpful when splitting larger
elements to ensure correct reading over of sub-elements.
</div></li>
<li>Select the appropriate button in the <strong>TouchUp Reading
Order</strong> dialog to specify the tag (<a
href="#chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_tag-types">the tags are
explained here</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p><span id="chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_tech4"></span></p>
<h2>Technique 4. Provide Alternative Text</h2>
<p>When using images, it is important to ensure that the information you
intend to convey by the image is also conveyed to people who cannot see
the image. This can be accomplished by adding concise alternative text
to each image. If the image is purely decorative, mark it as
background.</p>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing alternative text</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>If the image does not convey any useful information, leave the
alternative text blank (e.g., Background images should generally have no
alt text, other decorative images should only have alt text if they form
a crucial part of the content, message, and purpose of the
document)</li>
<li>If the image contains meaningful text, ensure all of the text is
replicated</li>
<li>For logos, the alternative text should be the organization name</li>
<li>For groups of logos, one logo can be chosen to represent the
group</li>
<li>Sometimes text is included as part of a logo or footer image (e.g.,
the image might contain a phone number), this text should be set as the
alternative text of the image</li>
<li>Alternative text should be fairly short, usually a sentence or less
and rarely more than two sentences</li>
<li>If more description is required (e.g., for a chart or graph),
provide a short description in the alternative text (e.g., a summary of
the trend) and more detail in the long description, see below</li>
<li>Test by having others review the document with the images replaced
by the alternative text</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="textbox shaded">
<h4>Tips for writing longer descriptions</h4>
<ul>
<li>Long descriptions should be used when text alternatives (see above)
are insufficient to answer the question “what information is the image
conveying?”</li>
<li>In some situations, the information being conveyed will be how an
image looks (e.g., an artwork, architectural detail, etc.). In these
cases, try to describe the image without making too many of your own
assumptions.</li>
<li>One approach is to imagine you are describing the image to a person
over the phone</li>
<li>Ensure that you still provide concise alternative text to help
readers decide if they are interested in the longer description.</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can include the same information conveyed by the
image within the body of the document, providing the images as an
alternate to the text. In that case, the images should be marked as
background and you do not have to provide alternate text within the
image.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<h4>To add alternative text using the Navigation Panel</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Navigation Panels &gt;
Tags</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Tags</strong> tab, select the element</li>
<li><a
href="#chapter-026-adobe-acrobat-9-pro.xhtml_right-click">Right-click*</a>
the element and select <strong>Properties…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Tag</strong> tab, fill in the alternative text in the
<strong>Alternative Text</strong> box<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Acrobat9Pro_11.png" width="426" height="373"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Tag tab and Alternate text box in the TouchUp Properties dialog." /></li>
<li>Select <strong>Close</strong></li>
</ol>
<div>
<p><em>Tip:</em> If you have a number of images arranged together, pick
the main image and assign alternative text to it that describes the
whole. Then, mark the secondary images as Background to be ignored (i.e.
untag them)</p>
</div>
<h4>To add alternative text directly to the element</h4>
<ol>
<li>Right-click* the element and select <strong>Edit Alternate
Text…</strong></li>
<li>Enter the alternative text in the <strong>Alternate Text</strong>
box</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To add alternative text to links</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the tag tree, select the <strong>Link</strong> tag for the
link</li>
<li>Select <strong>Options &gt; Properties</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>TouchUp Properties</strong> dialog, select the
<strong>Tag</strong> tab</li>
<li>Type alternative text for the link</li>
<li>Select <strong>Close</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Correcting visual side-effects of tagging</h4>
<p>Sometimes tagging can result in unexpected visual side effects, such
as text disappearing behind background images. The following steps can
be taken to correct such side-effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Content</strong> panel (this is another option in the
same location as the <strong>Order</strong> panel)</li>
<li>Move any &lt;Artifact&gt; elements to the top (this places them
behind all other elements).</li>
<li><em>See if this fixes the problem. If not, continue:</em></li>
<li>Click <strong>Gears</strong> icon &gt; <strong>Highlight
Content</strong></li>
<li>Drag* mouse over unwanted element or the area where missing element
should be</li>
<li>Click <strong>Gears</strong> icon &gt; <strong>“Find content from
selection”</strong> to locate selection in Content tree</li>
<li>In the Content panel tree, click on the “Container” node of the
selected element and then adjacent nodes.</li>
<li>As you click, note which element is highlighted on screen. When you
have found the element you want to correct, continue:</li>
<li>If you found text that is hidden behind another element, move the
hidden element DOWN within the Content panel tree (this moves it above
other elements).</li>
<li>If you found an element that should not be there, move it UP within
the Content panel tree (this moves in behind other elements) or delete
it if necessary (remember to Save beforehand)</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> The order of items in the Content panel tree indicates
their layer order in the document. If item A is lower in the tree than
item B, then if item A and B overlap in the document, A will be in
front. Some people find this confusing, so a good way to remember how
this works is to imagine putting documents in a pile and noting their
names in a list. The last document placed will be on top of the pile,
covering the others, and its name will be on the bottom of the list.</p>

<h2>Technique 5. Set a Logical Reading Order</h2>
<p>The order in which elements in a document are read by assistive
software is determined by the reading order. Each section of page
content appears as a separate highlighted region and is numbered
according to its placement in the reading order. You can change the
reading order of the highlighted regions without changing the actual
appearance of the PDF. For example, by reordering highlighted regions on
the page, you can make a figure and caption read at the specific point
that they are referenced in the text without actually moving the
elements on the page.</p>
<h4>To correct the reading order</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Accessibility &gt; TouchUp
Reading Order…</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Show Order Panel</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Order</strong> tab, navigate through the list of
highlighted regions that appear in the document pane<br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Acrobat9Pro_14.png"
alt="Image demonstrates the relationship between the numbered items in the order panel tree and the numbered items in the document pane." /></li>
<li>If a highlighted region is misplaced, right-click* and select
<strong>Cut</strong></li>
<li>Navigate to the location where the region should be placed,
right-click* the item above the location in the list and select
<strong>Paste</strong>. After you drag* an item to a new location, the
highlighted regions are renumbered accordingly.
<div>
<em>Note:</em> You can also complete steps 4 and 5 by dragging* the tag
for the region to the location you want. As well, you can select and
move multiple adjacent regions at once.
</div></li>
</ol>
<h4>To test the reading order</h4>
<p>Sometimes it may not be clear by looking at content, what would be
the most logical aural reading order. In these cases, it is recommended
to preview the reading order.</p>
<p><em>Caution!:</em> The “Read Out Loud” feature is <strong>not
recommended</strong> for checking the aural order because it will
provide an inaccurate .</p>
<p>One method for testing the reading order of your document is called
“reflowing”, which temporarily presents it as a single column that is
the width of the document pane. Only readable text appears in the reflow
view.</p>
<p>If the tagged PDF does not reflow the way you want, it means that the
content order or reading order of the PDF contains inconsistencies. If
this is the case, in addition to correcting the reading order, it may
also be helpful to edit the document tags.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Zoom &gt; Reflow</strong></li>
<li>To return to regular view, go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Zoom
&gt; Reflow</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Another way to test the aural accessibility of a document is to
attempt to access the document with the screen readers that your readers
will use (e.g. NVDA or JAWS on Windows, VoiceOver on Mac OS).</p>
<h2>Technique 6. Set Document Properties</h2>
<h3>6.1 Document Language</h3>
<p>It is important to set up the PDF correctly in order for assistive
technologies (e.g. screen readers) to be able to present your document
accurately.</p>
<h4>To change the default language</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab</li>
<li>In the <strong>Reading Options</strong> section, select the language
from the <strong>Language</strong> drop-down list</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To apply a language directly to selected element</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>View &gt; Navigation Panels &gt;
Tags</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Tags</strong> tab, select the element</li>
<li>Right-click* the element and select
<strong>Properties…</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Tag</strong> tab, select the language from the
<strong>Language</strong> drop-down list</li>
<li>Select <strong>Close</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3>6.2 Document Title</h3>
<p>In case the document is ever converted into HTML, it should be given
a descriptive and meaningful title.</p>
<h4>To change the title of the current document</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>File &gt; Properties</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>Description</strong> tab</li>
<li>Enter a descriptive title in the <strong>Title</strong> box. It is
also helpful to enter descriptive information in the text boxes that
follow (<strong>Author</strong>, <strong>Subject</strong>,
<strong>Keywords</strong> or select <strong>Additional
Metadata</strong>)</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 7. Adjust Security Settings</h2>
<p>It is possible to specify that no part of an accessible PDF is to be
copied, printed, extracted, commented on, or edited. This can be
accomplished by encrypting the document with password security. However,
this could interfere with a screen reader’s ability to read the
document, because screen readers must be able to copy or extract the
document’s text in order to convert it to speech. In Acrobat 9 Pro, it
is possible to maintain high-encryption-level security while at the same
time providing the necessary access to assistive technologies.</p>
<h4>To allow assistive technologies access to content</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Security &gt; Show Security
Properties</strong></li>
<li>Set the <strong>Security Method</strong> field to “No Security” or
enable “Content Copying for Accessibility” in the Document
Restrictions</li>
<li>Go to menu item: <strong>Advanced &gt; Security &gt; Encrypt with
Password</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Password Security – Settings</strong> dialog, under
<strong>Permissions</strong>, select <strong>Restrict editing and
printing of the document</strong></li>
<li>For low-encryption-level security, select <strong>Enable copying of
text, images, and other content</strong></li>
<li>For high-encryption-level security, select <strong>Enable text
access for screen reader devices for the visually impaired</strong>
(this overrides the document’s security settings only for the purpose of
giving assistive software, such as screen readers, access to the
content)</li>
<li>Select <strong>OK</strong><br />
<img src="OEBPS/assets/Acrobat9Pro_12.png" width="559" height="448"
alt="Image demonstrates location of Restrict editing and printing option, Enable copying of text option, and Enable text access for screen readers option in the Password Security - Settings dialog." /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Technique 8. Set Bookmarks</h2>
<p>A bookmark is a type of link with representative text in the
<strong>Bookmarks</strong> panel in the navigation pane. Each bookmark
goes to a different view or page in the document. In Acrobat 9 Pro, you
can use bookmarks to mark a place in the PDF to which you want to
return, or to jump to a destination in the PDF, another document, or a
web page.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> An Acrobat user can only add bookmarks to a document
only if the security settings allow it.</p>
<h4>To create a bookmark</h4>
<ol>
<li>Select text to bookmark</li>
<li>Type <strong>Ctrl+B</strong></li>
<li>Type a name the bookmark (or leave the default text)</li>
<li>To create a bookmark without keyboard shortcuts</li>
</ol>
<h4>To delete a bookmark</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Bookmarks</strong> pane, *right-click on the
bookmark</li>
<li>Select <strong>Delete</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>To create a bookmark hierarchy</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Bookmarks</strong> pane, *right-click on the bookmark
to move</li>
<li>Select <strong>Cut</strong></li>
<li>*right-click on the new bookmark you would like the moved bookmark
to appear under</li>
<li>Select <strong>Paste Under Selected Bookmark</strong></li>
</ol>
