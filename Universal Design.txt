Introduction1

Without a legal mandate, adoption of universal design depends on acceptance by a broad consistuency, including designers and other decision makers.

Universal design is an approach to the development of "products and environments that can be used effectively by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design" (North Carolina State University, 1997).

Universal Design New York 2 (UDNY2) provides best practice design strategies for implementing universal design. It is a companion document to Universal Design New York. The first book presented an introduction to the concept of universal design, described the Principles of Universal Design and how they can be applied to buildings, and provided many guidelines for implementing the Principles in many kinds of buildings. This book augments the first book by providing strategies to address the guidelines, a checklist for use in design and more examples from actual buildings and projects. It also shows how universal design differs from accessible design.

The book is designed to assist architects, developers, city officials and others in the City of New York to implement universal design principles thereby helping the City become a "universal access city."  Thus, many of the examples are from New York. However, the ideas and examples presented here are clearly relevant to other cities.

The format of the book compares accessible design with universal design so that the differences are made clear. While many publications have been written about universal design, they often equate the two concepts. But, they are really very different.

There are many accessibility laws in the United States and abroad. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is perhaps the most well known of these laws. The purpose of accessibility laws are to eliminate barriers in buildings for use by people with disabilities. By definition, accessibility laws distinguish between people with disabilities and able-bodied people. While certainly valuable and necessary for insuring the rights of people with disabilities, this distinction implies an arbitrary dichotomy for designers. In reality, there is plenty of room for improvement in usability and safety for the entire population. Focusing only on improvements for people with disabilities brings unnecessary attention to that group and perhaps adds to the stigma of disability itself. It creates an "us" versus "them" mentality.

Universal design, on the other hand, seeks to provide improved usability and safety for all groups in the community. It seeks to extend the ideals of accessible design to previously underserved groups like people of short stature, older people, pregnant women, parents with children in strollers, people who do not speak the local language and others. It recognizes that improved usability enhances the value of buildings for all of us and, piece by piece, it creates a city that is a true home for everyone and one that welcomes all visitors with grace and dignity.

A group of experts developed the Principles of Universal Design in 1997:

[]Principle 1  Equitable Use The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.

Principle 2  Flexibility in Use

The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.

Principle 3  Simple and Intuitive Use Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.

Principle 4 Perceptible Information The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.

Principle 5  Tolerance for Error The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.

Principle 6  Low Physical Effort The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.

Principle 7  Size and space for

Approach and Use Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.

Following these principles leads to a design approach that does not discriminate and provides increased usability for everyone.

Accessibility is a civil rights issue focused on eliminating discrimination against one minority group. In contrast, universal design is a market driven concept. Rather than responding to legal mandates, it reflects the realities of contemporary societies with their diverse populations. Instead of a focus on one minority group, universal design is an inclusive approach that benefits the entire population.

Accessibility codes are focused on functional issues and minimal solutions. They do not guarantee good design. Universal design expands on the lowest common denominator of codes to address a broader mission that recognizes choices and differences. It integrates usability with other important design concerns like aesthetics, sustainable design and urbanism.

Accessibility is a finite concept. It can be measured by compliance with standards. Universal design however, has no predefined end state. Unlike a legal mandate, there is no predefined minimum level of compliance. Universal design is an ideal rather than an end state. Success in universal design has to be evaluated by how well a building meets the Principles given the resources available and the sociophysical context of the project. We like to use the term universal designing, a verb rather than a noun, to emphasize this evolutionary imperative.

[]Without a legal mandate, adoption of universal design depends on acceptance by a broad consistuency, including designers and other decision makers. This means that universal design has to provide added value beyond accessibility for people with disabilities. For example, the design of products like grab bars has been driven mostly by accessibility codes. The result is that most grab bars are direct responses to the diagrams in the codes and provide no benefits beyond meeting code requirements. In contrast, one manufacturer took a universal design approach that resulted in a very different product, a grab bar system that provides a far greater level of safety for everyone than the minimum code requirements and integrates many accessories to improve the usability and safety of a bathing environment for a wider range of people. The result is far more attractive and functional.

There are many myths about universal design. In Universal Design New York, we identified these myths and described the facts that disproved them. The myths include:

Myth #1 There are only a small number of people who can benefit from universal design; thus we should not let their needs dictate.

Throughout our lifespan, we all experience variations in our abilities. In fact, more than 50% of the U.S. population could be characterized as having some sort of functional limitation. Therefore, universal design eventually benefits all of us.

Myth #2 Universal design only helps people with disabilities and older people.

Universal design extends the benefits of good functional design to many groups of people who are not necessarily classified as having a disability or aged, but who routinely encounter functional obstacles in their daily lives (short people, tall people, large people, frail people, pregnant women, parents with children in strollers, visitors in an unfamiliar city, etc).

Myth #3 The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other disability rights laws have created equality, so there is no need to do any more.

The ADA addresses physical and sensory limitations, while universal design goes beyond just physical function and considers the differences in the way people think and interpret things (e.g., understanding signs, wayfinding, using products, understanding alarms and warnings, etc.).

[]Myth #4 Improved medical technology is reducing the incidence of functional limitations, thus the need for universal design is short lived.

Actually, quite the opposite is true. Due primarily to the rapid aging population, the incidence of functional limitations have been increasing since the 1970s, and continue to do so. As the Baby Boom generation reaches old age, the numbers of older people are projected to increase significantly, and the need for universal design will intensify.

Myth #5 Universal design cannot sustain itself in the marketplace because people who need it most cannot afford it.

There are two marketplaces for universal design, the free market and the public sector. While aging Baby Boomers impact the free market economy with higher incomes, large numbers and higher levels of consumption, the lower income population plays an important role in driving the direction of government services and not-for-profit organizations.

Myth #6 Universal design is simply good ergonomic design.

Human factors and ergonomics engineering have generally focused on the majority of users, as opposed to universal design, which demonstrates that with good ergonomic design, those who are not in the majority can also be included.

Myth #7  Universal design costs even more than accessible design.

If buildings were usable by everyone from the start, then fewer renovations would be necessary in the future and those renovations that were required would be less expensive. Many universal design features cost nothing, and those that have marginal additional costs may have a value that exceeds their expense.

[]Two key trends are fueling the advancement of universal design. First, the disability rights movement has recognized that regulating accessibility may increase function and reduce discrimination but it does not guarantee full participation in society. Promoting universal access that benefits all people is a more effective way to promote social participation. There have been many inventions that were originally created to help people with disabilities compensate for impairments. They became hugely successful when introduced into the broader market. Examples include the typewriter, the sound recording, text to speech systems, voice recognition and email. All these inventions not only allowed people with physical and/or sensory limitations to participate more fully in social roles but they also enhanced productivity for all people. Examples like these demonstrate the value of universal design and confirm the universal design concept.

Second, as the 21st Century proceeds, even in the less developed countries, societies throughout the world are experiencing a rapid increase in the number of older people in their population. In the U.S., it is expected that by 2030, the portion of the population over 65 years of age will reach 20% of the population. As described in more detail in Universal Design New York, the new generation of older people, and the coming baby boomer generation even more so, has considerable purchasing power and will have a significant impact on the market for goods and services. Cities everywhere will have to respond to their desire for continued independent lifestyles or risk losing the most affluent of this group as they vote with their feet for more accommodating environments. From a public sector perspective, the burden of supporting the ever growing number of aging citizens through personal assistance will prove to be a great burden on a declining number of working taxpayers. Universal design of products, facilities and systems is a way to maintain independence in late adulthood without increasing the burden to the taxpayer.

How to Use2

This Book

Universal design is a rapidly expanding area of practice in all the design professions. The growing demand to design buildings and sites that are usable by everyone regardless of their intellectual, functional or sensory abilities is a demographic fact of professional life because of the aging of the population.

This book was designed as a companion to Universal Design New York, produced by the City of New York's Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities in the Fall of 2001. That book introduced the idea of bringing universal design principles to the design of buildings and facilities throughout New York City. It presented a definition of universal design, a rationale for adopting universal design principles and many guidelines for incorporating universal design into development projects of all types. Extensive illustrations were used to demonstrate "best practice" universal design solutions.

Universal Design New York was received enthusiastically, not only by people in the City but by professionals and experts all over the world. The success of the first book prompted the Department of Design and Construction to produce a second publication. The idea was to both follow the model established by UDNY and provide a publication that was more focused on technical solutions to problems, especially in the context of compliance with accessibility regulations such as those that implement the Americans with Disabilities Act and the New York City Accessibility Code.

How to Use This Book

Strategies

UDNY2, like its predecessor, purposely avoids recommending prescriptive design standards for the universal design of buildings and sites. Instead, it provides strategies that broaden and enhance the usability of buildings and sites for everyone. The illustrations of best practices are not meant to be copied or imitated. Rather, they are provided to use as examples, promote an understanding of the concepts and to inspire others to develop their own creative applications.

It is particularly important for the reader to understand that the strategies listed under the accessibility sections of this book are not to be viewed as substitutes for the codes and regulations. We have simplified and condensed the requirements to make them easier to follow and understand within the context of universal design. Designers should refer to the actual codes and regulations for details. We, nor the City of New York, make no warrant or guarantee that the accessibility strategies are complete and accurate.

Audience for this Guidebook

The strategies can be applied to all buildings and sites –

private as well as public. This book is

[]targeted primarily at professional designers, including architects, landscape architects, urban designers, interior designers and graphic designers who are engaged in design of new buildings as well as additions or renovations to existing buildings. It could also be used effectively by facilities managers and developers to evaluate existing buildings and sites and to develop problem statements for their improvement.

Universal design is a rapidly expanding area of practice in all the design professions. The growing demand to design buildings and sites that are usable by everyone regardless of their intellectual, functional or sensory abilities is a demographic fact of professional life because of the aging of the population. This guidebook introduces professional designers to principles and strategies of universal design that will enable them to rise to the challenges posed by the new demographics. Moreover, universal design contributes to social and ethical responsible design of buildings and sites. It promotes replacement of our current discriminatory exclusive designs with new affirming inclusive designs that are usable by all of us. And it does this without burdening the professional designer with prescriptive standards that stifle design innovation. The benefits of universal design are best achieved by reinforcing design innovation rather than design imitation, or worse, design duplication.

Evaluation and Improvement Over Time

Universal design is a continuous process of innovation targeted at improving usability for everyone. As with any innovative process, improvement upon the status quo is always possible. But with universal design, the motivation to continually enhance the usability of a building is ever present because we are constantly interacting with the built environment around us. A universally designed building or site is as much about becoming universally usable as it is about being universally usable. There are always improvements that can be made.

[]Universal design strategies can also be improved over time. Through postoccupancy evaluations of buildings and sites, universal design principles and strategies can be tested, improved and documented. Through such evaluations, even our best current examples of universal design in buildings and sites will, over time, be challenged and replaced by better examples. Building in an evaluation cycle in the lives of all buildings and sites can go a long way to improving our knowledge and practice of universal design. This book can be a valuable resource for post occupancy evaluations. By including a Universal Design Audit Checklist, we hope to encourage such uses.

Through new construction, renovation and maintenance projects, cities are constantly undergoing improvement. Improving usability should be an important part of that process. We hope that this book will be useful to designers who are engaged in improving cities and help them to insure that their work will have a meaningful impact on the lives of citizens for many years to come. In the future, we hope to update and expand this volume with new information that we glean from the ongoing program of research at the IDEA Center. Any suggestions that readers have for us would be welcome. Please visit our web site and send us your comments and suggestions.

Design of the Book

This new book is designed for easy use during work tasks. The guidelines from the first book have been used to generate more detailed "strategies for universal design." We have also included some new ideas.

Each two-page spread features one topic area, with requirements of accessibility codes and standards have been separated out (on the left “green” page) from the other universal design strategies (on the right “brown” page) so that it is clear to the designer what the law requires and how universal design extends beyond the legal mandate of accessibility. "Tips" are provided throughout the document to give advice and suggestions. Some detailed technical notes have been included in places where we know from experience that more technical information is needed. Illustrations are used to give examples of how to implement selected strategies. The new book is spiral bound so it can be laid flat on a desk for easy reference.

Principles of3

Universal Design

Universal design is a marketdriven process intended to create environments that are usable by all people.

Purposes and History

Accessible design is primarily about court-enforced compliance with regulations. The regulations are intended to eliminate certain physical barriers that limit the usability of environments for people with disabilities. Historically, accessible design has focused on compliance with state or local building codes. These typically were based on the American National Standards Institute’s requirements. With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990 and the subsequent development of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines, accessible design has focused more recently on satisfying these minimum technical criteria to allow most people with disabilities to use most of the designed environment (Salmen, 1996).

Universal design is a market-driven process intended to create environments that are usable by all people. While considerations for people with disabilities are certainly necessary for universal design, they are not sufficient when planning and designing for the whole population. Accommodating the needs and wishes of everyone – e.g., children, the elderly, women and men – is also necessary for universal design (Norwegian State Council on Disability, 1997).

Acknowledging this greater inclusiveness, in the mid-1990s the Center for Universal Design in Raleigh, NC asked ten leading advocates to identify the underlying performance requirements of universal design. The resulting Principles of Universal Design (Connell, et al, 1997; North Carolina State University, 1997), developed through funding provided by the U.S.

Department of Education’s National Institute on Disability and

Principles of Universal Design

Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR), has since become the most well referenced definition.

Explaining and Illustrating the

Principles

These seven principles are not without their critics. Some consider them vague and difficult to understand. Others argue that they are more applicable to product and graphic design than building design.  And yet, as evidenced by

their growing international acknowledgment, these principles continue to maintain their status as the definitive statement of what constitutes universal design. This guidebook also acknowledges the seven Principles of Universal Design by explaining and illustrating their applicability to the universal design of the built environment.

[]Principle 1 Equitable Use The building’s design should make it equally usable by everyone. Ideally, the means by which people use the building should be the same (e.g., providing one means of entry to the building that works well for everyone). If it cannot be identical, the several means provided must be equivalent in terms of their privacy, security, safety and convenience. The building must never employ means that isolate or stigmatize any group of users or privilege one group over another.

Principle 2 Flexibility in Use The building’s design should allow people to use its design features in more than one prescribed way (e.g., providing a countertop orientation map that is viewable from either a seated or standing position). It should accommodate both right-and left-handed use and be adaptable to the individual pace. The building’s design should

have the built-in flexibility to be usable even when it is employed in an unconventional or unanticipated manner.

Principle 3 Simple and Intuitive The building should make it easy for everyone to understand the purpose of each design feature and how to use it  (e.g., providing washroom lavatory faucets that make their method of operation readily apparent and relatively easy). Moreover, its means of use should be intuitively obvious so that it operates as anticipated and, therefore, can be used spontaneously.

Principle 4 Perceptible Information The building should provide all essential information in a variety of modes (e.g., written, symbolic, tactile, verbal) to ensure effective communication with all users regardless of their sensory abilities. The information provided must be presented with sufficient contrast to surrounding conditions so that it is distinguishable from its context and decipherable in all its various modes of presentation.

Principle 5 Tolerance for Error Ideally, the building’s design should eliminate, isolate or shield any design features that could prove hazardous to or inconvenience any user. When potentially dangerous conditions are unavoidable, users should receive warnings as they approach the design feature (e.g., providing proximity warnings in a variety of sensory modes near the top of stairs.)  The building’s design should also anticipate accidental or unintended actions by any user to minimize the inconvenience and/or protect the user from harm.

[]Principle 6 Low Physical Effort The building’s design should employ design features that require little or no physical force to use them (e.g., replacing a traditional door knob with a lever handle that does not require the ability to grasp and turn the wrist). If a low level of force is required, any user should be able to engage the feature without assuming an awkward or hazardous body position (e.g., providing a smooth travel surface with minimal slope along the path of travel leading to the entrance).

Principle 7 Size and Space for Approach and Use 

A building’s design features should provide an adequate amount of space that is appropriately arranged to enable anyone to use them (e.g., providing knee space under a washroom lavatory to enable use by someone in a seated position). In addition, the space needs to be arranged to provide a clear path of travel to and from important design features for all users.

| Using                             | Moving around outdoors and inside buildings is the quintessential activity of urban life. Accessibility of resources, in its broadest sense, and the mobility required for that access is what cities are all about. Accessibility laws mandate that certain accommodations need to be made for people with mobility and sensory limitations, but, in fact, increasing accessibility for all users should be a primary goal for planners and designers. |

Use pedestrian barriers to control crossing locations in areas where there are particularly high levels of pedestrian traffic that overload sidewalks and add to traffic congestion

"All stop" signal period when traffic from all directions comes to a stop and pedestrians can cross in any direction within the intersection, including diagonally. This reduces the number of pedestrian crossing cycles by 50% although pedestrians have to wait longer between cycles

Provided whenever an accessible pathway meets a curb

Slopes no greater than 1:12 wherever an accessible route crosses a curb

Entering and5 The act of entering and exiting a building is more involved than simplyopening and closing a door. There are many variables involved in the

                                 Exiting         process that can cause difficulty for even the most intelligent and able-

bodied person. Prior to entering a building, users must determine where they are, locate where they want to go, establish the best route to get there, locate the appropriate entrance and negotiate the path of travel to the entrance. Once they arrive at the entrance area, users must attempt to proceed through the doorway to enter the building and eventually find their way out. Accomplishing all of these tasks successfully and in a timely manner in a complex building can be challenging, but a well-designed circulation system can make the process more manageable.

Wayfinding6

Unfamiliar environments make special demands upon us. Even the simplest of settings can involve a jumble of information that has to be sorted and processed before it becomes meaningful

Dorothy Pollet and

Peter C. Haskell

Design for wayfinding includes the communication of information to assist the building user in finding destinations and understanding where they are at all times (orientation). This involves both design of building features that assist users to find their way and maintain their sense of orientation as well as direct delivery of information. Thus there are two types of wayfinding design strategies that reinforce and complement each other architectural wayfinding design and information wayfinding design. All strategies used for wayfinding should communicate effectively to the broadest group possible including people with a wide range of sensory abilities, intellectual abilities, literacy levels, languages and physical statures.

Certain architectural and interior design features help users to construct a mental map by creating familiar models of how space is organized, by supporting access to information in all the senses and by distinguishing one place from another. There are five attributes of buildings that support the construction of accurate mental maps: (1) clearly defined paths and circulation systems, (2) markers that stand out from the general background stimuli, (3) recognizable nodes where paths intersect, (4) strong edges like walls or landscape features, and (5) well defined zones/districts.

Nodes connected with directly by pathways

Familiar or easy-to-learn pictograms used to reinforce text and to bypass language-based information

Information offered in directional signage emphasized with architectural indicators such as wall graphics or landscaping that lead to the destination

Directional information supplemented with maps at key decision points to reduce the amount of directional signage

Signs placed in transitional areas to reassure people that they are on the correct route

[][]Floor levels and their uses (e.g., entrances to the complex, offices, concourse, parking) clearly identified in elevator lobbies and at the tops of ramps, stairs, and escalators

Signs placed at intersections to ensure that those coming from all directions can detect the information 

Provide directions to the information desk at all secondary entrances where there is more than one entrance

Audible signs to provide a higher level of support for direction finding by people with visual impairments, especially where there is no human assistance for wayfinding

If technology is available, use talking sign systems that can benefit all users, e.g. hand held computers that provide visual as well as audible information

Where public address systems are used to broadcast event schedules, announcements, pages and emergency conditions, provide monitors, electronic message boards or other forms of dynamic information with the same information in visual form

|                                   | The numbering system used in buildings should be intuitive and simple. For example, in multistory buildings, all room numbers should correspond to their floor number (e.g., B1 for the basement, 101 for the first floor, 201 for the second, etc.). Even numbered rooms should be on one side of double loaded corridors and odd numbered rooms on the other. Avoid splitting even and odd numbers for different wings. |

| Parking and                       | While architects are required to adhere to accessibility requirements in facilities, they must not ignore key design features that extend beyond the actual building. Parking and passenger loading zones are critical components of any design and therefore deserve as much attention as building entrances or circulation spaces. Without sufficient parking, certain people are inconvenienced, or worse, excluded. Inability to park near a building prevents them from participating in activities, attending an event or purchasing products. Public facilities that provide adequate parking can make locations more usable, safe and appealing. |

8_(Seating)

We’re really designing products that touch the lives of many different generations.

Brian Donnelly designer Typically, wheelchair seating in stadiums, arenas, theaters and other public places of assembly are segregated in the back or front of the venue. Often spectators are unable to enjoy the performance or event from those locations. Typically they are considered the “worst seats in the house” yet are sold at the highest ticket prices. Not only are lines of sight and sound quality frequently inferior to other seating areas, but wheelchair users are blocked from seeing the event when other spectators stand.

Although the ADA mandates accessible seating areas in all places of public assembly, incorporating universal design features into the overall design will ensure equal enjoyment for all spectators.

The first barrier to Universal Design is the human mind. If we could put a ramp into the mind, the first thing down the ramp would be the understanding that all barriers that people face in the environment are the result of narrow thinking…

George A. Covington

Buildings that facilitate access to products and services should be designed to be barrier-free, age-friendly and usable by everyone. The design should enable a person to enter, determine their destination, perform a purchase or transaction, and depart with as little difficulty as possible. Such buildings include retail stores, banks, libraries, service centers, local and state government buildings, commercial facilities, and bill payment locations. Specific examples include the United States Post Office, New York State Department of Motor Vehicles,

Brooklyn Federal Savings & Loan, Bloomingdales, Con Edison Customer Service Walk-in Centers, concessions at Yankee Stadium, ticketing areas at Kennedy Airport and supermarkets.

Amenities

The essence of universal design lies in its ability to

create beauty and mediate extremes without destroying differences in places, experiences, and things.

Bill Stumpf & Don Chadwick designers

Public amenities are essential to the experience of any building, facility or space serving the community or general public. The ADA Guidelines and other accessibility codes have specific requirements for toilets, telephones and fountains, while other public amenities not specifically mentioned (e.g. public information displays and garbage receptacles) still must comply with accessible paths of travel, clearances, and heights.

Strictly following accessibility guidelines make facilities more usable for people with disabilities but does not address other issues affecting the general population. For example, the ADA requires at least one accessible toilet stall in restrooms but does not account for the total number of standard stalls in high occupancy areas like stadiums and arenas, some of which can hold up to 80,000 people. Women endure long lines waiting to use restrooms, while lines at men’s restrooms are often nonexistent. As a result, many states have enacted the “potty parity” law which calls for the installation of more women’s stalls in the restrooms of newly-constructed or remodeled sports or entertainment facilities. The law has been passed in New York, California, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, Washington and Tennessee and legislation is pending in many others. In New York, the ratio of required women's toilets to men's toilets (not including urinals) is approximately 2:1. The “potty parity” law supports the comfort, convenience and enjoyment by everyone, thereby making it a good example of universal design.

1Cultural1Cultural facilities include museums, galleries, zoological gardens and historic sites. They attract diverse groups of users including

                             Facilities           citizens and visitors of all ages, sizes, abilities and ethnicity. It is

important to acknowledge this diversity and ensure usability by everyone. Unlike many other building types, access to information and knowledge is the key programmatic concern, in cultural facilities.

When we look at the accomplishments in universal design since 1990, it's obvious that the concept is finding growing support, but as we all know, there is still much to be done. We need to talk about ways we can infuse the concept of universal design into the thinking and practices of those who plan and build communities, own businesses, and teach in the important field of design.

| L                                 | Audio visual presentations should have text captions both for people who have hearing impairments and to make it easier for everyone to follow the presentation. Open captioning should be used (always available), unless there is a special captioning device that can be actuated by the exhibit visitor. The captions can be provided using an electronic message board or monitor. This is particularly useful if there is a multiple screen presentation. |

Assembly

In universal design, solutions reflect the diversity of human beings – throughout the range of life.

Robert Ivy, FAIA

Editor-in-Chief Architectural Record Public assembly and entertainment facilities are those in which people gather for educational, social or recreational activities. They include large venues that accommodate a significant number of people as well as smaller facilities that provide a more intimate environment. Regardless of capacity, facilities should be as usable as possible to ensure that resources of the city are available to everyone. Some examples of this type of facility include: exhibition and convention centers, such as the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and Parsons Exhibition Center; assembly halls and auditoriums such as Carnegie Hall and Wollman Auditorium; movie theaters such as Loews E-Walk Theater and Lincoln Plaza Cinemas; live performance venues such as Radio City Music Hall, Lincoln Center and the Ed Sullivan Theater; and professional sports stadiums and arenas, such as Madison Square Garden and Shea Stadium.

For example, in Central Park, a concert may be taking place on the Great Lawn while people elsewhere in the park are visiting the zoo, in-line skating, jogging, swimming, sunbathing, bicycling, playing chess, boating, strolling through the Conservatory Garden, enjoying a picnic, bird watching, etc. Therefore, recreation facilities  must be flexible enough to accommodate all users, including visitors of different ages, sizes and abilities, small and large groups, participants and observers.

Typical facilities include public parks, tennis and basketball courts, recreation centers, amusement parks, bowling alleys, boating facilities, fishing piers and platforms, golf courses, gymnasiums, and aquatic centers.

Lodging

As international communication and travel increase, it will become increasingly difficult to justify national or regional differences in accessibility criteria ... the marketplace is demanding accessibility at a rate that is outstripping accessibility standards.

John P.S. Salmen

Universal Designers and Consultants Temporary lodging includes facilities that provide sleeping accommodations for business travel, vacations, relocation and other short term needs (e.g., hotels, motels, inns, shelters, boarding houses, dormitories, resorts, hospice and other temporary housing accommodations). These facilities must satisfy a wide variety of users with differing abilities, length of stay, income, lifestyle and preferences for traveling alone, in groups, or with their families. Not only is design an important factor for usability, but other features such as services, guest rooms, amenities and recreation must support these variables.

1_(Workplace)5 Good design of the workplace helps employers to attract and keep

Facilities

Design should adapt to people, not the other way around.

AD AS furniture purveyors the best individuals from a broad and diverse workforce. Achieving the highest level of usability in the environment increases overall task efficiency, productivity, employee morale and general safety. In short, smart workplace design improves the overall quality of life at work. The ADA Guidelines have minimal requirements for the design of workplaces. Many important elements of the work environment such as office equipment and furniture are covered only as part of reasonable accommodations for a worker with a disability. Universal design not only ensures that fewer accommodations will be needed if a worker has a disability, it also contributes to the reduction of work-related injuries (e.g. repetitive motion injuries) and increases general worker productivity. Design of the universal workplace includes providing basic accessibility to work settings, building flexibility into the general environment and selection of office furniture and equipment that can be adjusted to suit a variety of needs and tasks.

Elements of the general environment include partitions and doors, lighting and electrical controls, the thermal environment and acoustics. These elements usually cannot be moved or adjusted after the building is constructed unless they were designed for flexibility from the start. A specific concern in workplace design today is accommodating wheeled mobility devices of all kinds. Many individuals require the use of a scooter to reduce energy expenditure during the workday. Although they may be able to stand and walk short distances, the scooter allows them to be fully mobile. As the workforce ages, scooter use will increase significantly.

All accessible spaces and elements connected to the building from the accessible entrance 

Fixed partitions and doors located on an accessible route

Clear width of doors at least 32 inches (815 mm) and no more than 24 inches (610 mm) deep 

Accessible common facilities and public amenities like restrooms, drinking fountains and public telephones

Service Facilities

Universal Design is an approach to design that honors human diversity. It addresses the right for everyone – from childhood into their oldest years – to use all spaces, products and information in an independent, inclusive, and equal way. It is a process that invites designers to go beyond compliance with access codes -- to create excellent, people centered design.

Elaine Ostroff

Founding Director Adaptive Environments Human service facilities provide the community with central gathering places in which individuals, families, groups or organizations can meet their social, cultural, educational, fitness and recreational needs. Some facilities offer services to a specific type of user (e.g., child care centers, senior centers, etc.) and others support the general public in civic activities (e.g., government buildings, fire and police stations, etc.). Often they are multipurpose (e.g., YMCA, community centers, etc.). Because of the broad range of services available, facilities should be designed to ensure that people of all ages, sizes and abilities have access to quality services that protect and enhance physical, mental and social well-being.

  Renovations and Additions   Existing buildings can present a challenge to architects seeking to comply with accessibility codes but universal design can turn that challenge into an opportunity for creative intervention. In historic preservation and adaptive re-use, programmatic and aesthetic concerns are the primary determinants of design decisions. Code compliance is usually viewed as a constraint toward reaching the primary design goals. Less money is therefore devoted to access requirements than to other parts of the project. In universal design, however, the primary goal is to increase usability and use that as a point of departure for creative architecture. The "constraints" of existing buildings can be viewed as a context that informs the design concept. For example, the need to add an elevator to an older building can be addressed by inserting a new vertical circulation core that can be the central focus of the new project. Instead of simply adding an elevator to meet codes the concept could include a multi-story space to connect several floors, a light well, a new decorative stairway and other architectural features. This inserted core also can be given an aesthetic treatment to contrast or harmonize with the rest of the building.

Renovation projects often include additions. Such projects offer considerable opportunity for universal design. Additions not only add space, but also can change circulation patterns in older buildings. Additions, in conjunction with renovations to the older parts of buildings, can radically change the way buildings work and their relationship with surrounding contexts. For example, older buildings with monumental

205

stairways at the exterior present a barrier to many individuals. Although secondary entrances can provide accessibility according to code, a new accessible primary entrance in an addition can provide an opportunity to use the site differently and enrich the entire building in the process. The case study of the Rose Planetarium on the facing page shows an example of such an entrance condition.

Access to historic buildings is a means of providing access to cultural resources embodied in buildings. Achieving universal access to the city, then, should not ignore the need to make historic buildings accessible to all. In historic preservation, radical changes to the existing fabric of the building, either inside, outside, or both, may be impossible because they would destroy its historic character. In fact, the ADA and other accessibility codes allow historic preservation goals to supersede accessibility and refer to local historic preservation officials to offer guidance. In universal design, the conflicts between access and historic character should not be used as a "reprieve" from improving access but a challenge to find other solutions that may involve innovations in design and technology. For example, it may be possible to provide access to some important parts of a building but not others. When all else fails, the use of alternative means to experience the building is an acceptable alternative, but it should be available to everyone and improve access to information about the building for the entire public.

[]This book identifies many practical strategies for applying the Principles of Universal Design to the design of the built environment. The strategies can be used as a guide to help identify, reduce or eliminate problems

Conclusion  _(during the design process. They can assist in making cost effective)decisions and in addressing performance concerns before they become

problems. Incorporating universal design strategies into projects during their initial design stages will ensure that buildings and the urban environment in general are more navigable, efficient, and welcoming to a wide range of individuals.

There are many specific benefits of practicing universal design. Clearly the most important is the impact it will have on the citizens of the community and its visitors. The practice of universal design will support more people in reaching their full potential as both individuals and participants in community life. Citizens and visitors will find the City more of a friend and less of an adversary both in daily life and on important special events when it means even more to them. Specifically, there will be fewer hazards and hassles and more effortless movement and access to information. The City will be a better place to live, work, study, have fun and enjoy social life.

Beyond the benefits to the City's inhabitants, there are also many for design professionals. By adopting the philosophy of universal design, the design professions will be viewed in a more positive light. Universal design means striving for constant improvement. Rather than perpetuating the same conditions over and over, it means identifying and creating a more supportive environment for living in every way possible. The message this conveys is that designers care for others and that in itself brings respect from everyone affected.

Design Audit

Checklist

Design should adapt to people, not the other way around.

AD AS furniture purveyors This Checklist is designed to complete an audit of a design in process or a facility that is already in use. It covers key features of universal design. The Checklist is not designed for use as an audit for accessibility code compliance because it does not cover the level of detail necessary.

However, it is useful if an access audit is completed prior to using this

Checklist. There are many existing access audit forms that can be used. For compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, we recommend using the official ADAAG checklist available from the U.S. Access Board.

This Checklist is a new idea. It is not yet perfected but we think that many people will find it useful. We welcome suggestions and criticisms for developing it further.

For each site or building element in this Checklist, there are three levels of usability defined by the availability of specific features. The first level is defined by basic access code compliance – worth one point. The next level is a higher standard provided by basic access code compliance plus one or more additional features – worth two points. The third level is the highest level of usability. It includes the features in the first two levels plus still additional features – worth 3 points. In other words, all the features must be present to rate 3 points. In some cases, the elements do not have any code requirements so that the first level is not at the code compliance level.
