Foreword

 

An access handbook is an internal document for the use of management, maintenance personnel and new staff; and which all staff should be aware of. Its purpose is to provide a simple way of listing and explaining the features and facilities of a building, which must be maintained and/or improved in order to ensure access for everyone.

 

This template has been designed to allow managers to design an access handbook for their organisation with simplicity and ease. The template contains an introduction to accessibility in section one which can be used or altered by the user to suit their organisation’s needs.

 

Sections two to four and section eight requires the organisation to fill in details on how to get to the building, the building layout, and the accessibility features of the building and emergency equipment and evacuation. To help the user complete these sections the template highlights what is required (this information is highlighted in red and is underlined) and gives examples of what content should be contained in each section.

 

As management is a key feature in ensuring the day-to-day accessibility of a building, section five gives a brief overview of management responsibilities and section six highlights what needs to be carried out in a maintenance audit. The maintenance audit identifies items, which management must ensure are maintained, but it must be noted that it is not an exhaustive list and will vary depending on the nature and size of the building.

 

Section seven provides information on the design of accessible signage and highlights examples of well versus badly designed signs. Finally, section nine identifies some useful websites and available literature in the area of accessibility.

 

 

 

 

 

1 Introduction

1.1 Purpose of access handbook

This access handbook has been designed as an internal document for the use of management, maintenance personnel and new staff; and which all staff should be aware of. The purpose of the access handbook is to provide a simple way of listing and explaining the features and facilities of a building, which must be maintained and/or improved in order to ensure access for everyone.

 

Management and maintenance personnel can use this handbook to ensure that a high standard of accessibility is maintained throughout day-to-day running of the building. For all new staff, the access handbook can be a useful document to familiarise people with the building and the structures of their organisation.

 

The National Disability Authority states, ‘Good management can improve the accessibility of even a badly designed building’ and if management or maintenance personnel use the access handbook, this principle will become a reality. The access handbook highlights:

•      Background information on access; 

•      How to get to the [insert building name] building using various modes of transport; 

•      Areas that need to be kept clear to ensure maximum accessibility;

•      Guidelines for accessible signage; 

•      Management responsibilities;   How to Carry out a Maintenance Audit;  Means of escape.

1.2 Why accessibility?

We live in a diverse society, where social inclusion is becoming a worldwide issue and the demographics are changing; in particular the population is ageing and there is increased immigration.  A report entitled “2010: A Europe Accessible for All” highlighted that accessibility is a key to autonomy, inclusion and sustainable development 

(http://www.socialdialogue.net/en/en_lib_170.htm).  Sustainability is now high on the agenda for all and accessibility is a major factor in the delivery of a more sustainable environment.  

An accessible building has benefits for all.  It is safer, healthier, more comfortable and easily adapted to changing needs.

1.3 Barriers faced by people with disabilities 

Everyone requires equal consideration from those who commission, design, construct or manage buildings and the external environment, for example:

•      Someone who is short of breath or has a broken ankle will find stairs difficult or impossible;  

•      A smooth circular doorknob will be very difficult to use if a person has poor grip; 

•      Street furniture or bollards that is poorly sited and/or does not contrast with the background, are a hazard for people with poor vision;  

•      Even a single step can deny entry to a person pulling a suitcase on wheels, or a person using a wheelchair.

1.4 Access and the legislative context 

Access varies depending on disability and goes well beyond the physical type alone. Darcy (1998) has characterised access from four main dimensions: 

1.    Physical access, which involves people with physical disabilities requiring the use of wheelchairs or walking aids and requires the provision of, for example, handrails, ramps, lifts and lowered counters; 

2.    Sensory access, which involves people with hearing or vision impairment requiring the provision of, for example, tactile markings, signs and labels, hearing augmentationlistening systems and audio cues for lifts and lights; 

3.    Communication access, which involves people who have difficulty with the written word, vision, speech, and language problems. 

4.    Cognitive access, which involves people who have impaired awareness, perception, reasoning and judgement.

 

Accessibility of the built environment for people with disabilities in Ireland is mainly controlled by Part M of the Building Regulations (2000) entitled “Access for People with Disabilities”. The underlying philosophy of Part M is to ensure that as far as is reasonable and practicable, buildings should be usable by people with disabilities.  A Technical Guidance Document for Part M is also provided in three sections, which include access and use; sanitary conveniences; and audience/spectator facilities.  The first part of section one deals with buildings other than dwellings and the second part of section one deals solely with dwellings.  Areas covered in the document include approach; access; circulation; hotel and guest rooms; and use of facilities in a building.  The Building Regulations (2000) apply to construction of new buildings after 1^(st) January 2001 and any extension work or renovations carried out after this date.  

 

In addition, certain parts of the regulations apply to existing buildings where a material change of use takes place. Otherwise, the Building Regulations do not apply to buildings constructed prior to 1st June 1992. 

 

There are also a number of Acts that provide a legislative framework for organisations to ensure that premises and services comply with minimum accessibility requirements. These include the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, the Employment Equality Act 1998/2004, the Equal Status Act 2000/2004, the Disability Act 2005 and Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. Also, key national plans such as the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness 2000, and Sustaining Progress 2003 have promoted accessibility.

 

While legislation provides for minimum standards in accessibility, universal accessibility takes this one step further.  It is a key concept that states that all environments should be accessible by everyone, regardless of ability.  Everybody is different and there is no ‘average’ person.  

 

As a result, universal accessibility will benefit all because people with disabilities, people of small or tall stature, parents with buggies, delivery persons and so forth will have greater access to the built and external environments.   

 

Examples of how to design with universal accessibility in mind:

•      If tactile indicators are used on landings and the first and last step in a flight of stairs is clearly marked, a person with impaired vision will find a stairs easier to use;  

•      An induction loop fitted in a busy-noisy environment will enhance communication for people with hearing aids;     

•      If colour contrast is used on fixtures and fittings and tactile indicators are used on controls (e.g. in lifts) they will be easier to use for people with vision impairments;  

•      Clearly legible, well-designed and placed signage will help everyone to find their way around in an unfamiliar building and are vital for people with learning and speech difficulties;  

•      A threshold with no step provides access for everyone.

 

To ensure accessibility of the built environment is of the highest standard, there are a number of essential criteria that need to be met.  These are highlighted below with a brief description of some of their influencing factors: 

 

•      Management - Access handbook, access and safety, management responsibilities;

•      External Environment - car parking, routes, ramps, steps and doors;

•      Vertical and Horizontal Circulation - steps and stairs, lifts, corridors and internal doors;

•      Facilities - reception, toilets, seating areas, changing rooms, restaurants and refreshment machines;

•      Interior Design - lighting, colour and contrast, fixtures;

•      Evacuation - emergency equipment, alarms, signage, evacuation equipment, evacuation plans;

•      Communication Facilities - signage, telephones, tactile features, acoustics.

1.5 Introduction to the building

In this section, provide a general introduction to the building, including information about the user groups of the building (public/staff) and their number. Also describe the main functions of the building and any events that are held. 

 

Example: 

Both employees and members of the public use the building.  Approximately 80 staff members use the building on a daily basis. The building is also used for public conferences, seminars and meetings and, therefore, is used by a wide range of people with various abilities on a regular basis.  The library is also open to members of the public from Monday to Friday.  As the organisation’s main focus is on disability/equality related issues it is expected that many visitors and guests with disabilities will be using the building.   

2 Location and Transport

This section should provide information on the exact whereabouts of the building, with detailed information on how to get there from the major arrival points in the city, town or area.

This should include:

•      The use of maps;

•      Details on arrival by car, taxi, bus, train, and from the nearest airport;

•      Accessibility information on the transport routes; for example whether the bus service is wheelchair accessible;

•      Pricing and contact details.

 

Example:

Getting to the [Name building Here] by Bus

Dublin bus offers many routes that pass close to the [Name building Here].   The buses which stop in Ballsbridge include the 5, 7, 7A, 18, 27X and 45 (100% wheelchair accessible) and the buses which stop in Donnybrook are the 7B, 7D, 10 (100% wheelchair accessible), 10A, (100% wheelchair accessible), 15X, 25X, 27X,

32X, 39X, 46, 46A (80% wheelchair accessible), 46B (80% wheelchair accessible), 46X, 49X, 50X, 58X, 66X, 70X, 116, 117 and 746 (100% wheelchair accessible). 

For the latest route details and timetable information see www.dublinbus.ie.   

3 Layout of Building

This section should describe, in detail, the physical layout of the entire premises and the classification of use as described in the provided introduction. Descriptions should include information on the use of the different areas and where the toilets, stairs, lifts, and any other facilities are situated. Building plans should be provided in conjunction with written explanations.

 

Bright and Di Giulio (2001) and Bright and Sawyer (2004) describe building types in four distinct building categories/classification of use.  These are complete freedom of movement, controlled entry/freedom of movement, free entry/controlled movement and controlled entry/ controlled movement.

 

Complete freedom of movement: A building or area in this classification would be one where the user or visitor is free to enter, wander around, probably in no particular sequence and leave without the need to make any contact with potential assistance points such as reception/information desk or security point (Shopping centre, non paying museums etc.).

Controlled entry/freedom of movement: There will be some point of control usually a payment desk or security point, but, after passing that point, users will be allowed the type of free, usually unrestricted, movement described above. Freedom of entry/controlled movement: This type of environment will usually have a central entrance through which the visitors enter, but once inside, movement around the building will be restricted (post offices, bus and railway stations etc.). Controlled entry/controlled movement: In this type of environment, security will usually be a major issue and the type of visitor will be restricted (Bank, research laboratories, some schools etc.).

 

 

 

 

4 Accessibility Features of the Building

All key accessibility features of the building should be described in this section. The different areas of the building should be analysed and reported on, in terms of accessibility and recommended management practices to prevent the area becoming inaccessible. These areas may include:

•      Parking bays and external areas;

•      Entrances and exits;

•      Reception and lobby areas;

•      Circulation routes, both horizontal (corridors) and vertical (stairwells);

•      Toilets;

•      Meeting and conference rooms;

•      Offices;

•      Facilities (vending machines, canteen facilities, telephones etc.);  Provision of means of escape.

 

Example:

Entrances – Access to the front door is provided by both steps and a ramp. The front door automatically opens and reception is immediately through the entrance. Both entrances need to be kept clear and well maintained at all times.  It is important to note that seasonal change (e.g. falling leaves) can cause difficulty or risk of injury and management must ensure that the effects of seasonal change are minimised

 

 

5 Management Responsibility

In order to maximise accessibility for all, management must ensure that:

•      Circulation routes and spaces are kept free of obstruction;

•      Facilities are kept clean and function properly;

•      Lighting levels are adequate;

•      Spaces primarily intended for people with disabilities, including safety zones and wheelchair accessible toilets, are properly maintained, not used as storage spaces or locked-off during business hours;

•      Equipment such as platform lifts and induction loops are maintained in good working order;

•      Safety and orientation features to assist people with disabilities, e.g. colour contrasting door furniture, tactile surfaces on floors and colour contrasting strips, are present and renewed when necessary;

•      Signage is clear, legible and is consistent throughout the building, and is revised after any modification to building use or layout;

•      Staff are aware of how best to facilitate users with disabilities; 

•      Carpets and soft furnishings are kept free of dust;  Filters are replaced in mechanical ventilation systems;  Smoking restrictions are enforced.

 

A management template and audit sheet has been provided to assist in this process (page 33-35). This needs to be signed off by management on a regular basis e.g. every six months or in light of significant changes (whichever is sooner).

 

Other issues that need to be considered by management include:

•      Reviewing the access plan/strategy to ensure positive changes take place on a regular basis.

•      Consultation with users. This may include:

o   Consulting users throughout the design process of any building works (either on a new building or material changes to an existing building);

o   Consulting users when developing access strategies/plans; o Consulting users in the development of any access literature; o Getting feedback from users of the building to highlight what worked well and not so well.

•      Ensuring an internal working/cross functional team of staff responsible for accessibility matters is developed.  

•      Publishing information regarding accessibility. This should highlight where a good level of access has been achieved (either in a new building or following access improvements to an existing building).  

•      Providing training for all staff.  Topics to be covered include: disability awareness training, guiding people through the building, sign language etc.  

•      Ensuring all maintenance and refurbishment processes consider accessibility. 

General maintenance should also consider accessibility (see above). 

•      Considering accessibility from the beginning of all new building designs or extensions.  The first step in this process would be to produce an ‘access statement’.  An access statement demonstrates the organisation’s/designer’s commitment to take the issue of inclusive design seriously at the earliest stages^(^([1])).  

•      Ensuring all procured services (security, catering etc.) are aware of access policies and procedures and their staff receive the relevant training to undertake their duties. 

•      Ensuring that facilities management companies that carry out work within an organisation have training in accessibility.

6 Maintenance Audit

To ensure that the accessibility features of the building (discussed above) are kept up to standard a maintenance audit could be carried out.  The following section is a maintenance audit checklist, which identifies items that management/maintenance personnel must ensure are maintained.   A maintenance template and audit sheet has been provided to assist in this process (page 36-38).

6.1 Externally

Check that:

•      Designated parking bays are reserved for the use of drivers and passengers with disabilities and parking restrictions are strictly enforced;

•      Ramps and circulation routes are free from parked bicycles and other obstructions;

•      General staff: Fire alarms, visual alarm indicators and emergency evacuation equipment and facilities are kept unobstructed;

•      Maintenance staff: Both visual and audio fire alarms are operative;

•      Hazardous areas, such as plant and machine rooms, are kept locked.

 

7 Signage

The information in this section is excerpted from Building for Everyone, Inclusive Buildings: Designing and Managing an Accessible Environment and The National Council for the Blind of Ireland Guidelines 

(http://www.ncbi.ie/information/access_and_awareness/signage.php)

 

The majority of signs can be divided into four functional groups: 

Information signs – to identify sites, areas, buildings etc; 

Directional signs – to direct and would usually have arrows; 

Identification/Location signs – numbering or room naming;  

Fire safety and mandatory signs – usually taken from the appropriate standard.  

 

The information provided on signs needs to consider typeface; symbols; colour and contrast; background; lettering and directional arrows.  It is clear that the design of signage is a complex issue and to help assess whether the signs used in a building are accessible a checklist has been attached.  

 

For additional information on good sign design the following textbooks may be relevant (available in NDA library):

8 Emergency Equipment and Evacuation

8.1 Fire exits

This section should provide detailed information on all of the emergency escape exits in the building, covering specific escape routes from the different areas within the building. The use of building plans to identify escape routes and fire and safety equipment, and alarms is recommended.

 

Example:

There are a number of fire exits located throughout the building.  Staff should familiarise themselves with all fire exits throughout the building even if they don’t work in a particular section of the building.  Staff should also consider the closest exits to public areas such as all meeting rooms, the conference centre, training rooms and the library, as these are the areas where members of the public will be in an emergency situation.  Staff also need to know how best to get members of the public safely from various parts of the building in an emergency situation.  For example, which is the quickest way to exit the building from the meeting rooms on the first floor if there is a fire at Reception?

8.2 Emergency equipment

Details on the location and use of the emergency equipment should be provided here.

Example:

There are a number of exits located near the sports hall.  The nearest exit is the back door, which is located in the corridor adjacent to the sports hall.  A second exit is through the back corridor and out through the emergency exit door, which is straight ahead.  In the sports hall there are two emergency exit doors, which lead onto the main car park.  There are also a number of fire extinguishers, break glass units etc located throughout the sports hall and a first aid room is located next to the main entrance.

8.3 Important safety issues

Building for Everyone highlights the following important issues to ensure the safety of all building users: 

•      Encourage people with disabilities to make themselves known, if their impairment could compromise their response to a fire alarm.

•      In a public building, an emergency egress plan should be drawn up for all people with disabilities, formed on the basis of the general need associated with a broad range of impairments. There should be a written and practiced procedure on how to locate and assist people with disabilities.  Fire wardens should be appointed to locate people who may not be alerted by an alarm and to check out toilets, stores and other areas where there may not be any visual/audio alarms;

•      A personal emergency egress plan should be established for all regular building users, these include; members of staff, contract staff and regular visitors (clients) with disabilities. This should be more specific than the general plan and can include the appointment of a specific staff member to ensure that people with disabilities are aware of the emergency and to assist them out of the building if necessary (see section 8.4 for further details);

•      Include all emergency egress plans in the general building safety statement;

•      Fire drills should be practiced regularly and should include people with disabilities;

•      Fire alarms must be combined audio and visual two-stage systems, and visual alarms must be free of obstruction (consider the specification of visual alarms as some can induce the symptoms of epilepsy in some people.  Also, do not over prescribe);  Staff must be trained in the safe transportation of people in wheelchairs (and where necessary ‘evac-chairs’) in an emergency.  Set up a ‘buddy’ system so it can be guaranteed that one person per disabled person who is trained in the safe transportation of disabled people is on site at all times.

•      Ask people with disabilities for their guidance on how best to assist them.

8.4 Steps to Produce Personal Emergency Egress Plans (PEEP)

1.    Identify all employees who may have difficulty during an emergency egress of the building.

2.    Consult with these staff to determine their requirements for emergency egress:

a.    Which areas of the building(s) do you use?

b.    What is your current awareness of emergency evacuation procedures and equipment?

c.    Can you hear/see the alarm and raise the alarm from the manual set off points?

d.    Do you require assistance to evacuate any parts of the building in an emergency situation?

e.    What current assistance procedures are you aware of?

f.     Can you evacuate the building quickly in an emergency?

g.    Is a ‘buddy’ or ‘buddies’ required?

3.    Assess building to determine individual procedures for emergency evacuation, taking into account:

a.    Availability of assistance and what happens if assistance is not available.

b.    How do the building’s features and design affect the person’s ability to evacuate in an emergency?

c.    How will smoke, heat, confusion, darkness, noise and fire affect the individual’s ability to orientate themselves, use equipment, and follow the signs to an emergency exit?

d.    Can the individual open the emergency exit doors?

e.    Are there any barriers that could prevent the individual from reaching the assembly point?

f.     Current training and awareness of designated assistants.

4.    Produce PEEP document.

5.    Provide relevant staff with PEEP and commence training of any staff designated as assistants.

6.    PEEPs should be reviewed and updated regularly; every six months, when there are staff changes, if an employee’s requirements change or when there are changes to the physical environment (whichever is sooner).

9            Conclusion

An accessible built environment is a key element for the realisation of a society based on equal rights, and provides its citizens with autonomy and the means to pursue an active social and economic life (EC Group of Experts, 2003).  Lack of access to the built environment is one of the greatest barriers to participation faced by people with disabilities from all manner of activities throughout society.   This handbook has highlighted a broad range of issues that will make the [insert building name] building more accessible for all its users.  

 

Accessibility of the building should be reviewed every six months or in the light of changes (whichever is sooner), to ensure that the building is managed and maintained to the highest possible accessibility standard.  This may lead to the inclusion of further sections to this handbook, relating specifically to the [insert building name] building and its functions.

10.2  Literature on Accessibility of the Built Environment

The National Disability Authority (NDA) has published a best practice guideline entitled Building for Everyone, which aims to promote universal access to buildings and the environment.  Building for Everyone (NDA, 2002) shows how to design, make and manage buildings and external environments for the inclusion, access and use of everybody.  

 

Inclusive Buildings: Designing and managing an accessible environment is a CD ROM publication (Bright and Di Giulio, 2002) giving an extensive insight in how to design and manage the built environment.  The CD is arranged under the following headings: user needs, building categories, functional elements, access audits and way guidance systems.  

 

Universal Design (Goldsmith, 2000) calls on designers and lawmakers to embrace access

“for everyone” rather than looking at people with disabilities in isolation.  Goldsmith discusses making buildings safe and convenient for all their users, including people with disabilities and provides a comprehensive list of guidelines for making these buildings accessible.

 

Access Audits has been published by the Centre for Accessible Environments (2004) as a guide and checklist for auditing the accessibility of public buildings.  It provides the background data to ensure the auditor understands what details need to be considered in carrying out an audit and illustrates how to carry out an audit.  

 

Building Sight (Barker et al.,1995) published to address the needs of people with vision impairments in the built environment.  It is a handbook of building and interior design solutions to include the needs of vision impaired people and highlights their needs in a simple and practical way.  

 

The Access Manual (Bright and Sawyer, 2004) covers the design, improvement, maintenance and management of accessible environments.  As a building designer or manager, it will show you how to provide and run buildings and services, and employment facilities to enable independent and convenient use by everyone.  

 

The list above only indicates some of the texts that are available for accessibility and the built environment.  The NDA Library has an extensive range of other publications. You can view the NDA library catalogue online at  www.nda.ie.  If you require a book on loan please do not hesitate to contact the NDA Library at 01-6080400.

[1] The Access Statement offers an additional opportunity to improve quality of buildings and spaces. By considering at the very earliest stages, and throughout the project the proposed use of the building, who will use it and how it will be managed in terms of the needs of its users, the Statement will assist in achieving the highest quality outcome for everyone.

[2] Both websites relate to UK Regulation and users should note that the English and Welsh Part M Regulations differ from Irish Part M.  However, users should note it is the principles that attention is being drawn to.
