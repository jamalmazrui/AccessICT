Dragon Home v15 Quick Start Guide


Dragon Home 15 — Quick Start Guide

 

Install Dragon

1.    [][]Exit any open program. If an anti-virus program is running, turn it off until after the installation ends.

2.    Put the Dragon DVD into your PC or open your download file.

3.    Enter the serial number found on the DVD sleeve or, for a download, in the email you received.

 

Once installation ends,  start Dragon (double-click its icon on the Desktop).

 

 

Choose your microphone

If applicable, connect your microphone; if you simply use your PC's built-in microphone, Dragon will detect it.

Dragon will list the microphones available to your PC,  indicating which one is active. Choose the one to use.

 

Create a user profile

[]The first time you start it, Dragon guides you to create the best possible user profile for you.

A profile is a set of files that store information Dragon uses to transcribe what you say, such as how you sound.

Your profile will become more and more precise the more you use Dragon.

For details, click the Help icon on each screen.

 

Complete the Interactive Tutorial

[]These short progressive simulations develop essential skills including:

 l pausing before and after commands  l changing a hotkey or other setting  l adding a personal word

 

At any time, you can exit the Tutorial then return through the Help menu.

 

Open the Help

[]The Help includes tips and instructions, including troubleshooting and how to use Dragon in various applications.

Click the DragonBar's question mark icon ([]) then select Help Topics.

 

Make Dragon listen... or not

On: Dragon is listening                               One can control Dragon’s microphone by:

+-----------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                   |  l Saying commands such as “Wake up” and “Microphone off.” |
|                                   |                                                            |
| Off: Dragon can't hear anything   |                                                            |
+-----------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

l    []Clicking its icon on the DragonBar or System Tray.

l    Pressing its hotkey (by default, the + on the numeric keypad).

Ensuring Dragon listens when desired is an important habit!

Your first dictation

Open Microsoft Word, Notepad, or DragonPad. Make sure the cursor is in the document, turn on the microphone, think of a few sentences then dictate them. Say punctuation (colon, question mark, etc.) and practice the commands "New paragraph" and "New line".

As you speak, a small icon [] indicates    that Dragon is processing. No need to wait for Dragon to “catch up.” Use a natural pace and tone. Speaking in longer phrases gives much better results than halting speech.

 

Correcting errors

[]Though you can boost accuracy by personalizing the vocabulary, some errors will occur. Dragon will learn from them if you correct them, which it lets you do several ways.

When Dragon misrecognizes what you just dictated, you can say “Correct that.” This displays the Correction Menu, which lists alternatives.

If the correct alternative is on the list, choose it.

If not, say “Spell that” to open the Spelling window, where you spell or type what Dragon should have written, or modify an almost-correct alternative.
