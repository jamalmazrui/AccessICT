Part 1. Introduction

Purpose of Guidelines 

Image description, also known as text alternatives or alt text, is a message or description that provides information about an image (e.g., chart, diagram, graph, picture, table, poster). Image description may allow students who use refreshable braille and/or screen readers to answer questions that otherwise would be inaccessible. Image description is an unbiased way to provide accessibility to those test items that contain images.

The NWEA™ Image Description Guidelines for Assessments is intended as a general guide for the creation of descriptions for images in assessments. It is not meant to be definitive. NWEA recommends using it along with other sources and your own best judgment.

“NWEA has taken the lead in preparing a comprehensive document that supports efforts toward helping all kids learn. This document will serve as a starting point to any education vendor looking to build an inclusive online assessment. When creating text alternatives for images for use within an assessment, there are many considerations that determine how an image will be described. It can be a much different and much more challenging task than creating image descriptions for instruction. These guidelines, based on research and practice, and generously shared by NWEA, should prove to be an invaluable resource.”

About NWEA

Founded by educators nearly 40 years ago, we are a global, research-based, not-for-profit educational services organization known for our flagship assessment, MAP Growth®. More than 7,600 partners in US schools, school districts, education agencies, and international schools trust us to offer pre-kindergarten through grade 12 assessments that accurately measure student growth and learning needs, professional development that fosters educators’ ability to accelerate student learning, and research that supports assessment validity and data interpretation. To better inform instruction and maximize every learner’s academic growth, educators currently use NWEA assessments with nearly eight million students.

NWEA is dedicated to our mission of Partnering to help all kids learn® by ensuring an assessment experience that is most authentic to the student’s everyday learning needs. NWEA is doing so by building questions and tests that are accessible to the most widely available and utilized accessibility software and computer native applications. This will allow for a more equitable assessment experience for all students. At the heart of NWEA efforts is a commitment to providing assessments that are flexible and adaptable to combinations of unique student learning needs and easily perceived and clear to each student. NWEA is also committed to capturing and yielding valid information about what each student knows and can do.

With support from the National Center of Accessible Media (NCAM) at WGBH, NWEA takes the unique approach of allowing students to use their own software and native devices (e.g., JAWs, ZoomText, and

Part 1. Introduction 

VoiceOver) to provide accessibility. This approach pushes NWEA to the top of the competition. No other organization or assessment company has attempted this level of accommodation service. Therefore, NWEA will continue with our vision statement: We are the catalyst to create a world in which education is student-centric, relying on research-based evidence to inform each child’s optimal learning path.

About NCAM

The Carl and Ruth Shapiro Family National Center for Accessible Media at WGBH (NCAM) has been working with NWEA since 2011 in an effort to improve the accessibility of online assessments and related materials (including in-test tools and accommodations).

NCAM is part of the WGBH Educational Foundation, the largest producer of websites for PBS online programs and online content in the United States. WGBH also has over 45 years of experience in making media and technology accessible for people with disabilities. NCAM brings to this partnership unparalleled expertise with the technologies used by people with disabilities and an esteemed history of developing and implementing proven technological solutions. Its staff have participated in many multimedia, streaming media, and web accessibility standards groups at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and its Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), of which NCAM is a founding member. Since the very first generation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) in 1999, NCAM has played an active role in the definition, clarification, and dissemination of accessibility information and training. In fact, NCAM’s Geoff Freed was one of two professionals charged with designing and implementing the very first WCAG curriculum. NCAM staff served on the original Federal Access Board committee that created the recommendations for Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, and chaired the Audio-Visual Subcommittee of the 2007–2009 committee that refreshed these federal requirements (the Telecommunications and Electronic and Information Technology Advisory Committee). 

NCAM is capable of determining and validating product testing protocols, assessment methodologies, remediation strategies, and tools to test websites and web applications, documents and product conformance to Section 508, state accessibility standards, and all conformance levels of WCAG 2.0. With a deep understanding of the regulations and continuous involvement and interaction with these groups, NCAM ensures that it understands not just the spirit but the letter of all applicable accessibility standards and the related technical requirements, and it can evaluate digital assets and train interested parties so that they can follow them meaningfully. The staff in the National Center for Accessible Media at WGBH have the tools, the experience, the materials, and the expertise to handle all manner of evaluation needs, from the most introductory to the most complex. For nearly five years, they have worked side by side with NWEA.

 

Part 2. General Guidelines for Image Descriptions

Introduction

When approaching the construction of an image description, it is important to keep in mind how visually impaired students access the world and how information communicated through images in assessments can be presented to maximize accessibility.  

Image Description Principles

While the content of an image description will depend on the image itself and the item in which it resides, there are some guiding principles to keep in mind when writing image descriptions as a whole.  

Validity 

Determine if the image needs to be described. In instances where a description does not lend clarity to answer a question or where the image is explained by the surrounding text, it might suffice to simply state that there is an image (e.g., “There is an image of a car.”) without providing detail. See section When Image Descriptions Are Unnecessary for further detail and additional scenarios.

Brevity 

Provide the necessary information for the student to be able to answer the question. Avoid unnecessary long descriptions that do not appear essential to the item and might require greater short-term memory effort.

Clarity 

Focus on making the image description as clear and straightforward as possible. If the student needs to listen to the description several times because it is presented in a confusing manner, then the image description is not accessible. Always read the whole item after writing the image description to ensure that the image description ties in seamlessly with the rest of the item.

Language Complexity 

Use simple, grade-appropriate, subject-related language. Where possible, use language that appears in the item itself and emphasize the tactile quality of what is depicted in an image. 

Drill-Down Organization 

Use drill-down organization when describing an image. Start with the title, give a brief summary of the image, and then provide specific data or description if necessary. 

Example: 

[]

In the following image description, the text in parentheses would not appear in the actual image description. 

Alt text: A bar graph. Longdesc: (title) A bar graph is entitled Getting to School. (summary) It shows Ways of Getting to School and Number of Children. 

(details) •    Bike, 4.

•       Bus, 8.

•       Car, 6.

•       Skateboard, 2.

•       Walk, 9.

Integrity and Fairness

Assessments hold unique challenges for image descriptions. For accessibility without impacting the integrity of the item, it is important to keep the following points in mind.

Asset Image 

a.       Make sure the image description contains all of the vital information needed for the student to access and answer the question.

b.       Make sure the asset image description does not cue the answer.

c.       Reflect the distractors in the asset. Sometimes what might seem like extraneous information needs to be included because it relates to the distractors provided in the answer options.

Answer Option Images 

a.       Keep image descriptions of answer options consistent in description length, language complexity, and sentence structure.

b.       Respect the rationales behind the answer options by making sure that the image descriptions reflect this information. 

c.       Make sure descriptions for answer options are unique within the item; no two answer option image descriptions can be identical.

Visual Bias

Visual bias as it pertains to images in assessments is the classification given to an image when it cannot be described for a given reason. The reason why an image has visual bias can be intrinsic to that image or related to the item and skill being assessed. 

 

[]

Note: The context of an item can affect some images’ visual bias. This means that the same image can cause visual bias in one item and be accessible with an image description in another item. It’s important to evaluate the item as a whole before deciding whether an image makes the item visually biased. 

[]

 

When evaluating an item for visual bias, ask the following questions:  

Does the item present a situational bias? 

This is asking whether the skill or situation presented in the item involves situational information that a visually impaired student may not have access to. 

[]

A student who is blind or has a visual disability will most likely not be familiar with editing symbols since these are handwritten tools that have no keyboard or braille equivalent. Items that assess this skill are visually biased.

Does the item assess a sighted skill? 

If a student needs sight to be able to perform the skill being assessed, the item has visual bias. 

Example:

[]

This item requires a visual understanding of how a 2-D object transforms into a 3-D object. Since this is a visual exercise, the item has visual bias and should not be described. 

Does the image description cue the key? 

If the image description gives away the answer to an item, and there is no other way to describe the image appropriately, then the image has visual bias. 

[]

In this item, the words used to describe the image (“The picture shows a cat standing on a bed.”) would cue the key (on the bed). 

Does more than one answer option have the same image description? 

When the description of two or more answer options is identical and cannot be reworded clearly to make them different, the item is classified as having visual bias. 

Example:

[]

In this item, answer options B and D would have the same image description: A rectangle is cut into 4 unequal parts. While more description could be added to each to describe some difference (A rectangle is cut into 4 unequal pieces. The first piece and the fourth piece are nearly the same size; the second piece is very narrow; the third piece is the widest.), the results lack clarity and consistency with the other answer options (leading to outliers).

Is the image needing description too complex? 

While most images can be described, it’s important to keep in mind the skill being assessed, the language level of the intended learner, and the concept of cognitive overload. If the image needs so much description that a student would be unable to keep track of the information presented in the description, or if the description requires language too complex for the grade level being assessed, the image has visual bias. 

 

Example:

[]

Describing the specific positions of the angles and lines would require such detailed and lengthy descriptions that it would become difficult for a student to keep track of the information, leading to a cognitive overload. 

When Image Descriptions Are Unnecessary 

Not every image in an item needs a description. The following are situations when image descriptions may be skipped.

The image is strictly decorative. 

Not all images are necessary to an item. If the image is not referenced in the item and it does not present additional information needed to answer the question, then it does not need to be described. Remember: If the image is mentioned in the item (for example, if the directions say, “Study the picture and read the passage.”), it may cause confusion if no image is described. In this case, if the image is decorative only, a brief description such as “A picture of a plane” is necessary. 

Example:

[]

In this item, the image of the beach and palm tree is decorative and it is not referenced in any other part of the item, so no image description is needed.  

Descriptive words are present for the image. 

If the images in the item are labeled appropriately, giving enough information to answer the question, then further description is unnecessary. Important: Check that the labels are not part of the image (that screen readers will be able to access the text). If the text is part of the graphic, each image will need to have an image description. 

Example: 

[]

In this item, each image in the answer options is labeled with a description of what the image shows, and that label text is not part of the image itself, so no image description is needed for the answer options. The text associated with the images in the ASSET of the item are part of the images themselves, so the asset images would need image descriptions.

Tactile Graphics

When an image is simple and composed of few parts but contains details that require precise locations or measurements (for example, angles, shapes, and lines), then a tactile graphic is a good fit. Image descriptions are still necessary for these items, but the descriptions will not need the detail required if they were not accompanied by a tactile graphic. The image description should succinctly describe the shape and parts to act as a guide as a student navigates the tactile graphic. 

Example:

[]

In this item, the language necessary to describe the directions and angles of the arrows would be so complex that the item would be classified as visually biased. However, with a tactile graphic and brief image descriptions, the graphics and the item become accessible. 

Descriptions: 

A.      A round object is pulled by 2 forces. Clockwise from top: 5 N, 5 N. 

B.      A round object is pulled by 3 forces. Clockwise from top: 2 N, 3 N, 5 N.  C. A round object is pulled by 3 forces. Clockwise from top: 2 N, 3 N, 5 N. 

D. A round object is pulled by 4 forces. Clockwise from top: 5 N, 3 N, 5 N, 3 N.

Creating a Smoother User Experience

Image Description Categories 

There are two categories of image descriptions: alternative text (alt text) and long descriptions (longdesc). 

•       When an image can be succinctly described within 150 characters, use alt text for the description.

•       When an image requires a lengthier description, or when the use of bullet or numbered lists and/or tables would make the information in the image description easier to navigate, use longdesc. Note: When you need to write a longdesc, the image will also need an introductory alt text. Keep this very brief (“A picture,” “A diagram,” “A graph,” etc.), leaving the details for the longdesc. If the image is named elsewhere in the item (e.g., the directions of the item show, “Use the diagram to answer the question.”), use the same term in the alt text (“A diagram.”) and longdesc (“The diagram shows . . .”).

Consistency 

It is very important to maintain consistency throughout the item. If the answer options show the measurements abbreviated or the stem shows the acronym with the letters not spaced out, repeat those choices in the image description. It is better for a student to hear the same garbled word in the image description and the answer option or stem than to hear two different presentations that might interfere with key selection.

Screen Readers 

Students will access image descriptions, and the item as a whole, through screen readers. Therefore, image description writers should familiarize themselves with how screen readers read text and access image descriptions. Test the image descriptions with a screen reader to make sure that they are being read in a comprehensible manner. 

Punctuation 

Punctuation plays a part in how a screen reader will read text and image descriptions, and this can vary between screen readers and can vary based on the settings of the screen reader. Make thoughtful decisions about punctuation use in image descriptions and be consistent. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

•       Periods, colons, semicolons, and commas all cause a screen reader to pause, but they may create pauses of different lengths of time, or some screen readers may read the name of the punctuation (e.g., the default setting on some screen readers will cause “;” to be read as “semicolon” instead of just pausing). Test different punctuation within a sentence or in a list to see what works best for the phrasing of the image description. Remember to end each line with a period to avoid the screen reader moving on to the next line with no pause.

•       Instead of using a hyphen between numbers to show a range, use the word “to.” 

Numbers 

Numbers written as numerals will be read as the number (37 will be read as “thirty-seven”), so there is no need to spell out numbers. However, to make sure the meaning of the numbers in the item context is appropriately conveyed, keep the following concepts in mind:

•       For negative numbers, spell out the word “negative” instead of using the symbol.

•       For positive numbers, spell out the word positive in instances where there are both negative and positive numbers in the same item.

•       For 4-digit numbers, use commas (e.g., 1,980); some screen readers may read 4-digit numbers without commas as years (1980 = nineteen eighty).

Dates 

Dates may appear in different formats in different items (e.g., 12/31/1999; Dec. 31, 1999; 12-311999). Screen readers will vary on how they read these dates. When describing a date in an image, consider the date/image in the context of the item and evaluate the skills being assessed. If reading the date is not the skill being assessed, consider interpreting the date (e.g., write 12/31/1999 as “December thirty-first, nineteen ninety-nine”). Remember: If the date appears elsewhere in the item, you should be consistent with how the date is presented: match the date in the image description to the format of the date in the rest of the item.

Emphasis (bold, italics, underlining)  

Emphasis may appear in the text of an image. If a student needs to be made aware of emphasis on the text of an image, use the standard phrases “Start emphasis” and “End emphasis” around the text. If specific emphasis needs to be called out (for example, text is underlined, signifying a book title, and that aspect of the item is being assessed) use the appropriate emphasis type (“Start underline” and “End underline.”)  

Currency 

Currency may appear in items, and screen readers will vary on how they read currency. When describing currency in an image, consider the context of the item and evaluate the skills being assessed. If reading the currency is not the skill being assessed, consider interpreting the currency (e.g., write $1.49 as “a dollar forty-nine” or “one dollar and forty-nine cents,” depending on the context). Remember: If currency appears elsewhere in the item, you should be consistent with how it is presented. Match the currency in the image description to the format of currency in the rest of the item. 

Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Letters Used as Letters  

These may cause some challenges between image descriptions and answer options. For best screen reader behavior, apply the following tips. Keep in mind the importance of consistency throughout the item when choosing to apply the tips.

•       Spell out measurements when they appear in the image. For example, if the image shows a triangle with a side labeled “5 cm,” the image description should read “5 centimeters.”

•       Spell out symbols. For example, write π as “pi.”

•       For information about element symbols in images, see Chemical Elements in the science section. 

•       For “a.m.” and “p.m.” as related to time, space out the letters following time (e.g., 5:00 A M).

•       Keep a space between the letters used to name a shape. For example, Triangle ABC should be written as “Triangle A B C” in the image description for better screen reader behavior. Important: If you are using a math tool to create and/or describe math symbols, equations, coordinates, figure names, etc., keep the language in the image description consistent with how screen readers will read the math tool notations.

Part 3. Math

Where symbols, equations, point labels, figure names, etc. appear in the example item text, a math tool was used to ensure that these would be read as optimally as possible. For example, we used a math tool to ensure that “ΔABC” in the text of an answer option would be read by screen readers as “triangle A B C.” While the text may appear different, the language in the image descriptions given here is consistent with how screen readers will read the text (through the math tool) in other parts of each item. 

Base-Ten Blocks

a.             Use “one-hundred-cube flat” to describe a group of 100 cubes.

b.             Use “ten-cube rod” to describe a group of 10 cubes. 

c.             Use “unit cube” to describe an individual cube.

[]

Alt text: 4, one-hundred-cube flats. 3 ten-cube rods. 2 unit cubes.

Charts and Graphs

Bar and Line Graphs  

1.       Data lands directly on labeled points.

a.       Briefly describe the chart and give a summary if one is immediately apparent.

b.       Describe the title and axis labels. Describe the visual attributes of the bars (e.g., dark blue, light blue) only if there is an explicit need such as a question referring to the colors.

c.       Give data points in a bullet list, separating information with commas. Use a list format when the graph does not contain a lot of data. A table format might be a better choice when data needs to be accessed using keystrokes. 

d.       Example:

[]

Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: The bar graph is entitled Getting to School. It shows Ways of Getting to School and Number of Children. 

•       Bike, 4.

•       Bus, 8.

•       Car, 6.

•       Skateboard, 2.

•       Walk, 9.

2.       Data lands between labeled points.

a.       Describe the chart and give a summary if one is immediately apparent.

b.       Describe the title and axis labels. Describe the visual attributes of the bars (e.g., dark blue, light blue) only if there is an explicit need such as a question referring to the colors.

c.       Give data points in a bullet list, separating information with commas. Use a list format when the graph does not contain a lot of data. A table format might be a better choice when data needs to be accessed using keystrokes. 

i.         When students do not need an exact number to answer the question, you may provide the nearest labeled number.

ii.       When reading the graph is the skill being assessed, explain the position of where the data point or bar lands using language such as “halfway between 4 and 6.”

iii.     When calculation with the graph data is the skill being assessed, you may provide the exact values, or you may choose to describe the end position in relation to surrounding numbers. Use your best judgment to decide what is appropriate within the context of each item.

d.       Example:

[]

Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: A double bar graph entitled Favorite Season shows Season on the x-axis and Number of Students on the y-axis, from 0 to 70 by tens.

•       Winter. Boys, halfway between 20 and 30. Girls, almost at the line for 20.

•       Spring. Boys, almost at the line for 40. Girls, more than halfway past the line for 30.

•       Summer. Boys, just past the line for 50. Girls, halfway between 60 and 70.

•       Fall. Boys, halfway between 10 and 20. Girls, just past the line for 20.

3. Describing different line types

a.       Describe the labels on the x- and y- axes.

b.       Describe the shape of each line and/or trend for each graph.

c.       Example:

[]

A.      Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: The graph shows Months on the x-axis, from 0 to 10, and Fans on the y-axis, from 0 to 3500. Four short horizontal lines step up from the bottom left to the middle of the graph.

•       0 to 2 months, 500 fans. •          2 to 4 months, 700 fans.

•       4 to 6 months, 900 fans.

•       6 to 8 months, 1100 fans.

B.      Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: The graph shows Months on the x-axis, from 0 to 10, and Fans on the y-axis, from 0 to 3500. A line starts at (0, 500) and curves as the value increases quickly at first, and then slowly to (10, 3000).

C.      Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: The graph shows Months on the x-axis, from 0 to 10, and Fans on the y-axis, from 0 to 3500. A straight line starts at (0, 500) and slants upward to (10, 1500).

D.      Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: The graph shows Months on the x-axis, from 0 to 10, and Fans on the y-axis, from 0 to 3500. A line starts at (0, 500) and curves as the value increases slowly at first, and then quickly to (10, 3000).

Circle Graphs 

a.             Give the title of the graph and describe how it is divided. 

b.             If the graph is divided into unequal parts, describe the parts from largest to smallest using a bullet list.

c.             It is not necessary to describe the colors of the parts unless they are mentioned in other parts of the item.

[]

Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: A circle graph is titled Favorite Subjects among Fourth Grade Students. It is divided into 4 unequal parts. From largest to smallest, the parts are: 

•       Math.

•       Reading.

•       Science. •       Writing.

Number/Hundreds Charts  a. Give the number range. 

[]

Alt text: A skip-counting chart shows numbers 51 through 100. These numbers are shaded: 53, 59, 65, 71, 77, 83, 89, 95. 

Pictographs 

a.             Provide the pictograph title (if shown) and the units. 

b.             Describe the key. If the key shows a picture that is identical to what it represents, include the word “picture” to distinguish the art (e.g., One car picture equals one car.). If the key shows a picture that is different from what it represents, you do not need to include the word “picture” (e.g., One sun equals one day outside.).

c.             Example:

[]

Alt text: A pictograph. Longdesc: The pictograph shows names of lunches and pictures of lunches. A key shows one pizza picture equals one pizza, one taco picture equals one taco, and one brown bag equals one home lunch. 

•       Pizza, 5 pizza pictures.

•       Tacos, 1 taco picture.

•       Home lunch, 4 brown bags.

Scatter Plot 

a.             Give the title of the scatter plot and tell what it shows. 

b.             Describe the axes and the number of points, so students receive the setup of the scatter plot.

c.             Describe the correlation by telling students if the points are concentrated, if they show a trend, or if they are spread out. 

d.             If the scatter plot has a trend, describe the pattern and describe the line of best fit, if it is shown. Line of best fit can be described by stating how many of the points are above, on, and below the line, or by giving the slope. How you describe the line of best fit depends on the skill being assessed. 

e.             Depending on the item, each point’s location may need to be described. Use your best judgement to determine when the need to describe the individual points would lead to cognitive overload and a necessity to declare the image as having visual bias.

f.              Example:

[]

A.      Alt text: A scatter plot. Longdesc: The scatter plot shows Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit on the x-axis and Ice Cream Sales in dollars on the y-axis. Points are loosely scattered all over the graph. 

B.      Alt text: A scatter plot. Longdesc: The scatter plot shows Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit on the x-axis and Ice Cream Sales in dollars on the y-axis. Points show a downward trend. 

C.      Alt text: A scatter plot. Longdesc: The scatter plot shows Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit on the x-axis and Ice Cream Sales in dollars on the y-axis. Points show an upward trend. 

D.      Alt text: A scatter plot. Longdesc: The scatter plot shows Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit on the x-axis and Ice Cream Sales in dollars on the y-axis. Points are scattered in the middle of the graph.

Tally Chart 

While many tables and charts can be created using screen reader accessible HTML, tally charts often need to remain images, as the tally marks themselves are graphics.

1.       When reading the tally chart is the skill being assessed

a.       If reading the tally chart is the skill being assessed, use descriptive language and avoid providing totals. 

b.       There is no need to mention the diagonal slash; instead, group tally marks by fives (i.e., for 13 tally marks, describe as “two groups of five and one group of 3”).

c.       Example:

[]

(Note: The title for the tally charts was not included in the image description for each answer option for the sake of brevity; as the title is consistent across all answer options and the information has already been conveyed in the text above the asset table, it is not necessary to restate in the answer options.)

2.       When the item asks the student to do something with the data (not simply interpret the total tallies in a given category)

a.       Provide the total amount of tally marks in numerals.

b.       Example:

[]

Alt text: A tally chart has 3 columns: red, blue, and green. Red, 17 marks. Blue, 63 marks. Green, 20 marks.

Clocks 

Analog 

a.             When describing analog clocks, consider the grade level. For lower grade levels, use “short hand” and “long hand.” For higher grade level, use “minute hand” and “hour hand.” You may also choose to use “short hour hand” and “long minute hand” for lower grades.

b.             Use the expression “between # and #” to refer to where the hands point when they appear between two numbers.

c.             Provide the number of marks before or after the nearest number for clocks with minute markers.

d.             Example:

[]

Alt text: A clock shows the short hour hand is halfway between 2 and 3. The long minute hand points to 6.

Digital  

a.      Use a number-colon-number format when the skill being assessed is recognition of time to avoid cuing the answer. 

[]

A.      Alt text: The digital clock shows six colon zero zero.

B.      Alt text: The digital clock shows six colon three zero.

C.      Alt text: The digital clock shows seven colon zero zero.

D.      Alt text: The digital clock shows seven colon three zero.

Writing Out the Time 

a.             When the construct being assessed is not reading time, you can write the time out (e.g., six thirty) if this approach will not cue the answer.

b.             Example:

[]

Coordinate Planes

Figures 

a.             Tell students that the figure is on a coordinate plane.

b.             Introduce the type of figure/shape. Be consistent with how the screen reader will read the figure/shape names in the other parts of the item.

c.             Describe the points in the graph by naming the coordinates for each apex of the figure. 

d.             Keep a space between the letters used to name a shape (Triangle A B C, not Triangle ABC) for better screen reader behavior. However, be consistent with how a screen reader will read the name as it appears in other parts of the item.

e.             Example: 

[]

Alt text: Triangle T U V is on a coordinate plane. Point T is at (negative 5, 0). Point U is at (negative 2, 0). Point V is at (negative 2, negative 4).

Lines 

1.       Basic lines

a.       Tell students there is a coordinate plane.

b.       Describe the shape of the line.

c.       Describe the x- and y-intercepts, from left to right, by giving their coordinates.

d.       Example:

[]

Alt text: On a coordinate plane, a straight line with a negative slope crosses the y-axis at (0, 4) and the x-axis at (5, 0).

2.       Lines including shading

a.       Tell students there is a coordinate plane.

b.       Identify the type of graph shown.

c.       Describe the x- and y-intercepts, from left to right, by giving their coordinates.

d.       Describe the line as “solid” or “dashed.”

e.       Describe the slope of the line (positive, negative, etc.).

f.        Describe the shaded area in relation to the line, using language such “below and to the right of” or “above and to the left of.”

g.       Example:

[]

Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: A coordinate plane with a solid line with a positive slope crossing the x-axis at (negative 1, 0) and the y-axis at (0, 3). The area below and to the right of the line is shaded.

3.       Log functions

a.       Tell students there is a coordinate plane.

b.       Describe the shape of the line (using the phrase “curved line” or “logarithmic graph”), and give the coordinates of the y-intercept.

[]

Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: On a coordinate plane, a curved line approaches the grid line at x equals negative 1, crosses the x-axis between negative 1 and 0, and crosses the y-axis at point (0, 1). 

OR

Longdesc: On a coordinate plane, a logarithmic graph is asymptotic to a grid line at x equals negative 1, crosses the x-axis between negative 1 and 0, and crosses the y-axis at point (0, 1). 

Parabolas and Absolute Graphs 

a.             Describe graphs with two or fewer curves. When there are three curves on one graph, the description becomes too long and complicated, with too many numbers and pieces of information to hold in a student’s working memory, causing visual bias.

b.             Tell students there is a coordinate plane.

c.             Describe the graphs in order from left to right.

d.             Describe the shape of the graph (parabola, curve, hyperbola, etc.).

i.         For a parabola, describe the direction the graph opens (right, left, up, and/or down).

ii.       For other absolute graphs, describe the curve as “asymptotic to” an axis or line, and give the direction the curve opens and the quadrant(s) it is in. 

e.             Describe the vertex and x- and y-intercepts. If there is no intercept (or the intercepts are difficult to identify), provide nearest point with integer coordinates.

f.              Example: 

[]

A.      Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: On a coordinate plane, a parabola opens up. It goes through (negative 4, 8), has a vertex at (0, 0), and goes through (4, 8).

B.      Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: On a coordinate plane, a curve opens up and left in quadrants 1 and 2. The curve is asymptotic to the negative x-axis, and curves up sharply, going through (2, 8).

C.      Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: On a coordinate plane, a curve opens up and left in quadrant 2 and another curve opens up and right in quadrant 1. Both curves are asymptotic to the positive y-axis and have a horizontal asymptote at y equals 2. 

D.      Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: On a coordinate plane, a hyperbola with center at the origin has a curve in quadrant 2 and a curve in quadrant 4. The curve in quadrant 2 is asymptotic

to the negative x-axis and the positive y-axis. The curve in quadrant 4 is asymptotic to the positive x-axis and the negative y-axis.

E.       Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: On a coordinate plane, a curve opens up and right in quadrants 1 and 4. It starts at the top of the graph, crosses the x-axis at (4, 0), and goes through (8, negative 4). 

Piecewise Graphs 

a.             Tell students there is a coordinate plane.

b.             Describe the endpoints (open or closed circles, arrows, etc.), give the coordinates of the endpoints (if available), and describe the direction of the line. 

c.             If the graph shows more than three lines, reduce the cognitive overload with these graphs by summarizing the trend and giving the left- and right-most step coordinates. 

d.             Example:

[]

Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: On a coordinate plane, a graph shows Weight in pounds on the xaxis and Shipping Charge in dollars on the y-axis. A piecewise function has 3 lines.

•       The first line has an open circle at (0, 5), continues horizontally at y equals 5, then has an open circle at (2, 5).

•       The second line has a closed circle at (2, 10), continues horizontally at y equals 10, then has an open circle at (4, 10).

•       The third line has a closed circle at (4, 15), continues horizontally at y equals 15 with an arrow instead of an endpoint.

e.             Example of a summary graph:

[]

Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: On a coordinate plane, a step graph has horizontal segments that are each one unit long. The left end of each segment is a closed circle. The right end of each segment is an open circle. The left-most segment goes from (negative 5, 5) to (negative 4, 5).

Each segment is two units lower and one unit farther to the right than the previous segment. The right-most segment goes from (0, negative 5) to (1, negative 5).

Points 

a.             Tell students there is a coordinate plane.

b.             Use the origin as the point of reference (instead of the axes) to describe the points.

c.             If there are more than three points, provide a bulleted list with one introductory sentence.

d.             If a point is on an axis, do not say zero units.

[]

Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: The graph shows a coordinate plane with x- and y-axes and points M, N, P, Q, and R. 

•       Point M is on the y-axis and 3 units up from the origin. 

•       Point N is 3 units right from the origin and 3 units up from the origin. 

•       Point P is 3 units right from the origin and on the x-axis. 

•       Point Q is 3 units right from the origin and 3 units down from the origin. 

•       Point R is on the y-axis and 3 units down from the origin.

Trigonometric Functions 

a.             Name the function shown, as long as it does not give away the answer.

b.             Give the minimum and maximum values of the sine wave. 

c.             Describe the number of complete cycles that occur in an interval, 0 to 2π.

d.             Spell out π as “pi,” but make sure to be consistent with how screen readers will read it if it appears in other parts of the item. 

[]

Alt text: The graph shows a sine wave with a minimum value of negative 5 and a maximum value of 3. The wave completes 2 cycles in an interval from 0 to 2 pi.

Unit Circles 

a.             Since the unit circle is a standard image for this grade level (9–12), we can assume students are familiar with it. Therefore, it isn’t necessary to describe every point on the circle. 

b.             Focus on what students need to know in order to answer the question.

c.             Write out Greek symbols if they don’t appear in other parts of the item.

d.             Describe angle theta in radians.

e.             Example:

[]

Alt text: On the unit circle diagram, the arc length of angle theta is the fraction 7 pi over 6 radians.

Vectors 

a.             Tell students there is a coordinate plane.

b.             Describe the coordinates of the vector’s head and tail. 

c.             For more complex vector graphs (showing 2 or more vectors), state whether the vectors are connected. You may also consider using the phrase “goes from (coordinates) to (coordinates)” instead of “the tail of vector x is at (coordinates) and the head is at (coordinates)” to reduce the cognitive load.

d.             Example (simple):

[]

Alt text: A vector is on a coordinate plane. The tail is at the origin. The head is at point (3, negative square root of 7). 

[]

Asset: Alt text: On a coordinate plane, vector v goes from the origin (0, 0) to (2, negative 3).

a.             Read the equation as a number sentence. 

b.             Use numerals for given numbers.

c.             Use mathematical term (plus, minus, times, or equals) after each number. Refer to the bottom line as equals.

[]

Figures and Shapes (Geometry)

Keep a space between the letters used to name figures (Triangle A B C, not Triangle ABC) for better screen reader behavior. However, be consistent with how a screen reader will read the name as it appears in other parts of the item.

2-D Shapes 

1.       Identification of shapes

a.       Describe shape using side and/or angle details. Note: Many of these items will contain visual bias. For example, if the language needed to describe the shapes is above the grade level at which the item is testing, or if the image descriptions of two or more answer options overlap, then the item contains visual bias. Only when the shapes can be described with grade-appropriate language, using similar structure, and with no overlap between answer option image descriptions does the item not contain visual bias.

b.       Example:

[]

A.      Alt text: A shape with 3 sides. All sides are the same length.

B.      Alt text: A shape with 4 sides. 2 sides are short, and 2 sides are long. 

C.      Alt text: A shape with 6 sides. All sides are the same length.

D.      Alt text: A shape that is round, with 1 side.

2.       Calculation with 2-D shapes

a.       State name of the shape, and then give more detailed information (measurements and labels). 

b.       Make sure the student has all the information needed to solve the problem.

c.       Spell out the abbreviated measurements if they don’t appear in other parts of the item.

d.       Example:

[]

Alt text: The diagram shows a triangle with a base of 12.5 cm.

e.       Example:

[]

Alt text: A diagram. Longdesc: The diagram shows a right triangle. The height is labeled 11, the hypotenuse is labeled x, and the base is unlabeled. The angle opposite the height is 30 degrees.

Circles 

1.       Including angles and lines

a.       Repeat the plain text to set up the description. 

b.       Whenever the diagram says “not drawn to scale,” pay particular attention to the actual measures provided.

c.       Describe the line segments, followed by the arc they form.

d.       Example:

[]

(Note: The degree symbol was maintained in the image description—instead of being spelled out as “degrees”—since students will also encounter it in the answer options.)  Alt text: A diagram. Longdesc: Line segment F H is the diameter of a circle with center N. 

•       Chord K L intersects diameter F H at point G. 

•       Angle F G L intercepts an arc that measures 110°. 

•       Angle F G K intercepts an arc that measures 40°. 

 

2.       Inscribed shapes

a.       If the circle is named (center point labeled), give the name of the circle and the shape inscribed in it.

b.       Describe lines and angles of the inscribed shape.

c.       Sometimes it is a good idea to repeat information given in the text surrounding the image, so the information of the image is presented in a logical progression that may be more easily understood by a visually-impaired student.

[]

(Note: The degree symbol was maintained in the image description—instead of being spelled out as “degrees”—since students will also encounter it in the answer options.) Alt text: A circle is inscribed with Triangle A B C. Line A C is a diameter of the circle. Angle C A B is 62°.

3-D Shapes  

1.       Identification 

a.       Describe the shape using the definition of the shape, or a close equivalent. Describing the number of sides or angle details may help. Note: Many of these items will contain visual bias. For example, if the language needed to describe the shapes is above the grade level at which the item is testing, or if the image descriptions of two or more answer options overlap, then the item contains visual bias. Only when the shapes can be described with grade-appropriate language, using similar structure, and with no overlap between answer option image descriptions does the item not contain visual bias. 

b.       Example:

[]

A.      Alt text: A shape with a flat square bottom, a flat square top, and 4 flat square sides.

B.      Alt text: A shape with a round flat bottom, a round flat top, and one curved side.

C.      Alt text: A shape that is round with one curved side, like a ball.

D.      Alt text: A shape with a flat triangle bottom and 3 sides that connect at a top point.

2.       Calculation with 3-D shapes

a.       State name of the shape, and then give more detailed information (measurements and labels). 

b.       Make sure the student has all the information needed to solve the problem.

c.       Spell out the abbreviated measurements if they don’t appear in other parts of the item. d. Example:

[]

Alt text: The sandbox is in the shape of a rectangular prism. It is 3.4 m long and 2.5 m wide.

Line and Angle Relationships 

a.             Describe each parallel line and the angles created by the intersecting line(s), starting with the upper left angle and moving in a clockwise direction. 

b.             Use “blank” to describe the angles that are not labeled in the image.

c.             Use your best judgment to determine when the description is too complex or lengthy for a nonsighted student to access. If it is, the image/item should be marked as having visual bias.

d.             Example:

[]

Alt text: A diagram. Longdesc: On line m where it intersects line k, 4 angles are created. Labeled clockwise, from upper left: angle 1, blank, angle 3, angle 2. On line n where it intersects line k, 4 angles are created. Labeled clockwise, from upper left: angle 4, angle 5, angle 6, blank.

Fractions (Represented by Shaded Parts of a Shape)

a.             Describe the shape.

b.             Describe how the shape is divided.

[]

A.      Alt text: A circle is divided into 5 equal parts. 1 part is shaded. 

B.      Alt text: A circle is divided into 4 equal parts. 1 part is shaded. C. Alt text: A circle is divided into 3 equal parts. 1 part is shaded. D. Alt text: A circle is divided into 2 equal parts. 1 part is shaded.

Groups and Patterns

Groups 

a.             For consistency, use the same categories and descriptions from the answer choices in the description, providing they don’t cue the answer.

b.             Use a bulleted list for student-controlled navigation. 

c.             Example:

[]

Alt text: Two groups of objects. Longdesc:

| •       1 large, red and white striped sock.   | •       1 large solid white sock.     |
|                                                |                                       |
| •       1 small, red and white striped sock.   | •       1 small solid white sock.     |
+------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+

b.       Remain consistent in word choice within the item and, ideally, with similar items in your assessment bank. 

c.       Describe the aspects of the pattern that are necessary to select the answer. In the example below, there is no need to describe the dots or the color of the dots; only the number is given.

d.       Example:

[]

Alt text: Four groups of dots are shown in a pattern: 8, 6, 4, 2. 

2.       Linear patterns

a.       For long patterns of simple shapes or objects, like fruit, list single shapes without a number and more than one shape in a row with a number. This reduces the cognitive load and helps students focus on the pattern.

Alt text: A picture. Longdesc: The picture shows a crayon measured with a centimeter ruler with marks showing each tenth of a centimeter. The crayon begins at 2 centimeters and ends at 9 centimeters.

Spinners 

a.             Describe how many parts the spinner is divided into and if parts are equal or unequal.

b.             List different parts, if necessary to answering the question. If pieces are unequal, list from largest to smallest.

c.              Remember: You do not need to repeat information given in the setup language of the item. However, sometimes it is helpful to the student to have all of the description of the image together in the alt tag.

d.             Example with equal-sized pieces:  

[]

(In this example, the image description repeats some information given in the text outside the image in order to keep the pertinent information for answering the question together.) Alt text: The spinner is divided into 5 equal sections. 1 section is green. 

e.             Example with unequal-sized pieces:

[]

Alt text: A spinner. Longdesc: A spinner is divided into 5 unequal parts labeled 1 through 5.

From largest to smallest: 

•       5, which takes up almost half the spinner.

•       3, which is a little more than a quarter of the spinner.

•       1 and 2, which are equal and each take up about one-eighth of the spinner.

•       4, which is a little smaller than 1 and 2.

Thermometers

a.             Set up the thermometer by providing the range of numbers, the units, and the intervals. 

b.             Describe the temperature level by saying at which mark the liquid in the thermometer stops.  c.          Example:

[]

Alt text: The thermometer shows temperatures from 0 degrees to 25 degrees Celsius (C). Marks show every 5 degrees. The red liquid stops at 15 degrees.

Venn Diagrams

Double 

a.             Focus on the data in the Venn diagram, not on the appearance.

b.             List the contents of each circle and then the area of intersection, using narrative description.

c.             For lower grade levels, we may want to describe the diagram as “two overlapping circles.”

d.             Provide the data in brief statements.

e.             Illustrations included in the Venn diagram are often decorative and rarely need to be described.

f.              Example:

[]

Alt text: The diagram shows 2 overlapping circles labeled Crayons and Markers. Crayons has 4. Markers has 7. The area of overlap has 18.

Triple 

a.             Consider the grade level of the item to determine how much interpretation is necessary to include in the description. This specific example is for 6+. However, the descriptions below show two different levels of description.

b.             List most relevant information first to avoid having the student listen to a long list of information before getting to the answers.

c.             Example (with most interpretation for lower grades):

[]

Alt text: A Venn diagram. Longdesc: The Venn diagram shows the intersections of circles J, K, and L. Some students are in all three classes, some are in two classes, and some are in one class.

Three classes.

•       3 students, Orchestra, Band, and Dance.

Two classes.

•       8 students, Orchestra and Band.

•       15 students, Band and Dance.

•       10 students, Dance and Orchestra.

One class.

•       6 students, Orchestra.

•       12 students, Band.

•       5 students, Dance.

The set has zero students who don’t take performing arts classes.

d.             Example (with less interpretation for higher grade levels):

Alt text: A Venn diagram. Longdesc: The Venn diagram shows the intersection of circles J, K, and L. The set has zero students who don’t take performing arts classes. Some students are in all three classes, some are in two classes, and some are in one class.

•       Intersection of J, K, and L, 3 students.

•       Intersection of J and K, 8 students.

•       Intersection of J and L, 10 students.

•       Intersection of K and L, 15 students.

•       J, 6 students.

•       K, 12 students.

•       L, 5 students.

Universal Sets and Shading 

a.             Focus on the data in the Venn diagram, not on the appearance.

b.             List contents of each circle, and then the area of intersection.

c.             Use narrative description.

d.             For lower grade levels, we may want to describe the diagram as “two overlapping circles.”

e.             Provide the data in brief statements.

f.              If the item is comparing different shading of the same data presented in a Venn diagram, it is unnecessary to give all of the data details for each description. Instead focus on the differences between the images (see example).

[]

A.      Alt text: A Venn diagram. Longdesc: The Venn diagram shows two intersecting circles. Circle S has 105, circle D has 52. The area of intersection has 23. The shaded area is the area of intersection.

B.      Alt text: A Venn diagram. Longdesc: The Venn diagram shows two intersecting circles. Circle S has 105, circle D has 52. The area of intersection has 23. The shaded area is both circles and their area of intersection.

C.      Alt text: A Venn diagram. Longdesc: The Venn diagram shows two intersecting circles. Circle S has 105, circle D has 52. The area of intersection has 23. The shaded area is both circles where they do not intersect.

D.      Alt text: A Venn diagram. Longdesc: The Venn diagram shows two intersecting circles. Circle S has 105, circle D has 52. The area of intersection has 23. The shaded area is the universal set outside the circles.

Visual Bias in Math Item Types

Complexity 

1.       Geoboards

a.       Since geoboards typically show an irregular shape that would require a long and complex description, they are categorized as having visual bias.

b.       Example:

[]

2.       Graphs with three or more curves 

a.       When there are three curves on one graph, the description becomes too long and complicated, with too many numbers and pieces of information to hold in a student’s working memory. These images are categorized as having visual bias.

b.       Example:

[]

Counting Squares for Perimeter/Area 

a.             Many irregular shapes have visual bias when students need to find the perimeter or area, especially when the sides are not labeled with lengths. In those cases, students are expected to count and add squares, which is a visual skill. These items are categorized as having visual bias.

b.             Example:

[]

Number Lines with Equivalent Fractions 

a.      With items of this type, sighted students can quickly find the equivalent fractions by seeing which number line points line up. This gives the sighted student a strong advantage over nonsighted students in answering the question, so these items are categorized as having visual bias.

[]

Rotation 

a.      Item rotation is a visual skill that is not easily accessible to nonsighted students. These items are categorized as having visual bias.

[]

[]

Ruler Items for Which the Item Being Measured Starts at 0 and Ends at a Whole Number 

a.             In these items, the image description would immediately cue the answer (the number at which the item ends), and there is no other effective way to describe the image. For images with objects that end between labeled numbers and needs tick marks in their description (or start at a number other than 0), an image description can be written. 

b.             Example:

[]

1.       3-D figures—Determining a 3-D figure from a net

a.       This item requires an understanding of how a 2-D object transforms into a 3-D object. Since this is a visual exercise, the item has visual bias.

[]

2.       3-D figures—Determining 2-D cross-sections of 3-D figure 

a.       This type of item requires a visual understanding of how a 2-D object transforms into a 3-D object. Since this is a visual exercise, the item has visual bias and should not be described.

b.       Example:

[]

3.       Shapes—Combining to make a new shape

a.       This item type assesses a visual skill, so it is categorized as having visual bias. b. Example:

[]

4.       Shapes—Matching

a.       This type of item asks the student to use visual skills to identify the shape. In the following example, describing the asset shape as a “round clock” and naming each of the shapes would test a different skill (knowing that “round” means a “circle”). Therefore, items of this type have visual bias.

b.       Example:

[]

Visual Comparison 

a.             The visual comparison of the qualities of two objects, such as length, is a sighted skill.

Therefore, items of this type are categorized as having visual bias.

b.             Example:

[]

 

Part 4. Reading and Language Usage

Blanks

a.      When a student needs to fill in information (e.g., the student must choose the answer option that would fit best in the blank), use the term “blank” for the line. You can put commas around the word “blank” to create more of a pause.

[]

Alt text: The sentence is missing a word. It reads: Please, blank, something for Show and Tell. 

Circle/Pie Graphs

a.             Give the title of the graph and describe how it is divided. 

b.             If the graph is divided into unequal parts, describe the parts from largest to smallest using a bullet list.

c.             It is not necessary to describe the colors of the parts unless they are mentioned in other parts of the item.

d.

[]

Alt text: A pie graph. Longdesc: A pie graph entitled John’s January Reading shows five types of reading. In order from greatest amount to smallest amount of time spent reading, the reading types are: 

•       Mysteries.

•       Textbooks.

•       Magazines.

•       Biographies.

•       Cookbooks.

Forms 

Simple Forms 

a.      Describe the area in general by stating that information needs to be given, or describe the blank as a “blank line.”

b.

[]

Dog’s name, blank line. Owner’s name, blank line.

Will the dog sit on command? Yes or No.

Will the dog come when called? Yes or No.

Has the dog had a medical checkup? Yes or No.

Does the dog play well with other dogs? Yes or No. 

Complex Forms 

a.             In instances where the image contains blanks and checkboxes, you may use “provide” when a blank or box needs to be filled out, and “select” when choices have a box next to them to be checked. 

b.             Use the same letter case as shown in the image to indicate the hierarchy of the information.

c.             Use “Start title” and “End title” to ensure student will be able to find the title easily.

d.

[]

Provide:

•       Daytime Telephone Number.

•       E-mail Address.

•       Last Name, First Name, and Middle Initial.

•       Street or Mailing Address and Apartment Number.

•       City, State and Zip Code.

Have you ever worked for the company before? Select Yes or No. If yes, please answer the following questions.

1.       What was your position?

2.       What dates did you hold this position?

3.       Who was your supervisor?

Labeled Sentence Parts

Sentence Parts Labeled for Editing Selection 

a.             Give students the full sentence without any distractions.

b.             Identify the labels. 

c.             Use a list so students can easily navigate from one letter to the next. 

d.

[]

Alt Text: A sentence. Longdesc: Mr. patel teaches spanish, music, and art at my brother’s high school. There are underlined words labeled A through G. 

•       A, patel.

•       B, spanish. 

•       C, music. 

•       D, art. 

•       E, brother’s. 

•       F, high. 

•       G, school.

Blank Spaces Labeled 

a.             Identify the labels first to provide students with context, and then give the sentence. 

b.             When choosing the names for the lines (lines, blanks, spaces), remain consistent with the language used in the rest of the item. In the example below, “space” is used to be consistent with the language in the answer options.

[]

Alt text: A sentence with spaces labeled A, B, and C mixed in with the words. The sentence is:

Space A rolled Space B across the street Space C.

Passages with Images 

A description of a passage image might already be embedded within the passage text. Use your best judgment to avoid repeating information or to determine that the information should be repeated in the image description for fairness (e.g., if the description of the image appears scattered throughout the passage, it might be better to consolidate the information in one place in the image description to give a similar experience as a sighted student would have in seeing the image).

Picture (Photo or Illustration) 

a.             Give a brief description of the image. The level of detail necessary will depend on the passage and item. An item that directs students toward the image or asks the student to compare information found in the passage and the image will require greater detail in the image description. 

b.             State the caption if one accompanies the image. It is not necessary to restate the credit for the image.

[]

Alt text: Photo: A picture of a dog. Caption: Abraham Lincoln and his family owned a pet dog while they lived in Springfield. Fido, a retriever/shepherd mix, lived with the Lincolns until they left for Washington, D.C. Fido remained in Springfield with family friends. Lincoln Home National Historic Site, Illinois.

        d.      Example:

[]

Alt text: A photo and a caption. Longdesc: The photo shows a scoop of ice cream in an ice cream cone. The caption reads: Today, ice cream is often served in a cone.

Sidebar 

a.             Give the title of the sidebar using “Title” and “End title.”

b.             Give the full text of the sidebar and describe any images which may appear in it if they are not purely decorative.

c.

[]

Alt text: A sidebar. Longdesc: Title. Make Your Own Pineapple Sorbet! End title. 

•       1 pound frozen pineapple chunks.

•       1 cup water.

•       1 cup coconut milk or cream.

•       Honey to taste.

Blend all ingredients and freeze.

Sentence Corrections 

Edited sentences can be described in a number of ways, depending on what the edits are. Use your best judgment to determine the description that is easiest to understand.

a.             It may make more sense to describe the original sentence, read without the edits, and then read the edited sentence. Example:

[]

A.      Alt text: Original sentence: The family brought their dogs to to the park. Edited sentence: The family brought their dogs to the park.

B.      Alt text: Original sentence: The family brought their four dogs to the park. Edited sentence: The family brought their three dogs to the park.

C.      Alt text: Original sentence: The family brought their dogs to the park. Edited sentence: The family brought their dogs to the neighborhood park.

D.      Alt text: Original sentence: The family brought their dogs to the park. Edited sentence: The family brings their dogs to the park.

b.             When the stem or other part of the item calls out the specific editing that has been performed (in the example below, “the word crossed out” is stated in the stem), describe the editing in addition to the original sentence and the edited sentence. Example:

[]

Alt Text: An edited sentence. Original sentence: Hopefully, I will see ya later. The word ya is crossed out and you is written above it. Edited sentence: Hopefully, I will see you later.

Sequence of Events Charts (Plot Diagrams) 

a.             Use a numbered list for the separate events. 

b.             Use language consistent with the stem (in the example item, we use the term “box” because it appears in the item).

c.

[]

(Note: This item’s passage of “The Three Little Pigs” has been omitted from the screenshot.) Alt text: 4 boxes. Longdesc:

•       Box 1. The three pigs begin building their houses. 

•       Box 2. The wolf blows down the straw house. 

•       Box 3. The wolf blows down the stick house. 

•       Box 4. Empty.

Timelines

a.             Give title if one appears.

b.             Use a bullet list to show events on the timeline. 

c.             Ignore illustrations unless they provide additional necessary information or are mentioned in other parts of the item. 

d.

[]

•       1045, moveable-type printing.

•       1182, magnetic compass.

•       1268 to 1289, eyeglasses.

•       1295, modern glassmaking.

•       1328, sawmill.

•       1366, scales for weighing. 

Venn Diagrams

a.             Focus on the data in the Venn diagram, not on its appearance.

b.             List the contents of each circle and then the area of intersection using a narrative description.

c.             For lower grade levels, we may want to describe the diagram as “two overlapping circles.”

d.             Provide the data in brief statements.

e.             Avoid describing purely decorative images.

f.

[]

Alt text: A Venn diagram. Longdesc: The Venn diagram has two intersecting circles. One circle is labeled Great Horned Owls. The other circle is labeled Robins.  

•       Circle 1, Great Horned Owls: eat mice and rats, hooked beak, use other birds’ nests.

•       Circle 2, Robins: eat seeds and insects, build nests.

•       Area of Intersection: lay eggs, care for young.

Webs (Word/Association)

a.             Describe the center circle and give the number of connections.

b.             Describe the surrounding circles. If there are many connected circles, it may be best to use a bullet list to describe them.

c.

[]

Alt text: A chart. Longdesc: The chart shows a web with center circle, Maggie, connected to four labels: spends summer at the farm, learns to milk the cow, meets Betsy from next door, goes fishing with Grandpa.

Visual Bias in Reading and Language Usage Item Types

Using a Picture to Choose the Correct Preposition 

These items often have visual bias because the language needed to describe the image usually contains the preposition being tested, cuing the key.

[]

Identifying Uppercase or Lowercase Letters 

Screen readers don’t usually describe the case of the letters being read, so a student relying on a screen reader would be unable to answer a question of this type when the letters are plain text. If

the letters are images, any effective description would contain the words “uppercase” or “lowercase,” cuing the key. Therefore, these items are categorized as having visual bias.

Example:

[]

Part 5. Science

Where element symbols, equations, scientific labels, etc. appear in the example item text, a tool was used to ensure that these would be read as optimally as possible. For example, we used a tool to ensure that the element symbol “Au” in the text of an answer option would be read by screen readers as “Upper A u.” While the text may appear different, the language in the image descriptions given here is consistent with how screen readers will read the text in other parts of each item. 

Chemical Elements

When to Use the Element Symbol 

a.             When an item uses the element symbol in other parts of the item, then the image description should also use the element symbol. 

b.             When writing the element symbol, you may choose to use a space between the letters of the symbol to allow for better screen reader behavior. In addition, you may choose to highlight the upper and/or lowercase letters of the symbol. Keep consistency in mind when making this choice to ensure that what a student hears in the image description matches what he or she will hear when the rest of the item is read. 

c.             Example:

(Note: In the example below, not all of the elements in the periodic table are described. For more information about describing periodic tables, please see the Periodic Tables section.)

[]

Alt text: A periodic table. Longdesc: The first four rows of the periodic table are shown. The following elements are included.

  ----------------- -------- ------- --------------- -------------------

When to Use the Element Name  

a.             When the element name appears in other parts of the item, or when the symbol appears only in the image, use the element name. You may also decide to include the symbol after the name.

b.             Example:

(Note: In the example below, not all of the elements in the periodic table are described. For more information about describing periodic tables, please see the Periodic Tables section.)

a.             Provide a general description to introduce the number of models and their labels. 

b.             Describe the energy levels, working from the outside toward the interior. 

c.             Describe the contents of the center.

d.             Use the term energy level (not shell) to refer to the outer rings, and use the term center (not nucleus) to refer to the interior, except when shell or nucleus is used elsewhere in the item.

e.             Use the terms negative sign, positive sign, and empty circle when there is no key identifying what these symbols mean. If the model uses letters (E, P, N) use these letters in the image description unless the full words (proton, electron, neutron) are used elsewhere in the item (at which point you may choose to use the full word in the image description as well). f.   Example:

[]

b.             State what each cluster contains, starting with the middle atom and moving around the cluster in a clockwise direction. For a chain, move from left to right. 

c.             Depending on how the elements are referenced in other parts of the item, use the element symbol or the full name. 

d.             Describe the valence electrons as “electrons.”

e.             Describe the dots as shared pairs or lone pairs to distinguish whether they are shared with another element.

[]

A.      Alt text: A Lewis structure. Longdesc: The Lewis structure shows a chain of atoms: Upper C l, Upper H, Upper C l, Upper C, Upper C l. There is a pair of shared electrons between each atom. The first Upper C l and the last Upper C l each have one lone pair of electrons.

Upper C has three additional lone pairs of electrons. The middle two Upper C l atoms each have two lone pairs of electrons. The last Upper C l has three lone pairs of electrons.

Orbital Notation / Electron Configuration  

a.             Provide an overview to let students know there are boxes and arrows, and to point out how many boxes each S and P will always have.

b.             Describe what each box contains, using a bulleted list. To be more succinct, use the terms up and down (instead of “arrow pointing up/down”).

c.             If multiple boxes are associated with a letter, preface each box contents with a box number (e.g., Box 1, Box 2, etc.).

[]

Asset: Alt text: An electron configuration. Longdesc: The electron configuration is an orbital diagram with boxes and arrows. Each S has one box, and each P has three boxes. 

•       1 S. 1 up, 1 down.  •   2 S. 1 up, 1 down. 

•       2 P. Box 1, 1 up, 1 down. Box 2, 1 up. Box 3, 1 up.

(See Lewis dot structure section for more information on how to describe the answer options for this item.)

Structural Formula 

a.             When a structural formula is linear, 

i.         Refer to the elements from left to right. 

ii.       Use the symbol instead of the full name of the element.

b.             When a structural formula is clustered, 

i.         Reference the element in the middle first, and then move from left to right to describe the elements around it OR move in a clockwise direction to describe the elements around it.

Choose the pattern that presents the information as clearly and concisely as possible. 

ii.       Use the symbol instead of the full name of the element.

c.              When a structural formula is a ring, 

i.         Describe the overall shape of the structure.  ii. Describe the details of the structure, starting with the ring and then moving left to right or clockwise, depending on what is clearest within the item.

iii. When referencing the elements of the ring, use the element name and the element symbol for clarity.

d.             Describe the bonds as “shares a single/double/triple bond with.”

e.             Keep in mind that you may not need to describe every detail of the structure. This depends on the skill being assessed in the item. Be as concise as possible within the context of the item.

f.               Example with clustered and linear elements:

[]

Alt text: A diagram. Longdesc: The diagram shows 3 compounds:

•       Upper C Upper H shares single bonds with Upper C Upper H 3, Upper C Upper H 3, and Upper O Upper H.

•       Upper C Upper H 3 shares a single bond with Upper C Upper H2, which shares a single bond with Upper O Upper H. 

•       Upper C Upper H 2 shares a single bond with Upper C Upper H 2. Each Upper C Upper H 2 shares a single bond with a different Upper O Upper H.

g.             Example with ring structure:

[]

Alt text: A diagram of a molecule. Longdesc: The molecule has a main ring with two long chains. The ring has six carbon (Upper C) whose bonds alternate between single bonds and double bonds. 4 of the carbons share a single bond with an Upper H, for a total of 4 Upper H coming off the ring. Two chains attach to the ring at the 2 remaining Upper C, who share a double bond. Those chains are:

•       Ring’s Upper C shares a single bond with Upper C, which shares a double bond with Upper O and a single bond with a second Upper O. The second Upper O shares a single bond with Upper H.

•       Ring’s second Upper C shares a single bond with Upper O, which shares a single bond with an Upper C. This Upper C shares a double bond with an Upper O and a single bond with Upper C Upper H 3.

Structural Formula of Macromolecules 

a.             Focus on the atoms, chains, and number of each atom to help students differentiate one macromolecule from another.

b.             Describe the links and units instead of leading students with a term like fatty acids.

The cycle shows these stages: eggs, a caterpillar or larva, a chrysalis, a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis, and a butterfly. An arrow points from the butterfly back to the eggs.

(Note: Usually, it is not necessary to refer back to the first stage of the cycle at the end of the description; however, in this item, the stem calls out the arrow between two specific stages, so it is helpful to refer to that arrow at the end of the longdesc.)

Water Cycle 

a.             Provide a setup of the image if the text surrounding the image does not already do so.

b.             Describe a lettered cycle in alphabetical order.

c.             If an item is not assessing a student’s knowledge of the names of each stage in the cycle, include the stage names in the description along with a description of what is physically happening.

•       E: Water condensing inside a cloud.

Diagrams

When describing diagrams, it is important to consider the skill being assessed and the language used in other parts of the item to determine what information needs to be in the image description. Often, you don’t need to describe every detail of the diagram. By focusing on the similarities and differences, or the change between parts of the diagram, you can communicate the information necessary to make the item accessible.

Biology—Cell Structure 

a.             Cell images may have visual bias. It depends on the context of the question. Each cell diagram should be considered individually. Images that require a student to identify cell parts often have visual bias because the amount of detail needed to describe the different parts leads to cognitive overload.

b.             When a cell structure item does not have visual bias, describe the labeled parts of the image.

It is usually not necessary to describe the diagram in detail.

c.             Example:

[]

Alt text: Four parts of the cell are labeled: cell wall, chloroplast, vacuole, and nucleus.

(Note: A description of the graph is not shown here, as it is a separate image and would require a separate description. Go to the Science section for Graphs for more information.)

Geology

Faults 

a.             Set up the description by giving a general overview of the picture if an overview hasn’t already been given by preceding text. 

b.             Describe the fault planes as inclined or vertical.

c.             If arrows are shown in the diagram to indicate the movement of the plates, use the terms up and down to describe them.

d.

[]

Alt text: Three diagrams. Longdesc: The diagrams show three basic fault types. 

•       Diagram A: Two plates shift past each other along an inclined fault plane. One side of the fault plane moves down. 

•       Diagram B: Two plates shift past each other along an inclined fault plane. One side of the fault plane moves up. 

•       Diagram C: Two plates shift past each other horizontally along a vertical fault plane.

Graphic Plates 

a.             Set up the description by giving a general overview of the picture if an overview hasn’t already been given by preceding text.

b.             Use terminology that appears in other parts of the item. Pay particular attention to language in answer options so no answer option is immediately recognizable as a distractor just because the image description did not include terminology from that answer option.

c.

[]

Alt text: A diagram. Longdesc: The diagram shows the Oceanic crust and the Continental crust meeting at a coast. The Oceanic crust extends beneath the Continental crust. Arrows indicate that the Oceanic crust and the Continental crust are moving toward each other. A trench is shown in the water above where the two crusts meet. On land, a coastal mountain range is located in the Continental crust. A volcano is pictured in the coastal range, with magma extending down from the tip of its cone, through the Continental crust, to the Oceanic crust beneath.

Fossils 

a.             Begin with “The fossil shows . . .” if the word fossil is mentioned in the item.

b.             Describe the shape or the distinguishing parts of the skeleton that are pictured in the fossil. The level of detail necessary for the description will vary based on the context of the item.

c.             If the item asks a student to match an image to an imprint (the images in the answer options are identical to the imprint of the fossil), the item may have visual bias. Also, if the image cannot be described in such a way as to eliminate all but one answer option, then the item should be categorized as having visual bias.

d.             Example:  

[]

Alt text: The fossil shows a small skeleton with a head, a thin body, legs, and a tail.

Layers 

a.             Provide a setup for the layers. If available, use the information in the stem to set up the image. 

b.             List the layers shown in the picture or diagram, starting at the surface and moving down. 

c.             Describe only the aspects of the diagram that are needed to understand and answer the item using the skills being assessed by the item. If the physical features of each layer are not needed for the skill being assessed, you may not want to describe them to avoid cognitive overload. 

d.             If reading the key is not the skill being assessed by the item, you may want to interpret the key/image for the student to reduce the cognitive load. 

e.             Example:

[]

Alt text: A diagram. Longdesc: The diagram shows a cross section view of rock layers beneath Earth’s surface. The layers are split by a vertical fault, labeled 7, and the layers on either side of the fault line do not align. The two sides are labeled Side A and Side B.

•       12, shale.

•       8, granite, is a mound-like clump that intrudes the bottom undefined layer and then layers 12, 11, and 10.

Graphs (Line) 

Science graphs may be treated differently from math graphs since the items often assess an understanding of a conceptual trend rather than how to read data on a graph.  

a.             Provide a setup for the graph, giving the labels for the x- and y-axes if shown.

b.             Describe the overall shape of the line by using general terms such as increases, decreases, curves, and starts to level off.

c.             If data points are shown, describe the data. Use a range if the data is not precise.

d.             Example without data points:

[]

Asset: Alt text: A diagram. Longdesc: The diagram shows how long ago rock layers were formed and fossil types found in the rock layers:

•       50 million years ago. Plants on land.

•       100 million years ago. Plants in shallow sea.

•       150 million years ago. Plants in deep sea.

•       200 million years ago. Plants in shallow sea.

•       250 million years ago. Plants in deep sea.

Answer options:

A.      Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: The graph shows Sea Level in meters and millions of years ago. As millions of years ago increases, sea level rises from nearly zero, falls a little, and then rises again. 

B.      Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: The graph shows Sea Level in meters and millions of years ago. As millions of years ago increases, sea level rises from nearly zero, reaches a peak, and then falls to nearly zero again.

C.      Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: The graph shows Sea Level in meters and millions of years ago. As millions of years ago increases, sea level rises from nearly zero, falls a little, rises again, and then falls to nearly zero again.

D.      Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: The graph shows Sea Level in meters and millions of years ago. As millions of years ago increases, sea level begins high, falls dramatically, and then rises again.

E.       Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: The graph shows Sea Level in meters and millions of years ago. As millions of years ago increases, sea level begins low and rises steadily. 

e.             Example with data points:

[]

Alt text: A graph. Longdesc: The line graph shows the x-axis is labeled Time in hours. The y-axis is labeled Blood Glucose Level in milligrams glucose per 100 milliliters blood. The line starts at zero hours at 100 blood glucose level, decreases slowly, and then begins to level off.

•       0 hours, 100 blood glucose level.

•       1 hour, about 95 blood glucose level.

•       2 hours, about 90 blood glucose level.

•       3 hours, 80 blood glucose level. 

•       4 hours, about 70 blood glucose level.

•       5 hours, about 65 blood glucose level. 

•       6 hours, 60 blood glucose level.

(Note: A description of the flowchart is not shown here, as it is a separate image and would require a separate description. Go to the section for Flowcharts for more information.)

Maps

a.             Provide a general description of the map. 

b.             Describe the key, if one is present.

c.              Drill down into the details of the image, using subject-specific vocabulary (e.g., latitude, longitude). You may want to focus on the idea being conveyed with the image (in the following example, current and wind direction) instead of giving all of the details of the map’s appearance.

d.             When a compass is pictured on the map, you may use these directions to help specify details on the map. 

e.             Keep language consistent with language in other parts of the item.

f.               Example when reading the key is not the skill being assessed:

[]

(Note: In this case, the information conveyed by the map can be summarized instead of focusing on the colors from the key (making the connection for the student).)

Alt text: A map. Longdesc: In South America, Peru is on the west coast and Brazil is on the east coast. Below the equator on the Brazilian coast, warm ocean currents flow south, and prevailing winds blow from east to west in Brazil. Below the equator on the Peruvian coast, warm and cold ocean currents flow north.

g.             Example when reading the key is the skill being assessed:

[]

(Note: Since reading and understanding the key is the skill being assessed, describe the colors on the map instead of giving the data conveyed by the colors in the key (allowing the student to make the connection).)

Alt text: A map. Longdesc: The map is entitled Land Elevations in Florida. It shows a key of land elevations by color. Red is below 1.5 meters, blue is 1.5 to 3.5 meters, yellow is above 3.5 meters. 

•       Northern Florida is mostly yellow. 

•       Southern Florida is mostly red with some blue around the red. 

•       Eastern Florida is mostly yellow with some of the coastline dotted in blue and red. 

•       Western Florida is mostly yellow with most of the coast lined in blue.

Periodic Tables

a.            Provide a brief introduction that tells students the whole table is shown, but describe in detail only the elements that are highlighted or given in the answer choices, stem, or asset.  i.    Use a table for easy navigation when describing three or more elements. 

ii.       Write the description as a narrative if only one or two elements from the periodic table are described. 

iii.     When describing a single element in a square (not in a full periodic table), list the numbers and identify what the numbers represent. A table format (instead of a list) is easier to navigate. 

b.            When referring to the elements, use the full name or the symbol, maintaining consistency with the rest of the item (do not use the full name of the element if only the symbol is used in the rest of the item). Use Element Symbol for a table header when using only the symbol. Use Element (Symbol) for the header when using the element name. For more information about when to use the symbol and when to use the full name of chemical elements, please see the Chemical Elements section.

c.             Identify what the numbers are in the periodic table if doing so will not affect the construct being assessed. When in doubt, consult a content specialist.

d.            When describing elements, use the order in which they appear in the answer options. 

i.         If an element is highlighted in the periodic table, begin with that element description and then move on to the order in which they appear in the answer options. 

ii.       If elements appear in multiple answer options (in various combinations), use the period order number.

iii.     If elements are not in the answer options, use the period number order.

e.            Example:

[]

Pyramids and Webs

Pyramid 

a.             Provide a general description of the pyramid, giving title and number of levels.

b.             Use a bullet list, describe the details of the levels, starting from the bottom and moving up.

c.             The level of detail in the description of the pyramid levels depends on the context of the item.

Describe only what is necessary to the item.

[]

Alt text: An ecological pyramid. Longdesc: The pyramid is titled Marine Ecosystem Energy Pyramid, and it shows four levels. From the base to the peak, the levels are:

•       Level 1, 1000 units.

•       Level 2, 100 units.

•       Level 3, 10 units.

•       Level 4, 1 unit.

(Note: This item assesses understanding of the law of conservation of energy, so it is important to describe the amount of energy, but it is unnecessary to describe the images/organisms in each level.)  

Webs and Chains 

a.             Focus on the relationship between the organisms instead of the diagram’s structure.

b.             Use a list to organize the information and approach the food web from the top (the organism not consumed by others). 

c.             Alternatively, for food chains (organisms in a row, separated by arrows), use language like “from” and “to.” For example, “The arrows point from the grasses, to the marmot, and from the marmot to the grizzly bear.” 

d.             Additional description may be needed to help visually impaired students understand abovegrade or specialized terms—knowledge that sighted students might access by seeing the image. This additional information is acceptable as long as knowledge of those terms is not the construct being assessed.

Alt text: A food web. Longdesc:

•       Alligator consumes Great blue heron (bird), Carp (fish), and Mud turtle. 

•       Great blue heron consumes Carp. 

•       Carp consumes Mosquito and Bladderwort (plant). 

•       Mud turtle consumes Bladderwort. 

•       Mosquito consumes Butterfly orchid (plant). 

(Note: Additional description was given to some of the organisms (identifying a heron as a bird, carp as a fish, and bladderwort and butterfly orchid as plants). Without such verbal identification, visually impaired students may not know what these species are, and visually aided students would have an unfair advantage.)

Visual Bias in Science Item Types

Many of the Science items with visual bias that you will encounter will be due to complexity. If the image needs so much description that a student would be unable to keep track of the information presented in the description, or if the description requires language too complex for the level being assessed, the image has visual bias. 

Example:

[]

This image is deceptively simple in design. Describing the labeled parts’ appearance in enough detail to allow a student to differentiate between parts would lead to a cognitive overload and possibly incorporate vocabulary above grade level. In addition, describing the labeled parts by name would cue the answer. Therefore, this image would be classified as having visual bias.
