Introduction
Templates and document production processes can automate many aspects of accessibility, but the range of necessary checkpoints is extensive and human judgment is required in many areas.
Organizations committed to providing accessible electronic documents require a costeffective means of ensuring their document's accessibility features are adequate.
Intended for software developers and document testers, the Matterhorn Protocol is designed to foster PDF/UA adoption by specifying a common set of tests to facilitate the exchange of detailed information on PDF/UA conformance.
NOTE: The concepts of "partial conformance" and "severity of non-conformance" are intentionally not addressed in this document.

PDF is the electronic document format found worldwide in every corner of almost every organization that uses computers. The value of PDF may be stated in terms of the capacity to deliver a stable and trustworthy representation of a document.
Accordingly, PDF implementers have a special responsibility to ensure reliability and consistency by following clear, specific and detailed industry and normative standards in the development of PDF creation, modification and viewing software.
About PDF/UA
Ensuring content is accessible to users with disabilities presents broad and complex challenges in any technology. ISO 14289-1 (PDF/UA-1) specifies technical requirements for PDF files to ensure a highquality and consistent reading experience when used by a variety of PDF/UA-conforming processors.
Matterhorn Protocol Checkpoints
The Matterhorn Protocol is a set of 31 checkpoints comprised of 136 failure conditions encompassing file format requirements specified in PDF/UA-1. 87 failure conditions can be determined by software alone, 47 failure conditions usually require human judgment. 2 failure conditions have no specific tests (23-001 and 27-001). Some failure conditions pertain to the document, some to the page and most to individual objects such as tags, tables or annotations.
Key to the Headers in the Failure Conditions Tables
IndexA numerical identifier for individual failure conditions within a given Checkpoint.Failure 
ConditionNon-conforming condition present in the PDF file.
NOTE: Pathological software behavior (such as "flickering" by using a script to cause animation effects via a series of actions) is not addressed.SectionA reference to the relevant section in PDF/UA on a paragraph level. "UA1" refers to the 
PDF/UA-1 standard. The point-separated numbers after the colon refer to a clause in PDF/UA-1.  
The digits following the hyphen identify a specific paragraph within the clause.TypeThe nature of the tested item. Possible values are Doc for aspects of the document as a whole, Page for pages inside the document, Object for individual data objects, JS for JavaScript embedded in the document and All where all aspects of the document are affected.HowWhile not determinative the value of "How" generally indicates the realistic best-practice approach at the present time. Some checkpoints may always be decided by M (Machine), some usually or probably require H (Human) interaction.SeeCertain failure conditions are covered in full by other failure conditions. Such cases are indicated by an index reference in this column.Additional Reading

PDF/UA-1 Failure Conditions
Checkpoint 01: Real content tagged
IndexFailure ConditionSectionTypeHowSee01-001Artifact is tagged as real content.UA1:7.1-1ObjectH-01-002Real content is marked as artifact.UA1:7.1-1ObjectH-01-003Content marked as Artifact is present inside tagged content.UA1:7.1-1ObjectM-01-004Tagged content is present inside content marked as Artifact.UA1:7.1-1ObjectM-01-005Content is neither marked as Artifact nor tagged as real content.UA1:7.1-2ObjectM-01-006The structure type and attributes of a structure element are not semantically appropriate for the structure element. All of the following structure types must be taken into account:
<Document>, <Part>, <Art>, <Sect>, <Div>, <BlockQuote>, 
<Caption>, <TOC>, <TOCI>, <Index>, <NonStruct>, <Private>, 
<P>, <H>, <H1>, <H2>, <H3>, <H4>, <H5>, <H6>, <L>, <LI>, <Lbl>, 
<LBody>, <Table>, <TR>, <TH>, <TD>, <THead>, <TBody, <TFoot, 
<Span>, <Quote>, <Note>, <Reference>, <BibEntry>, <Code>, <Link>, <Annot>, <Ruby>, <Warichu>, <RB>, <RT>, <RP>, <WT>, <WP>, <Figure>, <Formula>, <Form>.
NOTE 1: Structure type is not semantically appropriate if the nature of the content inside the structure element does not match the structure type of the structure element. 
NOTE 2: For any non-standard structure types, the standard structure type to which the type is role-mapped shall be used for validation.
NOTE 3: Tables are regular when the number of logical cells is equal in each row after accounting for RowSpan and ColSpan attributes.
While PDF/UA-1 does not prohibit irregular tables, irregular tables are almost always a strong indicator of improper table structure. It may be a good idea to raise a warning when such tables are encountered, but it is not required by the Matterhorn Protocol.
NOTE 4: The value of table cell attributes is a function of the cell's semantic role in the table's structure. Therefore, a <TH> cell may not include a Scope attribute with an inappropriate value.UA1:7.1-2ObjectH-01-007Suspects entry has a value of true.UA1:7.1-11DocM-Checkpoint 02: Role Mapping
IndexFailure ConditionSectionTypeHowSee02-001One or more non-standard tag's mapping does not terminate with a standard type.
NOTE: Although PDF/UA defines the nomenclature for heading levels above <H6> (<Hn>), these are not standard structure types (as defined in ISO 32000-1) and therefore <Hn> tags must (PDF/UA-1 7.1, paragraph 1) be role-mapped to a standard structure type. According to PDF/UA-1, PDF/UA-conforming processors are expected to ignore such mappings and respect the heading level.UA1:7.1-3DocM-02-002The mapping of one or more non-standard types is semantically inappropriate.UA1:7.1-3DocH-02-003A circular mapping existsUA1:7.1-3DocM-02-004One or more standard types are remapped.UA1:7.1-4DocM-NOTE: All Failure Conditions in Checkpoint 02 apply to entries in the role map dictionary regardless of whether a given tag is used in the structure tree or not.
