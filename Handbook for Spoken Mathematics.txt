Handbook for

Spoken mathematics

SECTION 1 — INTRODUCTION

This handbook answers some of the needs of the many people who have to deal with spoken mathematics, yet have insufficient background to know the correct verbal expression for the written symbolic one. Mathematical material is primarily presented visually, and when this material is presented orally, it can be ambiguous. While the parsing of a written expression is clear and well-defined, when it is spoken this clarity may disappear. For example, "One plus two over three plus four" can represent the following four numbers, depending on the parsing of the expression: 3/7, 1 2/7, 5, 5 2/3. However, when the corresponding written expression is seen, there is little doubt which of the four numbers it represents. When reading mathematics orally, such problems are frequently encountered. Of course, the written expression may always be read symbol by symbol, but if the expression is long or there are a cluster of expressions, it can be very tedious and hard to understand. Thus, whenever possible, one wishes to have the written expression spoken in a way that is interest retaining and easy to understand.

In an attempt to alleviate problems such as these, this handbook has been compiled to establish some consistent and well-defined ways of uttering mathematical expressions so that listeners will receive clear, unambiguous, and well-pronounced representations of the subject.

Some of the people who will benefit from this handbook are: 1) those who read mathematics orally and have insufficient background in the subject, and their listeners; 2) those interested in voice synthesis for the computer, particularly those who deal. with spoken symbolic expressions; and 3) those technical writers and transcribers who may need to verbalize mathematics.

This edition of the handbook is a working one, and it is hoped that the people who use it will add to and refine it. The choice of material and its ordering are my own preferences, and, as such, they reflect my biases. A goal of the handbook is to establish a standard where no standard has existed, so far as [ know. However, this standard represents only one of many possibilities. As a blind person, I have learned mathematics by means of others reading the material to me; so my preferences are a result of direct experience.

This handbook is organized as follows: In Section Il the various types of alphabets used in mathematics are listed. Section (I! lists the basic symbols used in mathematics, along with their verbalizations. Sections IV—Xi list the expressions used in some of the more common branches of mathematics, along with their verbalizations. Section XII contains some suggestions on how to and how not to describe diagrams.

To use this handbook efficiently, it is suggested that you look over Sections Il and Ill on alphabets and basic symbols. Next, establish which section most closely relates to the subject matter at hand. There may also be material in other sections that you can use if you cannot find what you need in the related section. In many sections, more than one choice for a given expression is offered to the user. Once the choice has been made. the reader should use it consistently throughout the text. If you encounter an expression that is not included in the guide, read the expression literally, that is, read it from left to right, symbol by symbol.

For those who are interested in speech synthesis and speech recognition for the computer, this handbook may provide some basic ideas and suggestions regarding the formulation of spoken mathematics. With speech synthesis, when the computer reads a file containing many mathematical expressions, the speech synthesizer will speak the expressions symbol by symbol. As we have pointed out before, this process can be tedious and hard to understand. A program that could translate the mathematical expressions from the symbol to symbol form into a spoken form that is more intelligible can ease the task for those who use synthetic speech. On the other hand, if one wishes to communicate mathematical expressions to the computer by voice, a program that will translate spoken expressions of mathematics into written expressions with the correct parsing is essential. This handbook provides a basis for writing these programs, both for speech synthesis and voice recognition, by giving examples of written mathematical expressions followed by the word for word spoken form of the same expressions. An example where these ideas are of particular relevance is the voice input and output of computer programs that manipulate symbolic expressions, because both the input and output of the program are mathematical expressions.

I would like to thank the Office of Equal Opportunity of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for their support in bringing this handbook into fruition. Thanks also go to my wife for her untiring help and to my friends and colleagues at the Lab for their assistance.

SECTION Xll — DIAGRAMS AND GRAPHS

In this section the approach changes from previous sections. Here suggestions are merely offered to alleviate the very complicated problem of diagram description.

Diagrams are visual aids and are very useful to illustrate qualitative information. Because of their visual nature, it is somewhat clumsy and sometimes even impossible to describe them verbally. The old saying, "A picture is worth a thousand words", sums up the difficulty faced when trying to describe a picture with words. The degree of complexity of the diagram should determine whether "reading" the diagram is worth the effort. Some illustrations require so many words from the reader that it can render the listener in a state of depressed confusion from which there is no reasonable hope of bringing him out clear-headed again.

This section deals mainly with suggestions for describing diagrams in general. These suggestions should help the interpreter convey the information in the illustration to the listener in as clear a manner as possible. [t is most important that diagrams be described clearly. A poorly read diagram is worse than one not read at all, because it can confuse and frustrate the listener and even give misleading information. When taping, if the reader finds that the material to be described is not clear or comprehensible to himself, the reader should consult the listener in person. Specific questions from the listener will likely elicit the desired information. If the listener is blind, there are other ways to facilitate understanding of the diagram, such as tracing the diagram using the blind person's hand, or using raised line drawing paper to duplicate the essential parts.

The following are some specific suggestions that I have personally found helpful when having diagrams read to me. First, read the caption, for it may contain a very good description of the diagram itself. Next, describe the shapes either contained in the diagram or comprising the entire diagram. An example of the former case is a flow chart, a chart consisting of circles, squares, triangles, etc., with connecting arrows. An example of the latter case would be a pie diagram, where a circle is cut into pie-shaped sections or wedges. Besides stating the basic geometric shapes, use words for the shapes of any familiar objects, such as crescent, football, piece of bread, sausage, tear drop, etc. Describe the relative sizes of the shapes and any labels, markings, or shading on them. In addition, describe the orientation of the various figures in the diagram, i.e., how the various figures are related to one another. Describe the basic layout, if there is one.

An important subcategory of the diagram is the graph. Particularly in mathematics, graphs are widely used. Often they are hard to describe, for they can depict complicated figures, such as the projection of a three-dimensional object on a plane. Nonetheless, from my experience, having certain key features of a graph described facilitates the listener's understanding of whatever the graph is depicting.

First, a framework upon which the graph is constructed is needed. In a graph, the horizontal and vertical lines form the axes of a coordinate system. The horizontal line in general is known as the x-axis and the vertical line as the y-axis. (Any letters may be used to label the axes.) If there is a scale marked on the axes, for the horizontal axis it increases from left to right; for the vertical axis it increases from down to up. The point where the axes meet is the origin. The axes divide the plane into four quadrants: the upper right is the first, upper left is the second, lower left is the third, and lower right is the fourth. This is the basic framework upon which the graph is constructed.

The following is a list of some of the key features of a graph that should be described:

[] Read the labels on the axes and any marking or scale on the axes.

[] If possible, read from left to right, and state in which quadrant the graph begins and in which it ends.

[*]        As the graph traverses from left to right, state where it goes up or down and over what point on the x-axis it changes direction.

[*]        Describe how steeply each portion of the graph goes up or down. Compare that portion to a line which forms a particular angle with the x-axis, such as 15⁰ , 30⁰, 45⁰ , etc., if desired.

[] State at what points the graph crosses the axes, and where it reaches its local minima or maxima.

[*]        Describe the shapes of the various portions of the graph. Examples of shapes are: straight line, semicircle, parabola, sinusoid, etc.

[*]        Describe the concavity of the various portions of the graph; specify which portion is concave up (a curve that opens up or a dip) and which portion of the graph is concave down or convex (a curve that opens down or a hump).

[*]        Describe the point of inflection, i.e., the point on the graph at which the graph changes concavity.

[*]        Specify any points of discontinuity (breaks in the graph) and any cusps (sharp points on the graph).

[*]        Describe the symmetry of the graph, i.e., on which line one half of the graph is the mirror image of the other.

[*]        If there is more than one graph in the figure, describe each graph individually, and describe where they intersect or how they are related to each other.

The types of diagrams and graphs are so varied that these few pages cannot help specifically in every case. These suggestions are limited, but it is hoped that not only will they be useful in themselves, but also will inspire the interpreter to develop his own ideas to describe diagrams clearly.

This section concludes with a few examples of graphs, each (except the last) accompanied by a suggested verbal description. The last one cannot be reasonably described.

The graph is captioned: y equals x squared minus two x, a parabola. The graph has x- and y-axes and the scale for both axes is in units of one, labeled from minus three to plus three. The shape of the graph is a parabola, concave up. It is symmetric about the vertical line x equals one. The graph begins in the second quadrant and decreases steeply, almost vertically, from the upper left as it moves to the right. It crosses the origin and continues to go down into the fourth quadrant and reaches the minimum at the point one, minus one. The graph then changes direction to go up and crosses the x-axis again at the point two, zero, moves into the first quadrant and continues to go up steeply.

The graph is captioned: y equals x cubed, the cubic. The graph has x- and y-axes, and the scale for both axes is in units of one, labeled from minus four to plus four. The graph is antisymmetric about the vertical line x equals zero, the y-axis. The graph begins in the third quadrant and increases steeply as it moves to the right. As it nears the origin it flattens out somewhat, crosses the axes at the origin, remains somewhat flat close to the origin, after which it increases steeply again in the first quadrant. It is concave down for x less than zero and concave up for x greater than zero.

The graph is captioned: y equals the fraction one over x squared. The graph has x- and y-axes and the scale for both axes is in units of two, labeled from minus four to plus eight. The graph is symmetric about the vertical line x equals zero, the y-axis. The graph consists of two separate branches. The first begins in the second quadrant very close to the x-axis. As it moves to the right, the graph increases very slowly until it reaches the point minus one, one. As it continues to approach zero from the left, the graph increases steeply and nears but never touches the y-axis. That is the end of the first branch of the graph, which is entirely contained in the second quadrant. The graph has a discontinuity at x equals zero. The second branch of the graph is entirely contained in the first quadrant. It begins very close to the y-axis. As it moves to the right, the graph decreases steeply, until it reaches the point one, one, where it begins to flatten out, and slowly approaches the x-axis but never touches it. That is the end of the second branch of the graph.

The graph is captioned: y equals four times e raised to the quantity minus x squared. The graph has x- and y-axes and the scale for both axes is in units of one, labeled from minus three to plus four. The graph is a bell-shaped curve symmetric about the y-axis and concave down. The graph begins in the second quadrant near the x-axis. When x is less than minus two, the graph increases slowly. When x is greater than minus two and less than zero, the graph increases sharply and crosses the y-axis at the point zero, four. The graph then decreases rapidly for x greater than zero and less than two. For x greater than two, it decreases slowly as it approaches the x-axis but never touches it.

The graph is captioned: the step function: y equals one half when x is less than minus five, y equals one, when minus five is less than or equal to x is less than one, and y equals minus one, when x is greater than or equal to one. The graph has x- and y-axes and the scale for both axes is in units of two, labeled from minus six to plus six. The graph consists of three disjoint horizontal line segments parallel to the x-axis. The first line segment is located at y equals one half when x is less than minus five. It is entirely contained in the second quadrant. The second line segment is located at y equals one for x greater than or equal to minus five and less than one. It begins in the second quadrant, crosses the y-axis and ends near the point x equals one in the first quadrant. The third line segment is located at y equals minus one when x is greater than one. It is entirely contained in the fourth quadrant.

The graph is captioned: diagram containing two graphs: y equals x squared minus two x and y equals four x minus nine. The scale for the x- and y-axes is in units of two and is labeled from minus ten to plus ten. The parabola is described as in Example l. The second graph is a straight line which starts in the third quadrant, intersects the y-axis at the point zero, minus nine, and continues through the fourth quadrant. It intersects the x-axis at the point nine fourths, zero, and continues up into the first quadrant. The angle between the graph and the xaxis is fairly close to ninety degrees. The two graphs, the parabola and the straight line intersect at the point three, three; or the straight line is tangent to the parabola at the point three, three.

This picture is worth more than a thousand words. This diagram is so complicated that one should probably not consider describing it verbally other than reading the caption. Use of raised line drawing paper or a discussion between reader and listener of some of its main points

could be useful.
