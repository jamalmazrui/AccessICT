ABSTRACT 
This guide has been produced for organisations that wish to provide accessible information both in the education sector and more widely. 
It should be used in conjunction with the Guidelines for Accessible Information 
(the Guidelines) and is one of the outcomes of the ICT for Information Accessibility in Learning (ICT4IAL) project [http://ict4ial.eu/]. This and other useful materials on the website are open educational resources and can be freely distributed. 
Accessible information is understood as information provided in formats that allow every user and learner to access content 'on an equal basis with others' (Article 9, United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities - UNCRPD). The recommendations and implementation models in this guide are based on the experiences recorded in evaluation reports by three organisations involved in the project: 
• the International Association of Universities 
• European Schoolnet 
• the European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education. 
They trialled the draft Guidelines that had been previously developed by the project. This pilot activity resulted in revisions to the Guidelines and their practical experiences are at the core of this guide. In addition, the recommendations developed by the predecessor project, Accessible Information Provision for Lifelong Learning (i-access) [http://www.europeanagency.org/agency-projects/i-access], and expert advice on this topic have also informed the content. 
In implementing accessible information, based on the Guidelines, in your organisation we recommend the following: 
1) Include an accessibility statement in the organisation's long-term strategy. 
2) Develop a strategy or plan for implementing accessible information. 
3) Make someone responsible for implementing the information accessibility plan and provide them with the required resources. 
4) Plan an incremental implementation - be ambitious and modest at the same time. 
5) Embed accessibility into your information production and dissemination processes. 
6) Provide information, education and training on accessibility for all staff. 
7) When outsourcing information production, make sure accessibility requirements are addressed and undergo a quality check. 
This document contains details of each recommendation, along with a model of how your organisation could implement the Guidelines. 
Two appendices are also provided. The first, Appendix A - Guidelines for Accessible Information Audit Tool, is a useful template your organisation could use when auditing content. The second, Appendix B - Implementation Reports Template, is the template used by the organisations involved in the trial implementation of the Guidelines to provide feedback. 
We hope that you will find the guide useful, and we welcome feedback. In addition, we invite you to share with us your experiences of implementing information accessibility for learning. Details of how you can do so appear in the Conclusion section of this guide and on the ICT4IAL project website. 
 	 

INTRODUCTION 
This publication is intended to be used with the Guidelines for Accessible 
Information [http://ict4ial.eu/guidelines-accessible-information] (the 
Guidelines), which were developed by the ICT4IAL project 
[http://ict4ial.eu/project-aims]. The implementation recommendations that follow are the result of pilot implementations of the draft Guidelines. The pilots also resulted in revisions that led to the final version of the Guidelines. The ICT4IAL project was a multi-disciplinary network of European and international partners, representing both learning and ICT communities, that ran between 2013 and 2015. It built on the results of the Accessible Information Provision for Lifelong Learning project [http://www.europeanagency.org/agency-projects/i-access] to foster information accessibility in learning. The European Agency for Special Needs and Inclusive Education (the Agency) acted as project co-ordinator. The Agency, together with European 
Schoolnet (EUN), the International Association of Universities (IAU), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the DAISY Consortium and the Global Initiative for Inclusive ICTs (G3ict) aimed to: 
• raise awareness and increase the visibility of the issue of accessible information provision and its relevance for equitable lifelong learning opportunities; 
• support accessible information provision within organisations through the development, trialling and evaluation of guidelines that build upon existing work in the field (notably the i-access project recommendations). 
The draft version of the Guidelines was trialled within the work of three organisations - IAU, EUN and the Agency - which work across the compulsory and higher education sectors. They received support and direct input from several key advisory bodies involved in technology and accessibility: the DAISY Consortium, G3ict and UNESCO. 
Using sample content, digital documents (including those that could be printed), multimedia and web pages, the organisations were able to identify many of the challenges in applying the Guidelines to their work processes. These were detailed using a questionnaire, which intentionally captured important broader contextual information (please refer to Appendix B - Implementation Reports Template). Through this process, the organisations helped shape the final version of the Guidelines, and informed both this guide and a model of how to make organisations' information more accessible. 
The project participants are from different phases of the education sector and each was particularly interested in making their information accessible for learning. However, the Guidelines are relevant to organisations in all fields, including the commercial and voluntary sectors, and government bodies. They provide a rationale for producing accessible information, helpful definitions, and practical information on how this can be achieved, along with concrete examples. 
Each organisation implemented the Guidelines in its own way: this suggests that the way you approach this will be specific to your organisation's context and situation. This guide attempts to bring together the key elements of success, and the recommendations detailed should inform the way in which you introduce them. 
 	 

WHY YOUR ORGANISATION SHOULD CONSIDER THESE RECOMMENDATIONS 
Implementing the Guidelines should be seen in the wider context of the rights of people with disabilities. 
Your organisation has responsibilities and duties under international law and country legislation to ensure that people with disabilities can participate equally in society. When considering your implementation approach, it is helpful to take into account the accessibility concept as expressed in Article 9 of the UNCRPD [http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=269], and how it affects your organisation as a whole. The article states: 
1. To enable persons with disabilities to live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life, States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical environment, to transportation, to information and communications, including information and communications technologies and systems, and to other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas. These measures, which shall include the identification and elimination of obstacles and barriers to accessibility, shall apply to, inter alia: 
a) Buildings, roads, transportation and other indoor and outdoor facilities, including schools, housing, medical facilities and workplaces; 
b) Information, communications and other services, including electronic services and emergency services. 
2. States Parties shall also take appropriate measures: 
a) To develop, promulgate and monitor the implementation of minimum standards and guidelines for the accessibility of facilities and services open or provided to the public; 
b) To ensure that private entities that offer facilities and services which are open or provided to the public take into account all aspects of accessibility for persons with disabilities; 
c) To provide training for stakeholders on accessibility issues facing persons with disabilities; 
d) To provide in buildings and other facilities open to the public signage in 
Braille and in easy to read and understand forms; 
e) To provide forms of live assistance and intermediaries, including guides, readers and professional sign language interpreters, to facilitate accessibility to buildings and other facilities open to the public; 
f) To promote other appropriate forms of assistance and support to persons with disabilities to ensure their access to information; 
g) To promote access for persons with disabilities to new information and communications technologies and systems, including the Internet; 
h) To promote the design, development, production and distribution of accessible information and communications technologies and systems at an early stage, so that these technologies and systems become accessible at minimum cost. 
The importance of information and communications, specifically ICT and systems, is highlighted from the start. Other statements also have immediate implications for the production, distribution and use of accessible information, in particular 1 b), 2 a), b), c), g) and h). 
One hundred and sixty State Parties have expressed their consent, by an act of ratification, accession or succession, and the UNCRPD has entered into force. Twenty-seven countries have signed and committed to consider further endorsement or ratification. Eighty-seven State Parties have, additionally, ratified the optional protocol. This shows their commitments towards implementing the UNCRPD in legislation. 
More details can be viewed at: http://indicators.ohchr.org 
Your organisation should already be addressing some or many of these issues, or be looking at some aspects of ICT or e-accessibility. However, implementing the Guidelines involves more than applying techniques that enable people with disabilities and/or special needs to overcome certain barriers. It is about leadership and resources, policy and processes and their management, standards compliance and quality assurance, education and training, social responsibility and organisational strategy. 
 	 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
The following recommendations are based on the lessons learned during the ICT4IAL project. They are intended to help organisations that want to implement the Guidelines for Accessible Information. 
The seven recommendations are: 
1) Include an accessibility statement in the organisation's long-term strategy. 
2) Develop a strategy or plan for implementing accessible information. 
3) Make someone responsible for implementing the information accessibility plan and provide them with the required resources. 
4) Plan an incremental implementation - be ambitious and modest at the same time. 
5) Embed accessibility into your information production and dissemination processes. 
6) Provide information, education and training on accessibility for all staff. 
7) When outsourcing information production, make sure accessibility requirements are addressed and undergo a quality check. 
It is intended that you adopt the recommendations in the order that best suits your organisation. This will depend on the extent to which you have already considered the issue of information accessibility and whether you favour a topdown or bottom-up approach to addressing it. 
The recommendations are closely inter-related, so addressing one of them should naturally lead to the others. If the management team wants to drive this implementation, it is advisable that you address the first three recommendations first. It is important that you include accessibility in the organisation's long-term strategy and plan for implementing accessible information; this will require a person to be responsible for its implementation. 
Recommendation 1: Include an accessibility statement in 
the organisation's long-term strategy 
Include an accessibility statement in your organisation's long-term strategy. 
This can be part of your organisation's overall vision or aims statement or the detail of the operational strategy, and will depend on the nature of your organisation. 
Those working in your organisation should see this public commitment to accessibility both as a driver and as permission to develop specific strategies, policy and practice to ensure you have accessible services, including digital information. Evidence from this project and from other sources has demonstrated that an accessibility statement can have a positive impact on the reach of an organisation, and the image it projects to its clients. There is some evidence that investing in producing accessible information can result in increased income, and that making information accessible from the start is less expensive than doing it later. 
If your organisation has a written statement or public commitment on accessibility, it is more likely to be addressed and to prove sustainable. This may be true even where an organisation's focus is on people with disabilities and/or special needs. 
If you already have a policy that includes accessibility, but does not reference the provision of accessible information, this can be used as the starting point for implementing the Guidelines. Raise this with your management team, using the Guidelines and the recommendations in this guide to make the relevant case. 
Recommendation 2: Develop a strategy or plan for 
implementing accessible information 
Develop a clear plan of how you will implement a programme to improve the accessibility of the information your organisation develops and disseminates. Recognising the importance of accessibility at a strategic level is very important, but should be considered as just the starting point. Translating the commitment into action requires a policy that: 
• is agreed and supported by the organisation's leaders; 
• has people to develop the implementation plan; 
• is co-ordinated by someone authorised to ensure that it happens; 
• is resourced. 
Consider who should be involved in developing this plan. This is likely to depend on the nature of your organisation and should be flexible to accommodate the size, structure and cultural issues. Those involved may have a direct interest or involvement in the process, but it is particularly important to involve all relevant and affected stakeholders. 
A pilot study or investigation into what is needed to improve information accessibility can act as encouragement to develop a statement that is informed by your organisation's practice. Information accessibility may not be a topic that interests everyone, but it is likely to engage many staff if it is set in the context of wider benefits for all. Professionals who work in the different areas of content production are very likely to be interested in how the techniques can benefit more people. The introduction of such a strategy will require changes to existing practice - and in some cases extra work - but those who piloted the Guidelines found the topic was popular and supported by staff in their organisations. 
Ideally, your information accessibility plan should be informed by a medium- to long-term vision, which is reviewed and updated in light of the progress made. On-going developments in technology are likely to present new opportunities and challenges for accessibility which will need to be monitored and addressed. There are increasing expectations from consumers of your information - and from society in general - for organisations to be more inclusive; therefore, your plans should be flexible and adapt to accommodate these changes. 
In developing your plan, it is helpful to: 
• Frame the plan using the accessibility elements relevant to your organisation, from the principles stated in Article 9 of the UNCRPD. This will place the plan within your broader strategies for accessibility, such as the physical environment and e-accessibility. 
• Highlight the measures you intend to take in order to develop and sustain in-house knowledge about accessibility and how to implement it. 
• Set out appropriate quality assurance measures to be included in any implementation work plans or steps. 
• Consider including how you plan for accessibility to be increasingly embedded in your organisational processes and projects. 
• Include a statement about compliance with international and appropriate national accessibility standards. 
Even where there is no organisation strategy, statement or policy relating to accessibility, it is desirable to develop an approach to implementing information accessibility. Addressing this first can in turn lead to the development of appropriate statements and policies. Focusing on making information accessible - for example through a pilot, as in the case of the ICT4IAL project - should make it possible to raise the profile and importance of information accessibility. This can help develop the organisation's capacity to address the wider inclusion issues. 
Pragmatically, although it is important to have a clear vision statement and a strategy for implementing processes and procedures to increase the accessibility of the information you produce, this may not always happen first. An important lesson from the project partners was that it is possible to raise awareness within an organisation at different levels. A bottom-up approach can complement top-down implementation. For this to be sustainable beyond any pilot process, your management team must be committed to producing accessible information. None of the organisations involved in the pilot to implement the Guidelines had a policy for information accessibility when they started. However, as a result of using the Guidelines, they now recognise that this is required and expect that a policy will be developed. 
Developing and implementing an information accessibility plan requires someone in your organisation to be responsible for leading and co-ordinating the development. For the implementation to be successful, that person or team needs to have the necessary resources. 
Recommendation 3: Make someone responsible for implementing the information accessibility plan and provide them with the required resources 
Identify an individual or team to lead this development. 
When implementing a plan to make information accessible, it helps to have an individual or a team that can act as a focal point to drive it forward. This provides a focal point for developing an implementation plan to apply the Guidelines, as proposed in your organisation's long-term strategic objectives for accessibility. 
The individual or team may, for example, be involved in the final stages of information production or dissemination, have a general leadership role, or be involved in running public-facing projects or initiatives. Whether an individual or a team takes the lead will depend of the size of your organisation, or how far you have developed your overall approach to accessibility and inclusion. 
The person co-ordinating the introduction of information accessibility does not necessarily need to be a senior staff member within your organisation, but must be empowered to lead on this work. This may be through recognition of the work's importance, the authority to make changes, and by ensuring adequate resources are available. Where informal arrangements exist, it is important to formalise them, so that a person who may have voluntarily promoted accessibility is recognised and authorised by the leadership team to take a proactive role. 
Depending on the nature of the content produced, it may be necessary to invest in software or online tools and services to ensure it is accessible. This could incur some costs, hence the need for the person or team to be adequately resourced. However, in many cases, the software tools required are either inexpensive or use existing software's accessibility features. In these cases, the investment is more likely to be in developing the skills staff need when using these features, rather than spending money on expensive software. 
Recommendation 4: Plan an incremental implementation - be ambitious and modest at the same time 
Be ambitious in developing your overall plan for accessibility, as defined in your vision statement. This ambition should translate into your implementation plan, which will include all the details of what you want to achieve, with defined actions and milestones. At the same time, be realistic about the effort and complexity that may be involved. 
Your organisation's starting point, in terms adopting accessibility principles, should be to establish a baseline on which to implement the information accessibility plans. The most practical starting point may be to set out small incremental changes, possibly applying the Guidelines to simple processes first, and then moving on to more complex or costly processes. Small steps over time can lead to huge leaps in progress towards making your organisation an accessible one. 
The plan should recognise the specific nature of your organisation, i.e. available resources, size, organisational complexity, and tailor the activities accordingly. Implementing changes through small steps, delivered at first through a pilot or project, is essential for sustainable implementation, but should not distract from larger objectives. 
The Guidelines recommend a similar, staged approach, in terms of applying technical principles to different types of information in order to make them accessible. They recommend addressing text, images and audio as a first step. Once these are made accessible, they can be incorporated into more sophisticated media. The Guidelines also identify actions ranging from easy to professional, in terms of the knowledge levels required to use the software to create accessible information. It is helpful to consider these aspects when establishing working groups to implement the plan, along with the skill sets and processes required by those involved in producing accessible materials. Once you have an overall implementation plan, next consider how it can be embedded into your organisation's information and dissemination processes, and the training needs that arise. It is good practice to carry out one or several defined pilot projects outside of the daily business and with a limited scope. In this way, staff will learn through applying the principles that will have a positive effect. Once proven, these principles can be incorporated into the organisation's routine business processes. 
In summary, develop a flexible and incremental plan for implementing accessible information, but do not view this as an end in itself. It is important to review it regularly in order to ensure that it continues to meet the requirements of staff, of clients and of your organisation's strategy. 
Recommendation 5: Embed accessibility into your information production and dissemination processes 
Implement your plan and embed accessibility into your information production and dissemination processes. 
Your organisation is likely to involve external third parties in producing and disseminating information. They might be authors, translators, editors, digital design companies or website developers. 
Although you may not have addressed all of the recommendations suggested so far, it is likely that at some stage you will want to address the practical issue of applying the Guidelines. In order for them to become embedded in practice over time, all staff will have to make use of the Guidelines, in keeping with their role and function in the organisation. 
A good starting point is to analyse your information production processes. You might set up a working group of interested stakeholders to do this. This could include, for example, those involved with the website, the information technology infrastructure, or digital services. It is sensible to include those closely involved in producing and publishing electronic or print documents. Not everyone in the production team has to be involved, but during the Guidelines trial within the ICT4IAL project, most team members wanted to participate. It is important to include someone with a communications and dissemination role, as they will have expertise in how the content is received and used. 
You probably already have a system for authoring, editing, reviewing and producing digital and print content. Analysing how you can incorporate the use of the Guidelines will help you to identify how the workflow can be adapted. Changes can be agreed to ensure accessibility is addressed at all stages of the production and dissemination process. 
It is good practice to provide electronic templates and to have a style guide that includes accessibility requirements. When used by authors, editors, designers and others, this provides a set of standards for writing and designing documents, and establishes and enforces style to improve communication. 
Realistically, not all authors will follow the style guide or retain the required formatting in a template, so it is important to have editors and reviewers who do so. If the document is converted to a different format, a final accessibility check prior to production is essential. 
Where workflows require the use of accessibility principles and are embedded into the tools everyone in the process is expected to use, this not only ensures an accessible product, but also has a wider impact. It can lead to improved awareness of the organisation's general accessibility, and to external authors adopting accessible practice in other contexts. 
The Guidelines provide clear advice on the knowledge and skills required throughout the content production process. However, it is helpful to provide education and training so that staff members throughout your organisation are able to apply them. This should cover both general accessibility awareness and specialist techniques. 
Recommendation 6: Provide information, education and training on accessibility for all staff 
Establish an education and training programme, both to raise awareness of the importance of accessible information for all staff and in order to develop skills for those who need to apply the Guidelines. 
This may seem daunting for any organisation, as technology is constantly developing and bringing new accessibility challenges and opportunities. Therefore, staff will need to learn new techniques and understood and apply new standards. All staff members, both new and established, need to stay upto-date. Consider how your organisation can manage this. 
One way to ensure staff have the required skills for applying information accessibility principles is to address this during recruitment and initial induction, and through continuous professional development plans for individuals and the organisation as a whole. The level and depth of understanding required will vary depending on the job role. 
It is beneficial to have staff who are advocates for accessibility. Understanding and awareness are important elements for the adoption of changed working practice. Together with the introduction of policies for accessibility, staff training will support new ways of working. 
Depending on your organisation's information production workflow, you may wish to further segment the training you offer. One example is to provide continuous professional development at three levels: 
• For all staff: general awareness of accessibility and what this means in terms of production, distribution and the ways people will access the information. 
• For those who create original content, such as authors: generic techniques (as per the Guidelines). 
• For production and dissemination staff: knowledge and skills training on specific formats or software programs. 
All staff should receive education on why accessibility and accessible information is important. Providing information, advice and educational opportunities for all staff should help to develop an environment that is receptive to accessibility and can lead to changes in the overall culture. Those who need to know how to use accessibility features in authoring and format conversion software tools should receive targeted specialist training. If, for example, your website is developed in-house, technical staff and designers should know about accessibility guidelines and standards and how to implement them. 
Ensuring that your staff members are aware and equipped with the skills, tools and processes is an important success factor for implementing information accessibility. However, it is likely that third parties, rather than your own staff, will handle some information production or dissemination in your organisation. It is important that these third parties also apply the same high standards for accessibility that you do, and can demonstrate that they have done so. 
Recommendation 7: When outsourcing information production, make sure accessibility requirements are addressed and undergo a quality check 
When you outsource web or information content production, ensure that the developers meet accessibility requirements. 
The complexity of information production often means that some or all types of media are outsourced or commissioned. As well as requiring that the Guidelines are applied across your organisation, those commissioned to produce information on your behalf should also ensure it is accessible. 
Website development is usually commissioned with an external company paid to design and produce it, and you may also use third parties to create products such as videos and digital or print publications. 
An i-access project recommendation is that 'accessibility should be a guiding principle for procurement of all goods and services' [http://www.europeanagency.org/agency-projects/i-access/recommendations]. It advises only purchasing from organisations that fully account for accessibility issues. The Guidelines include details of the tools and standards for information accessibility. A recommended approach is to require that companies that tender for work demonstrate how they will comply, including details of the testing tools they will use and of the staff who have knowledge in testing. For website development, you should specify that the development must comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 web accessibility standards (as outlined in the Guidelines). Increasingly, countries have a legal requirement to meet this standard. Many guidance documents propose the involvement of people who use assistive technology or who have accessibility requirements. If you have staff with the necessary expertise, you may choose to manage some of this checking in-house, in order to ensure that developers have applied the appropriate techniques. 
 	 

CONCLUSION 
Making the information produced and disseminated by your organisation accessible provides benefits for staff and for those who use your products and services. It means that your staff and clients who have disabilities and/or special needs will be able to use that information and engage with you more effectively. 
Accessible information, however, is only part of how your organisation addresses the wider expectation and requirement to treat all people fairly and equally. Broader issues include the accessibility of the built environment and how you communicate and interact with staff and customers. With an increasing focus on technology, e-accessibility is likely to be an important part of your communications strategy. Within this overall approach, information accessibility is a practical area to investigate in order to drive changes within your organisation. 
The Guidelines for Accessible Information bring together in one place advice that is easy to follow, with step-by-step instructions on how to produce accessible digital documents and content. As well as useful checklists, the Guidelines include further references for those who require more detail on the techniques and tools that are available. 
If your organisation adopts the recommendations in applying the Guidelines, there will be a range of benefits. These are detailed under each recommendation, and in the Abstract and Introduction sections of this guide. 
Many organisations find that introducing processes for information accessibility is something that can be developed in a planned and managed way over time. A mixture of piloting new production approaches, increased awareness and education, and the management team's recognition of the importance of information accessibility can lead to real change. 
Identify someone in your organisation who will take these recommendations forward. It might be you, or a group of colleagues that can address them at different levels. Ask them to look at the Guidelines and investigate how they can apply to your business processes. 
Also consider the model of how your organisation could implement the Guidelines and how they might be adapted to meet your organisation's specific context and requirements. 
Finally, please remember that the Guidelines and these implementation recommendations are only a starting point. Feel free to share them with others, put them on your intranet, recommend them to your web developers and to third parties you commission to develop and disseminate your information. Take ownership of them, improve on them, and share the improvements with us and with others. 
If you would like to get involved and contribute to the Guidelines, as well as share your experiences on becoming a more accessible organisation, please visit the project website [http://ict4ial.eu/] and register. Registration will allow you to comment on various areas of the website (in English only). 
To support your implementation of the Guidelines, a model is provided outlining the interaction between policy and practice. 
This is followed by a more detailed model that builds on the recommendations. It identifies considerations and processes that different stakeholders in an organisation might explore when implementing information accessibility.

IMPLEMENTING ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION: A MODEL OF STAKEHOLDER CONSIDERATION 
Implementation focus: Information accessibility as part of your organisation's long-term strategy 
Management team Managers Staff Production and dissemination specialists Consider how your business objectives and overarching strategy addresses broader accessibility issues. When reviewing organisation aims and objectives, consider how they address accessibility, including information accessibility. For example: 
• Do you take into account the principles stated in Article 9 of the UNCRPD? 
• Does your vision statement include Consider how aware and responsive you are to your staff and clients' accessibility requirements. For example: 
• Are you aware of staff's accessibility needs and of the needs of those they work with or to whom they provide a service? 
• Does this include information provision and can you support staff in providing information that is fully accessible? Consider whether your organisation addresses the accessibility needs of those you work with, or to whom you deliver a service. Does your organisation provide, for example: 
• Practical guidance on accessibility that you can apply, and are there routes so that you can highlight the need for such support? 
• Training and awareness opportunities on accessibility, including information Consider if you need guidance and training to ensure the information outputs that you provide are accessible for all your end users. For example: 
• Do you have clear guidance or templates for forms, multimedia or other electronic content that you work on? 
• Are you aware of standards for accessible content design and production? 
• Does the organisation's style guide include Management team Managers Staff Production and dissemination specialists accessibility? 
• Do you have an 
accessibility policy, and does it include accessible information? 
• Do you have an accessibility strategy that empowers managers and staff? • Can you raise this issue with the management team in order to develop a policy or improve working practice? accessibility? 
• A lead person on accessibility issues, including practical concerns such as accessible information and communication? accessibility requirements?  	 
Implementation focus: A specific strategy or plan for implementing accessible information 
Management team Managers Staff Production and dissemination specialists Consider how best to develop and apply a plan for making your organisation's information accessible. Your plan should: 
• Highlight the measures you intend to take in order to develop and sustain in-house knowledge about accessibility and how to implement it. 
• Set out appropriate quality assurance measures to be included in any implementation work plans or steps. 
• Consider how 
accessibility will be increasingly embedded Consider if your clients or staff members have raised the need for information to be more accessible. Have they highlighted certain difficulties or barriers to using different forms of digital content? 
If this is the case, consider:

Implementation focus: Make someone responsible for implementing the information 
accessibility plan and provide them with the required resources 
Management team Managers Staff Production and dissemination specialists Consider designating someone to co-ordinate the implementation of your information accessibility plan. In doing this you might take into account: 
• Giving the lead person the authority required to implement and embed the plan. 
• The level of resourcing needed to fully deliver the plan. 
• That people involved in a range of organisational processes will need to know how to provide accessible information. 
• If you have an Consider how you can contribute to the successful implementation of your organisation's information accessibility plan. For example:

Implementation focus: Plan an incremental implementation - be ambitious and modest at the same time 
Management team Managers Staff Production and dissemination specialists Consider how best to embed information accessibility into your organisation's culture, so it is sustained in the long term. Some starting points include: 
• Establishing a baseline for the accessibility level of your information and electronic communications. 
• Deciding whether you will adopt a bottom-up pilot to look at creating accessible information, or a top-down policydriven approach, or both. 
• Considering how you Consider realistic targets for implementing information accessibility in line with your organisation's strategy. Encourage staff to: 
• Create presentations or documents using the organisation's 
templates or style guide (which have been created using the Guidelines). 
• Apply the built-in accessibility features in office software. 
• Practice what you preach - apply the Guidelines to your practice by creating accessible presentations Consider incremental steps in learning about information accessibility that is applicable to your role within the organisation. You do not need to be an expert, but applying some basic principles will make a real difference. 
You may for example: 
• Explore the accessibility features in the software you use. 
• Ask for guidance on producing accessible documents or other forms of written communication. 
• Always follow the organisation's Consider the specific ways you can apply accessibility to your daily practice in an increasingly systematic way. This may include: 
• Involvement in pilot activities to develop accessible content and communication work processes, in line with the Guidelines. 
• Learning about the advanced features of the software you use each day. 
• Applying technical principles to different types of information in order to make them accessible.

Implementation focus: Embed accessibility into your information production and dissemination processes 
Management team Managers Staff Production and dissemination specialists Consider how you can ensure that a pilot or plan for information accessibility results in practical changes to the way you produce and share information. To embed any changes it is important to: 
• Update the business processes and related documentation to reflect the new requirements. 
• Monitor the new processes to ensure they are being correctly applied. 
• Provide the necessary training and support for those involved in Consider strategies to support staff in applying your organisation's approach to information accessibility. This might include: 
• Awareness or refresher sessions on the relevant business processes. 
• Peer mentoring for those who undertake similar information production tasks. 
• Celebrating or sharing when new information types are made accessible. This might include case studies or advocates explaining the benefits this provides for end users. Consider the difference that your organisation is making by producing information that is accessible for people with disabilities and/or special needs. 
• Ask clients or colleagues how they benefit from the improved processes, and if further improvements can be made. 
• It is likely to take some time to apply accessibility principles to all the information in your organisation. You can help by updating information for which you are directly Consider how you can make changes in practice to ensure information accessible principles are consistently and regularly applied. This might be achieved through:

F 	Experiences - lessons learned 
1. General experience statement 
[Give in a few sentences a general experience statement after having finalised the production of the selected documents supposed to be accessible.]       
2. Difficulties and challenges encountered 
[Thinking about the production workflows, what were the challenges/difficulties with respect to the aspects mentioned? The given comments are based on experience; they may be helpful when summarising your experience.] 
• Authoring 
[It could be, for instance, your publication comprises pieces from various authors who send you their parts in different formats, different styles, handwritten, with or (more likely) without tagging the header levels, etc. Usually, such cases complicate the production workflows and make them inefficient (not only with respect to accessibility). There may be other challenges you encountered.] 
      
• Editing 
[The editor is not necessarily the author; if not, there is an interface between authoring and editing that may cause/generate challenges; in order to minimise those challenges, corresponding processes often need to be defined/agreed on. The editor may not be familiar with the issue of accessibility at all; they may not be familiar with the built-in features or addons of the software used for creating accessible documents.] 
      
• Proof-reading 
[Normally, proof-reading processes/rounds are carried out; mainly if several people are involved, this may generate difficulties or make the process inefficient again: when specific accessibility features are overwritten and/or when an editor needs to re-integrate them.] 
      
• Format conversion 
[If you want or need to deliver more than one output format, there will be conversions from the original document format to others; these conversion processes often lead to loss of the accessibility of the original document.]       
3. Difficulties and challenges if the technical part of the production was done by a third party 
[If you handed over the technical production of a document to a third party, did you encounter specific additional challenges or difficulties?]       
4. Need for internal staff to be educated regarding accessibility 
[After having finalised the production of the accessible documents, do you see a need for education/training for those who are involved with authoring, editing and publishing information? Please indicate those needs (if applicable) for the topics mentioned, develop your thinking and give the rationales for it.] 
• General education/training about what accessibility is and what it means with respect to the concrete production, distribution and consumption of information. 
• Education/training on the built-in accessibility features in the software used, like Word, InDesign, etc. 
      
5. Need for re-thinking the workflows and internal guidelines for producing accessible information 
[After having finalised the production of the accessible documents, do you see a need to re-think the applied workflows and to establish (or revise) accordingly internal publishing guidelines that contributors to publications must follow in order to provide accessible publications?]       
6. Need for re-thinking procurement requirements if parts of the production are outsourced 
[In this case (if applicable), do you see a need for changing your procurement policy by introducing accessibility requirements? If yes, please indicate what your requirements would be.] 
      
 	 
G 	Helpfulness/usefulness of the Guidelines 
1. Usefulness of the Guidelines 
[Describe in which respect and to what extent the Guidelines are useful and helped you in producing accessible information.]
