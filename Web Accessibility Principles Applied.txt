Language of Page
  Most people today can hardly conceive of life without the internet. Some have argued that no other single invention has 
been more revolutionary since Gutenberg's printing press in the 
   1400s. Now, at the click of a mouse, the world can be "at your fingertips"-that is, if you can use a mouse... and see the screen... and hear the audio-in other words, if you don't have a disability of any kind.

• Semantics (lists, links, etc.) are removed from referenced content.
• Should be succinct.
Hidden ARIA and HTML labels and descriptions
• <label> hidden with CSS display:none will not be read by screen readers.
• Elements hidden with display:none, but referenced by aria-labelledby or ariadescribedby WILL be read.
<label for="user">Username:</label>

WCAG 2.1 - Identify Input Purpose (Level AA)
The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined when:
• The input field serves a purpose identified in the Input Purposes for User Interface Components section; and
• The content is implemented using technologies with support for identifying the expected meaning for form input data.
Currently requires appropriate autocomplete attribute values for inputs that collect user information.
