for iOS and iPadOS 18.5

Intro

VoiceOver is Apple’s screen reader, which can be found across all Apple platforms, from iPhones, iPads, Macs, iPods, etc. This guide will document how each setting in VoiceOver’s settings on iOS and iPadOS affects the way VoiceOver behaves, as well as what the options do.

At the time of writing, May 2025, the release of iOS 19 and associated operating systems is really closed to being released in beta. Once they release to the public, this guide will be updated to reflect new changes, features, and settings.

Main VoiceOver settings screen

The main VoiceOver settings screen gives you quick access to learn about VoiceOver gestures, try a VoiceOver tutorial, and launch VoiceOver practice, as well as customization options to further customize VoiceOver to your liking.

1.  VoiceOver toggle switch

-   Use this toggle to turn VoiceOver on or off. When turning off VoiceOver, you may get an alert asking if you are sure you want to disable VoiceOver.

2.  Information on basic gestures, as well as a link to learn more.

-   Basic gestures listed include selecting an item under your finger and activating the selected item. Other VoiceOver gestures can be found by clicking the learn more link.

3.  A “What’s new in VoiceOver” link which will show you everything that is new in VoiceOver for the current major release, such as iOS 18.

-   iOS 18 is currently the only release to have this link, but as new versions of iOS come out, they should hopefully have this link as well.

4.  VoiceOver practice:

-   Brings up a screen to practice VoiceOver gestures and allows you to perform any gesture on the screen to have VoiceOver read it back to you, and what it does, such as notifying you that the swipe right gesture moves to the next item.

5.  VoiceOver Tutorial

-   Brings up an interactive tutorial to teach you how to use VoiceOver from the very beginning.

6.  SPEAKING RATE

-   Allows you to adjust the speaking rate of the current voice (how fast or slow VoiceOver talks).

The remainder of the VoiceOver settings screen is devoted to customizing VoiceOver, such as the voice, braille options, verbosity options, etc.

Speech

The speech options allow you to change the primary voice, add voices to the voice rotor, adjust pronunciations, and more.

1.  Primary Voice

-   Here is where you can control the primary voice to be used with VoiceOver. If you have not added any other voices to your voice rotor, this will be the voice that VoiceOver uses by default when speaking text in your native language. If you have not customized this before, this will be set to Samantha if your language is English US. The default voice is different based on the language of your device.

2.  ADDITIONAL VOICES

-   Add voices to the voice rotor, and they will show up in this section. You can tap on the voice to customize it.
-   At the bottom of this section will be an option to add a voice.

3.  Pitch Change

-   This controls if VoiceOver should change pitch. This is a global setting. This will not affect the pitch you have selected per voice.

4.  Detect Languages

-   Toggles whether VoiceOver should read text in other languages in that language, or try to process it in your native language.

5.  Pronunciations

-   Allows you to adjust how VoiceOver speaks certain words. For example, you could change the way VoiceOver says VO from “Voe” to “V O”. #### Adding a voice When you press the add voice button, you will be presented with a list of languages. After selecting a language, you will be shown a list of voices in that language. This list can range from just 1 or 2 voices to hundreds depending on your language. I will list the supported languages and voices at the end of this guide.

Voice customization options

Depending on the voice you have selected, the customization options may vary. ##### General customizations For all voices, the following options will be available to you: (The options in this screen only affect the voice you are currently editing and do not affect other voices.)

1.  Voice – Option to change the voice (only appears for the primary voice. Delete and re-add a voice from the rotor if you added the wrong voice).
2.  RATE

-   allows you to adjust the rate for the current voice.
-   This adjusts the rate per voice. Adjusting the speaking rate slider in the main VoiceOver settings controls the speaking rate of the primary voice.

3.  PITCH

-   Allows you to adjust how high or low the voice talks for normal speech.

4.  SPEECH VOLUME

-   adjusts how loud or quiet the voice is (does not adjust system volume).

5.  Voice specific customization options

-   shows customization options per voice (see below).

6.  audio effects

-   As of iOS 18, the only audio effect is the equalizer, which will allow you to adjust particular frequencies to make them louder or quieter. Each band of the EQ can be adjusted plus or negative 20 DB, with 0 being the default.

7.  Reset Voice Settings

-   resets all of your settings for the particular voice to the default.
-   This option does not warn you before resetting your options to default.

Voice specific customization options

Each TTS (Text To Speech) engine has its own customization option, and will be listed below. These options can be found when editing a voice as described above.

MacinTalk (Alex, Fred, etc).

1.  Pitch Range

-   Adjusts the inflection of the voice.
-   0 is no inflection, where the voice sounds almost like a robot, with 200 being the max. The default is 100.

2.  WPM Minimum

-   adjusts how slow the voice speaks when the rate is at 0%. This can go from 50 to 175 words per minute.

3.  WPM Maximum

-   Adjusts the fastest the voice can speak. 500 is the default, but this can be adjusted up to 900 words per minute.

Vocalizer (includes Nicky, English U.S.).

1.  Timbre

-   Adjusts the formants and slightly adjusts the pitch of the voice. The lower the number, the more the voice sounds deeper and bigger. When the number is above 100, the voice will sound more like a small child or chipmunk. 100 is the default.

2.  Sentence Pause

-   adjusts how long VoiceOver should wait after speaking a sentence before going on to the next one.
-   This does not apply to reading back controls, such as “Search, button”, or “VoiceOver, heading”. This applies to reading full sentences, such as “Hello. The weather is nice today.”

Eloquence

1.  Rate Multiplier

-   Adjusts the speed that Eloquence speaks at a current rate. The default is 100, but this control can be adjusted from 50 to 200.

2.  Head Size

-   similar to tamber for vocalizer voices, but does not adjust pitch.
-   Drag the slider down to make the head size smaller, and adjust it upwards to make the head size bigger.

3.  Pitch Base

-   This is like the pitch slider. You can adjust the pitch base in hertz. The default is 65Hz, but the slider can go from 40 to 422Hz. Note: if you adjust the pitch base to the lowest or highest setting, it may be slightly harder to set it back to 65Hz. You can double tap and hold, and then drag left and right to find 65Hz. Alternatively, reset the voice back to its defaults.

4.  Pitch Range

-   Just like MacinTalk voices, it adjusts the inflection of the voice. The default is 30, but this value can go from 0 to 100.

5.  Breathiness

-   It adds a breathiness to the voice. At 100, the voice is a whisper. The default is 0.

6.  Roughness

-   It adds a roughness to the voice which makes it sound deeper without changing the pitch. The effect is hard to explain, so I would recommend you try it out yourself.

7.  Higher Sample Rate

-   This adjusts the sample rate of Eloquence. This changes the way the voice sounds. Experiment with this to see which option you like better.

8.  Phrase Prediction

-   Phrase Prediction attempts to add a pause, such as for a comma if none exists in the content that is being read.

9.  Abbreviation Dictionary

-   It attempts to change the way the speech synthesizer pronounces abbreviations.

10. Community Dictionary

-   It attempts to fix the pronunciations of some words that the speech synthesizer gets wrong.

Siri (English US only)

For the English US Siri voices, you can change the speaking style of the voice. This is available for all 5 Siri voices.

1.  Default

-   This is the default speaking style of the voice.

2.  Even Inflection

-   This evens out the inflection of the voice, almost like reducing the pitch range with other voices.

3.  Faster Pace

-   Uses basically the default inflection but makes the voice speak faster.

4.  Even Inflection & Faster Pace

-   Allows you to use even inflection while making the voice speak faster.

5.  Narration

-   This allows you to make the voice sound more like it is narrating something. This changes the speaking style more than the other presets.

For all other Siri voices, there are no customization options beyond the default ones available for all voices.

Pronunciations

This screen allows you to manually adjust the pronunciations of words and phrases you add.

1.  Add

10. Word Wrap

-   Determines if words at the end of a line will end with a dash and then continue on the next line.

1.  Text Formatting

-   I am not sure what this affects, but I would guess that this determines if text formatting is displayed on the Braille display.

12. Braille Alert Messages

-   This allows you to control the duration that alerts and announcements appear on the Braille display.

13. Ignore Chord Duration

-   Determines how long holding down a key registers as a keypress or a Braille chord.

VoiceOver recognition allows you to get image descriptions from controls, as well as screen recognition, which makes apps more accessible.

Live Recognition

This option is used to determine which live recognition options appear in the live recognition rotor or when you invoke live recognition with a four-finger triple tap or a custom gesture. The ordering may vary, but the available options are as follows: (Options requiring the LightR sensor will not display on iPhones or iPads without this sensor.) 1.

Commands

This section allows you to modify commands and voiceover gestures. The options in this screen are self-explanatory, but I will give a brief description.

In the commands section, you can browse by all commands, touch gestures, or keyboard shortcuts. - If you select all commands, you will see a list of categories. In each one of these are the commands. Double tap the command to see touch gestures and keyboard shortcuts. - If touch gestures is tapped, you will see a list of all possible gestures that can be assigned. Tapping on one of these will allow you to change the command it is assigned to. - If keyboard shortcuts are tapped, you will see a list of all commands that have keyboard shortcuts. - You can also assign commands to hand righting and BSI the same way from this screen.

Rotor

This screen allows you to configure options for the rotor.

To use the rotor, put two fingers on the screen and rotate them as if turning a dial. If you are having trouble, try using your thumb and index finger or your thumb and third finger.

Another way people use to activate the rotor is to put two fingers on the screen and move one up while moving the other one down. Alternatively, you can put 2 fingers on the screen and move one left and the other one right. If you are doing this, make sure that your fingers are on top of each other but not touching if moving horizontally, or right next to each other if using the vertical method described. You can move your fingers in both directions as long as they are moving opposite each other to change the rotor to the next/previous item.

To adjust the rotor item, use a one-finger swipe up/down.

Rotor Items

Allows you to show/hide rotor items. They can be rearranged by finding the reorder button and swiping up or down to rearrange the item, or double-tap and hold to drag the item. You can select or deselect an item by tapping its name.

You can find a list of rotor items at the end of this guide and what they do.

Change Rotor with Item

Adjusts whether the rotor can change to another item based on what you are focused on. For example, if focused on an item with no actions, you will most likely be on the characters item. Focus on an item with actions, and the rotor will switch to actions automatically. Once you move to another item with no actions, the rotor will return to the last item that was used. If this setting is turned off, the rotor will remain on whatever item you set it to unless you change it.

Edit Apps on Home Screen

-   Determines if actions to edit apps on the home screen appear. If turned off, no actions will be available.

Direct Touch Apps

Shows a list of apps installed on your device. Select any apps you wish for direct touch to be on when opening that app. If you can’t disable direct touch in an app, you can turn off direct touch for an app by going to the app switcher, focusing on the app in question, and turning off direct touch from the rotor.

Typing

This section allows you to control the way VoiceOver responds when typing.

Typing Style

Allows you to control how VoiceOver speaks when typing.

1.  Standard Typing: Touch a key to hear what it is, and then double tap to activate the key, just like any other UI element.
2.  Touch Typing: Move your finger over the keyboard. When you hear a key you want to activate, lift your finger and it will be inserted.
3.  Direct Touch Typing: Behaves as if VoiceOver is off. Touching a key enters it into the text field, effectively making the keyboard behave the same as sighted users are used to.

Phonetic Feedback:

Determines if phonetics are spoken.

1.  Off: no phonetics are spoken.
2.  Character and Phonetics: Speaks the phonetics after reading the character, such as “H, hotel”.
3.  Phonetics Only: Only reads phonetics, such as “India”.

Typing Feedback

Controls how VoiceOver speaks when you are typing. The options are the same for Software keyboards, hardware keyboards, and braille screen input.

1.  Nothing: no output is spoken.
2.  Characters: speaks the characters you enter.
3.  Words: Speaks words when you enter punctuation or the space bar.
4.  Characters and Words: Speaks characters as you type, and then speaks the typed word when you press space or enter a punctuation mark.

Modifier Keys

Allows you to select between control+option, caps lock, and control+option and caps lock. Note, when caps lock is selected, double-press caps lock to turn on or off caps lock.

Keyboard Interaction Time

Determines the time needed to hold on the keyboard to begin slide to type.

Quick Settings

The Quick Settings option in Settings has options that you can select or deselect to add them to the quick settings screen. Tap 4 times with 2 fingers to open Quick Settings.

Navigation Style

You can change the navigation style to behave more like macOS, where things are grouped, and you can interact and stop interacting with them. You can select between flat and grouped. ### Navigate Images determines if VoiceOver focus moves to images on the web.

It has been noted that adjusting this also affects apps. For example, setting this to never will not allow you to navigate to images in the photos app by the swipe right/left gesture.

1.  Always: always moves to images
2.  With descriptions: moves to images with descriptions or alt text).
3.  never: never navigates to images.

Large Cursor (Switch Button)

The large cursor makes the visual voiceover curser bigger and easier to see.

Caption Panel

The caption panel shows the text that VoiceOver is speaking on the screen.

Delay before Selection

This controls when VoiceOver activates after you touch the screen. Increase this value for accidental taps to not be recognized.

Double-tap Timeout

The double tap time out allows you to increase or decrease how fast or slow you need to double tap the screen. Increase the value to make it easier to tap the screen twice more slowly, or decrease it if you wish for VoiceOver to respond quicker after double tapping the screen.

Conclusion

This guide contains every option listed in VoiceOver’s settings. I hope you have found this guide helpful to you. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
