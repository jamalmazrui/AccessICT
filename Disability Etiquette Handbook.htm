<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Recreational Sports Department at University of California Berkeley
is committed to creating a positive inclusive environment in all its
services, programs and facilities. The purpose of this handbook is to
support this initiative as training material for staff in disability
etiquette.</p>
<p>The lack of awareness about disabilities can lead to unintended
stereotypes and discrimination. Access to programs and facilities starts
with good customer service!</p>
<p>The following tips reflect generally accepted protocol and language.
Customers with disabilities, when treated as valued customers, will
share information on the accessibility of the programs and
facilities.</p>
<p>Definitions</p>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</p>
<p>Provides comprehensive civil rights protection to individuals with
disabilities in all aspects of life, from housing, education and public
services to transportation.</p>
<p>• Equal access to facilities and services: physical access and
information through</p>
<p>“effective communication.”</p>
<p>• Equal opportunity</p>
<p>• Integrated rather than separate facilities</p>
<p>The ADA is a Civil Rights Law</p>

<p>Disability</p>
<p>A person with a disability under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act &amp; ADA is defined as: • a person with a physical or mental
impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities;
or</p>
<p>• a person with a record of such a physical or mental impairment;
or</p>
<p>• a person who is regarded as having a physical or mental
impairment.</p>
<p>Accessible</p>
<p>Refers to a site, facility, work environment, service, or program
that is easy to approach, enter, operate, participate in, and/or use
safely and with dignity by a person with a disability.</p>
<p>Accommodation</p>
<p>Any change in the service environment or in the way things are
customarily done that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy
equal service opportunities</p>
<p>• Services</p>
<p>• Equipment</p>
<p>• Assistive Technology</p>
<p>• Change in policy/procedure to allow access for a person with a
disability <strong>Inclusion</strong></p>
<p>The active, intentional, and ongoing engagement of diversity, where
each person is valued, respected and supported for his or her
distinctive skills, experiences and perspectives, to create an
environment where everyone has an opportunity to experience personal
fulfillment and participate fully</p>
<p><strong>At its simplest is ‘the state of being included’</strong>. It
is a <strong>universal human</strong> <strong>right</strong> whose aim
is to embrace all people, irrespective of race, gender, disability or
other attribute, which can be perceived as different.</p>

<p>About Disability</p>
<p><em>Di</em> sability is the one diversity category that crosses
gender, race,</p>
<p>ethnicity, religion, age and socioeconomic class.</p>
<p><strong>People with disabilities are like everyone else.</strong>
They are people first and have the same hopes, dreams, fears, hobbies,
jobs and interests as the rest of the community. The disability is not
what a person identifies with the most; it is just a part of the whole
self, like being left handed or having red hair.</p>
<p>Disability can be inherited or acquired as a result of accident,
injury or age. <strong>Disability</strong> <strong>can happen at any
time, to anyone!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Some disabilities are visible and some are not.</strong>
Someone who uses a cane or a wheelchair obviously has a disability.
However, many disabilities are “hidden” such as learning disabilities,
psychiatric disabilities and some physical disabilities. Epilepsy,
cancer, arthritis and heart conditions are some examples of “hidden”
physical disabilities. People tend to believe these are not
disabilities, but they are. Although the disabilities are not visible,
these individuals are legitimately affected in their major life
activities.</p>
<p>A disability is not a negative characteristic and should not be
portrayed as such.</p>
<p><strong>Disability is diverse as the community we live in.</strong>
So, when speaking about or to people with disabilities, focus on
abilities and individual qualities. Portray them as they are in real
life – humans! Make reference to the person first.</p>
<p>Don’t patronize nor idolize individuals with disabilities. They are
people living their daily lives just like everyone else.</p>

<p><img src="media/index-5_2.png" style="width:1.66667in;height:9in"
alt="Image 10" /></p>
<p>Effective Communication</p>
<p>We all communicate in various ways with or without a disability.
Although there may be a few specific communication strategies to keep in
mind when assisting a person with a disability, good communication
skills can be applied to all service situations, and should be used with
all consumers. Pay attention to cues from the person you are
communicating with.</p>
<p>The Power of Words</p>
<p><em><strong>Words are powerful!</strong></em> Our language shapes our
attitudes and our attitudes shape our language. And our
<em><strong>words have a profound effect on other
people</strong></em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Words lead to actions.</strong></em> Good words lead to
good actions. By using words or labels that devalue someone, it makes it
easier to discriminate. Sadly, this has historically happened to people
with disabilities. Many old labels focus on the disability, what’s
different about that person, what someone can’t do. But, we can change
that.</p>
<p>Using “Person First” Language puts the person first, Not the
disability! It allows us to focus on what we have in common and our
strengths instead of what is different. It isn’t that disability isn’t a
part of that person’s life… it’s just that it doesn’t have to be the one
and only defining aspect of their personality.</p>
<p><strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> If you are ever unsure of:
acceptable language, acceptable etiquette, or anything else: It is OK to
Ask. To be unaware and courteous is understandable, and often invited.
To make assumptions is unacceptable <strong>What are the ADA requirement
for customer</strong></p>
<p>service?</p>
<p>• Remove barriers</p>
<p><strong>•</strong> Provide <strong>auxiliary aids and
services</strong> for effective communication</p>
<p>• <strong>Reasonably</strong> modify policies, practices, or
procedures</p>
<p>• <strong>Ensure there are</strong> no unnecessary eligibility
criteria</p>

alt="Image 13" /></p>
<p>Remove barriers</p>
<p>Barriers: Obstacles that prevent people with disabilities from fully
participating in society, they could be physical or attitudinal.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Barriers</strong>: obstacles that hinder people with
physical disabilities from gaining access.</p>
<p><strong>Attitudinal Barriers</strong>: fears and assumptions that
prevent people with and without disabilities from meaningfully
interacting with one another.</p>
<p>Stereotyping: assuming that people with a disability quality of life
is poor or that they are unhealthy because of their impairments.</p>
<p>Stigma, prejudice, and discrimination: Within society, these
attitudes may come from people’s ideas related to disability—People may
see disability as a personal tragedy, as something that needs to be
cured or prevented, as a punishment for wrongdoing, or as an indication
of the lack of ability to behave as expected in society.</p>
<p>To creating a welcoming environment: two main elements of inclusive
culture are required to ensure equal access and full participation:
<strong>Attitude and</strong> <strong>Commitment</strong> The attitude
and behaviors of others can be the most difficult barriers for people
with disabilities to overcome</p>

<p>The Basics</p>
<p>Offering assistance</p>
<p>All customers are individuals. Persons with disabilities come in all
shapes and sizes with diverse personalities, abilities, interests,
needs, and preferences--- just like every other customer.</p>
<p>The best way to learn how to accommodate customers with disabilities
is to ask them directly.</p>
<p>Just because someone has a disability, don’t assume s/he needs help.
If the setting is accessible, people with disabilities can usually get
around fine.</p>
<p>Always direct communication to the person with a disability. Unsure
what to do?</p>
<p><strong>Ask</strong>! Make a mistake? Apologize, correct, learn and
move on.</p>
<p>Treat adults as adults. <strong>Relax!</strong></p>
<p>Respond graciously to requests.</p>
<p>When people who have a disability ask for an accommodation, it is not
a complaint. It shows they feel comfortable enough in the facility to
ask for what they need. And if they get a positive response, they will
probably come back again and tell others about the good service they
received.</p>
<p>Adults with disabilities want to be treated as independent
people.</p>
<p>Offer assistance only if the person appears to need it.</p>
<p>A person with a disability will oftentimes communicate when s/he
needs help. If s/he does want help, <strong>ask</strong> how before you
act.</p>

<p><img src="media/index-8_3.png"
style="width:6.20833in;height:4.97222in" alt="Image 18" /></p>
<p><strong>Relax</strong>. Don’t make assumptions based on appearance
alone. The best resource for information is the person, so Ask!</p>
<p>Maintain natural language and tone when interacting with people whom
have disabilities.</p>
<p>Professional behaviors such as active listening, a service-minded
orientation, and a results-focus work equally well with people with
disabilities as with all other people. Remember the core pieces of
excellent customer service.</p>

<p>Disability Etiquette Tips</p>
<p>Meet and Greet</p>
<p><strong>JUST LIKE YOU:</strong> Treat people with disabilities just
like anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>SMILE:</strong> Remember to smile. Smiles are important
during the meeting and greeting process.</p>
<p><strong>MAKE EYE CONTACT:</strong> Making eye contact is fundamental
to both you and the person with a disability. Even with people who are
blind, they can hear where your voice is coming from and know if you are
directly facing them.</p>
<p><strong>SHAKE HANDS:</strong> If the person cannot shake your hand
they will tell you. <strong>Do not</strong> <strong>be ashamed of your
attempt,</strong> however you could gently touch that individual on
their arm during an introduction while smiling, speaking and looking
directly at the person. Shake hands with a person who has a prosthetic
hand or arm. Shake a prosthetic hand as you would do with anyone else.
When meeting a person who is blind, you could say “I would like to shake
your hand” in order to offer an auditory cue. Shake hands with your left
hand with someone that does not have a right hand.</p>
<p><strong>WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY:</strong> If someone who
experiences hearing loss requires sign language and no sign language
interpreter is present, offer your business card and find paper and pen
and write down what you would like to say. Reinforce what you say by
directly facing the person in case they can lip read.</p>
<p><strong>PLACEMENT OF AN INTERPRETER:</strong> A person who uses a
sign language interpreter should be the one to request where the
interpreter sits or stands. If you are introduced to someone who uses a
sign language interpreter speak directly to the person with hearing loss
as you move your eyes and face in the direction of that person. Your
facial expressions, gestures and expressions of animation and the
intensity of your speech are important and will be noted by the person
to whom you are speaking..</p>
<p><strong>MEETING A PERSON WHO IS BLIND OR HAS LOW VISION:</strong>
Identify yourself and those that may have accompanied you. Inform the
person if you must leave and end the conversation. If offering
assistance do not grab their cane. Ask if they would like assistance,
wait for a response and state, “Would you like to take my arm?”. Never
assume they can’t see you – many people who have low vision still have
some sight.</p>
<p><img src="media/index-10_1.png"
style="width:4.23611in;height:0.72222in" alt="Image 21" /></p>
<p><img src="media/index-10_2.png"
style="width:6.16667in;height:1.76389in" alt="Image 22" /></p>
<p><strong>UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND:</strong> People with disabilities want
you to hear, understand, and respond to them when they request
assistance or when they are in a conversation with you. In order to
understand a request for assistance or, what is being shared during a
conversation, feel comfortable to state “I am unable to understand what
you are saying, could you repeat what you have just said?” or “Let us
move out to the other room where it is quieter.” Ask the person what it
is that they need in order for you to provide assistance if appropriate.
Being honest makes you an effective communicator.</p>
<p><strong>SPEECH IMPAIRMENT:</strong> Do not act as if you understand
what is being shared in a conversation with someone who has speech
impairment when you do not understand.</p>
<p>Inform the person you do not understand and try again. Do not finish
the sentence or talk for someone that has speech impairment. <strong>Be
patient.</strong> Communication preferences for people with hearing loss
may also be preferred by people who have speech impairments.</p>
<p><strong>COSMETIC DISFIGUREMENT:</strong> When meeting a person with a
cosmetic disfigurement, continue eye contact and act as you would with
anyone else. People with cosmetic disfigurements are covered by the ADA
and included in the regulatory definition of impairment.</p>
<p><strong>ACCENTS</strong>: If you have an accent it may be difficult
for people who experience hearing loss to understand what you are
saying. Be prepared to repeat what you say and possibly if requested
spell a specific word that is not well understood.</p>
<p><strong>COCHLEAR IMPLANT:</strong> If someone has a cochlear implant,
they are able to hear and learn to interpret speech and other sounds but
depending upon the success of the implant and how long it has been since
the implant was inserted and, for some, the progress they have made in
speech and sound rehabilitation, they may still need to lip read or use
a sign language interpreter. Speak in a normal tone while directly
facing the person and enunciate the words you speak as you would with
anyone else. Do not increase the volume of your voice or slow down your
speech (unless requested), or, exaggerate lip movements.</p>
<p><strong>SIGNIFICANT INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY:</strong> When meeting
someone who may have a significant intellectual disability do what you
would do when meeting anyone else but in your own assessment of the
interaction, you may want to use shorter sentences and potentially
easier to understand words.</p>
<p><strong>AUTISM SPECTRUM:</strong> When meeting someone with an autism
spectrum disability you may not be aware of the disability. People with
Asperger Syndrome do not necessarily have language deficits but could
have challenges interacting in some social situations or in a
professional context.</p>

<p><img src="media/index-11_2.png" style="width:0.95833in;height:9in"
alt="Image 24" /></p>
<p><strong>SIT DOWN &amp; RELAX</strong>: For longer conversations with
a person who uses a wheelchair or, someone who does not stand for long
periods of time, pull up a chair and sit down in order to conduct a
conversation while at eye contact level.</p>
<p>It is okay to feel nervous or uncomfortable around people with
disabilities,</p>
<p>and it is okay to admit that. It’s only human to feel that way at
first.</p>
<p>Everyone is uncomfortable in situations they are not familiar with.
When</p>
<p>you encounter these situations, think “person first” instead of
disability;</p>
<p>you will eventually relax.</p>
<p>General Guidelines when…</p>
<p>Interacting with a Person with a Physical Disability</p>
<p>• Never use a person’s disability to improve another individual’s
perspective on life.</p>
<p>• Make sure your workout site is accessible.</p>
<p>• Ask ahead of time if the person will need any accommodations.</p>
<p>• Speak to the person the same way you would speak to a person
without a disability. No need to crouch or kneel to the level of the
individual if your interaction will be brief.</p>
<p>• Get to know your clients level of function. Just because they use a
wheelchair doesn’t mean that they can’t stand or wouldn’t choose to
transfer out of it.</p>
<p>• Offer your client choices whenever appropriate but never over
adapt.</p>
<p>• Do not push, lean on, or hold onto a person's wheelchair unless the
person asks you to. The wheelchair is part of his/her personal
space.</p>
<p>Interacting with a Person with a Sensory Disability</p>
<p>• Always verbally introduce and excuse yourself when you join or
leave a conversation with an individual who is visually impaired.</p>
<p>• Be specific when describing the location of objects.</p>
<p>• If an individual has difficulty speaking, do not assume they have
an intellectual disability or alter your own speech or attitude.</p>
<p>• Allow sufficient time for communication, do not attempt to finish
their sentence or provide words before they can say them.</p>
<p>• If a person has hearing loss, let them take the lead in
establishing the communication mode, such as lip-reading, sign language,
or writing notes.</p>

<p><img src="media/index-12_2.png" style="width:1.26389in;height:9in"
alt="Image 26" /></p>
<p>Interacting with a Person with an Intellectual Disability</p>
<p>• Keep the workout space small and preferably well known to the
individuals.</p>
<p>(For example a workout done in a large gym may be overwhelming)</p>
<p>• They may easily lose focus or get off task. It may be beneficial to
keep a visible schedule or list of things you will be doing that
day.</p>
<p>• It may help to allow them access to a preferred location or object
during the interview. For example they may prefer one specific piece of
exercise equipment you can use that piece as a reward when they complete
something you have asked them to do.</p>
<p>• Ask one question at a time. Explain new activities one step at a
time. Make sure they understand what you have said before you move on.
Don’t allow them to just say yes they understand.</p>
<p>• Keep communication simple. Rephrase comments or questions as
needed, using different words the second or third time, to clarify.</p>
<p>• Allow the person time to tell or show you what he or she wants.</p>
<p>When Working with an Athlete with a Disability</p>
<p>• Treat the athlete the same as an athlete without a disability.</p>
<p>• Have a basic understanding of the sport and any equipment used for
the sport. (and if you don’t know –just ask.</p>
<p>• Understand the different levels and types of disability sport
competition.</p>
<p>Remember</p>
<p>Our own beliefs and comfort level regarding disabilities have a major
impact on how we view, interact, and provide services to individuals
with disabilities.</p>
