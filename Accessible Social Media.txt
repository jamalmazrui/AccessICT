Profile Tips

•      []
Don’t use text in banner art images.

Outside of your organizational name, assistive technology cannot recognize text in your banner photo. Only use text in text fields.

•      Use high resolution images.

Images should be easy to see no matter how big they are viewed.

•      Use text colors that can easily be seen.

When possible, choose good contrast between text and background. Use an  online contrast checker such as  https://contrastchecker.com/ to verify  your colors.

•      List a point of contact.

For business profiles, list a point of contact to address questions.

•      Add alt text to images.

When this is not possible, describe images in clear, concise terms as part of the post. This includes images, tables, and charts. If there is text in your image, repeat it in your post.

•      Place hyperlinks at the end of the post.

Let people read your message before providing the link. Consider adding [PIC], [VIDEO], [AUDIO], or [PDF] before hyperlinks to help the reader know where they are going.

•      Use CamelCase for hashtags.

[]
Capitalizing the first letter in each word of your hashtag improves readability for people with low literacy, language fluency, or cognitive disabilities; users of screen reading software; and even readers who are just in a rush. Using CamelCase also makes your hashtags easier to decipher so that your audience interprets them correctly.

•      Ensure multimedia is accessible.

Any video you create or link to must have captioning. Podcasts must have transcripts. When writing a script, describe key visuals.

•      Use plain language.

Clear content will engage more readers. Avoid acronyms.
