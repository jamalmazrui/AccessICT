<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:15.4pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Technology has the power to create a more just and
inclusive society by providing greater autonomy, safety, economic opportunity,
and convenience for historically marginalized groups. However, all too often,
technology instead exacerbates existing discrimination and the structural
barriers faced by historically marginalized groups, including people of color,
women, and people with disabilities, and especially those who experience
intersecting forms of oppression.<sup><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Undertaken as a collaboration between the American
Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) and the Center for Democracy and
Technology (CDT) with the support of Freedman Consulting, this report is
intended to help public interest organizations do more inclusive, effective
work at the intersection of technology and disability issues in the United
States. Based on conversations with 20 disability and technology leaders, this
report will explore issue areas and ways where technology justice organizations
can better integrate a disability lens into their work. In addition, issues
surfaced in this report may help disability groups identify meaningful
opportunities to engage on technology policy issues and advance their
often-long-standing priorities. Along with identifying policy issues at the
intersection of disability and technology, this report will also highlight the
challenges and needs that must be addressed in order to break down barriers
between siloed fields and do more effective work.</p>

<div class=WordSection4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Historically, technology has played a significant role in
improving the quality of life, and in certain instances, longevity, for many
disabled people. This report is not meant to contest or stand in denial of that
reality. In taking an intersectional approach, this paper aims to ensure that
the pursuit of technologies to create opportunity and lower barriers for some
does not create inequities or limitations for others. Technology has great
potential to improve life and autonomy for people with disabilities, but it
also requires equitable and inclusive development, thoughtful, responsive
implementation and oversight, and a commitment to identifying and mitigating
harms to already-marginalized communities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;

draw on expert interviews and supplemental research, all of which were

</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc73556">II. Cross-Cutting Themes</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In interviews conducted for this report, stakeholders
raised four topics repeatedly across all issue areas, bridging concerns of the
disability and technology policy communities. These areas include: </p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>A. Inescapable Technology</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The role of technology in our lives is inescapable and
grows more and more prominent every day. In order to advocate for inclusive and
just technology – as our world continues to advance and concretize many
technological changes – a consistent examination of how technology affects
disabled people must be undertaken. Technology, and its corresponding benefits
and harms, exists in and now also shapes all spheres of life including housing,
healthcare, school, and work. The discussion of policy issue areas in this
report seeks to lift up how technology is, and can be, especially present and
harmful in the lives of disabled people.</p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>B. Accessibility as Crucial Issue</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Technology has the potential to change many disabled
peoples’ experiences in removing communication and interaction barriers in the
physical world. Therefore accessibility on the internet, to devices, in
applications, and in many related contexts, as well as all of their benefits
(and corresponding harms, many of which will be lifted up throughout this
report) must be primary to any conversation or work surrounding technology
policy and civil rights.</p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>C. Importance of Representation and Diversity in Technology Development
and Policy</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Today, algorithms and machine learning systems are used to
make decisions in some of the most important spheres of our daily life:
government services, employment, commerce, health, housing, immigration, and
the criminal and civil legal system. Without diverse design perspectives,
algorithms are trained by unrepresentative data/ information sets that can
reflect historical inequalities and biases.</p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>D. Algorithmic Bias and Inability to Capture Disability Experience</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.6pt;margin-bottom:36.95pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In addition to this lack of diverse representation, several
interviewees emphasized the fundamental inability of algorithms to even capture
the full diversity of disability experience and expression.  Or in other words,
the experiences, needs, and barriers that marginalized communities face,
including disabled people, who, by definition, cannot be quantified neatly.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc73557">III. Issue Areas</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>While technology is nearly inescapable in all aspects of
life today, our research identified nine areas in which the intersections
between technology and disability are of particular concern.</p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>A. Access to High-Speed Internet and Devices</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The internet has become vital to finding and obtaining
employment, full inclusion in education, utilizing basic services such as
banking, and simply staying connected to the outside world and our communities.
However, not only are people with disabilities – particularly those of color –
less likely to have the internet at home, but some evidence suggests they are
less likely to even use it at all. Challenges include high costs of services
and lack of accessible and affordable devices. </p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>B. Economic Security</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Technology is playing a growing role in obtaining and
maintaining economic security, and advancing economic security lies at the
center of the disability community’s advocacy work. People with disabilities
are about twice as likely to live in poverty than people without disabilities.
Accordingly, many disabled people rely on government income and benefits
support such as SSI, SSDI and SNAP, among other programs. Technology today
increasingly mediates access to these essential supports and can reinforce preexisting
disparities. Automated decision-making – driven by biased or faulty algorithms
– can deny disabled people benefits to which they are legally entitled, while
unjust tenant screening algorithms may limit access to affordable housing.</p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>C. Equitable Employment</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.45pt;margin-bottom:
18.55pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Equitable access to gainful employment, hiring
programs, workforce development, and government benefits and services are
necessary to an inclusive society that maintains economic security,
opportunity, and dignity for all. As our economy becomes increasingly reliant
on technology for these systems, many people with disabilities are at an
immediate disadvantage and face labor market discrimination as a result. Hiring
algorithms, workplace algorithmic management, and gig economy policies all
present challenges to disabled people.</p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>D. Privacy and Commercial Data Practices</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The United States lacks a baseline federal privacy law, so
state and sectoral privacy laws serve as a patchwork system that provides the
primary forms of data privacy protections enjoyed by most adults. However,
these laws often do not contain explicit anti-discrimination protections or
effective enforcement provisions. This lack of regulation of commercial data
leaves everyone vulnerable to harm; historically marginalized groups, including
people of color and people with disabilities, are even more at risk. Of
particular concern for people with disabilities are Internet of Things (IoT)
systems and biometric privacy issues. </p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>E. Amplifying Hate Speech and Issues of Free Expression</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.6pt;margin-bottom:18.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>For many, online platforms are the pre-eminent public
space. Yet, the reach of platforms also evokes unanswered free expression
questions, requiring more work to protect civil rights online. Given the
centrality of platforms to modern life and the disparate harms disabled
individuals face, building an online environment that is truly inclusive of and
equitable for people with disabilities requires a serious commitment to
addressing these challenges. Potential focal topics include content moderation,
free expression, and dis/ misinformation (especially focused on voter
suppression). </p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>F. Education and Student Surveillance</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Today, law enforcement, immigration and customs officers,
and now even public school administrators, are using a wide array of
surveillance technology purchased from private vendors. These surveillance
technologies include social media monitoring, student threat assessment
software management, and e-proctoring tools. These technologies can facilitate
discrimination based on racism and ableism and ultimately lead to disciplinary
action including suspension and/or expulsion from school for children with disabilities,
a disproportionate share of whom are students of color either designated as or
truly disabled.</p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>G. Law Enforcement</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Many interviewees asserted that disabled people, and
disproportionately disabled people of color, are over-surveilled, policed, and
criminalized by law enforcement agencies. The abuse of technology by policing
and immigration institutions can create new avenues to power (and potential
abuse of power) that replicate and amplify existing systems of oppression –
locking many people with disabilities out of equal opportunity and access to
their civil rights, while continuing to criminalize and surveill mental health.
Issues of concern included facial and gait recognition, predictive policing and
risk assessments, border screening, and video remote interpreting.</p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>H. Healthcare</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Similarly to education, criminal justice, and other parts
of our societal infrastructure, healthcare has also introduced technology as a
means to improve efficiency and improve outcomes. This approach can carry
significant consequences, however. Artificial intelligence has been
increasingly utilized by the healthcare industry in recent years, but like
other forms of AI, can and does result in bias affecting marginalized groups,
including people with disabilities. While healthcare technology is evolving at
a rapid pace, the growth of telehealth (which often is inaccessible for those
with disabilities or otherwise unable to access internet at home), algorithmic
management of care decisions, and the fundamental lack of transparency
regarding health data all represent significant areas of concern.</p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>I. Emerging Tech</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:31.95pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Emerging technologies have created greater opportunities
for independence for disabled people, as well as more channels and methods of
communication. It is vital that new technological tools are designed and
regulated through a truly inclusive technology justice lens, with the
disability community’s active participation. Emerging technology issues
highlighted by interviewees included autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and
automated speech recognition technology. </p>

technology justice. By exploring the wide range of work already taking place at
the nexus of these issues, identifying areas ripe for further examination and
highlighting existing challenges and field-building needs, this research is
intended to serve not as a blueprint, but as a conversation starter to advance
systematic efforts to build a more inclusive, coordinated, and effective public
interest community. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;

identifying the more nuanced questions, tools, resources, policies, and –
perhaps most importantly – relationships needed to do technology and disability
policy work that uplifts all. Supporting those working to ensure disabled
people can use technology to fully participate in their own and our shared
communities, achieve greater economic security, and flourish in our society
while being protected from harm moves us closer to realizing the promise of human
and civil rights in action.<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

discrimination and creates new threats to human and civil rights for
historically marginalized groups, including people of color, women, immigrants,
people with disabilities, and others, especially those who experience multiple,
intersecting forms of oppression. Those in positions of power can abuse
personal data and artificial intelligence to discriminate at a greater scale
that was not feasible before. Algorithms used to screen tenants or run the

discrimination against people with disabilities – effectively locking </p>

A Nuanced Understanding</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:98.2pt'>Historically, technology has played a significant role in
improving the quality of life, and in certain instances, longevity, for many
disabled people. The current wave of data-driven technological innovation is
transforming how we live, work, and play. The rapid pace of change, however,
calls for thoughtful reflection on the effect of these changes, particularly
for disabled people still struggling to be recognized as equal and visible
members of our society. Echoing perspectives similar to others interviewed for
this report, one disability rights leader emphasized that the net impact of
technology has been positive for their community. “Technology creates
opportunities for people with disabilities and breaks down barriers,” this
expert declared. For example, screen readers for blind individuals, video chat
and automated captioning for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, and voice
recognition technology allow people with certain disabilities greater autonomy
in their home. These are just a few examples of technology producing benefits
for people with disabilities. This report is not meant to contest or stand in
denial of that reality.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:98.2pt'>Instead, this report intends to help develop a nuanced
disability and technology policy agenda, one that identifies and mitigates real
risks, even as it celebrates benefits. This nuanced technology policy approach
aims to capture both the benefits of technology for people with disabilities,
while also highlighting the need to prevent and address discrimination and
other harmful applications. Building from the work of countless others, this
report equips advocates and researchers with a potential landscape of harms at
the intersection of technology and disability, as well as opportunities to
address them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In taking an intersectional approach, this report aims to
ensure that the pursuit of technologies to create opportunity and lower
barriers for some does not simultaneously create inequities or limitations for
others. Technology has great potential to improve life and autonomy for people
with disabilities, but it also requires equitable, inclusive development, as
well as thoughtful, responsive implementation and oversight, and a commitment
to identifying and mitigating harms to already-marginalized communities.<br

diverse set of preferred ways to describe disability status and identity. Some
individuals and organizations preferred “identity-first” language (e.g.,
disabled person), while others preferred “person-first” language (e.g., person
with disabilities). Resolving these long-standing discussions is beyond the
scope of this report. In addition, some experts considered themselves part of a
disability rights movement, while others framed their work in terms of<a

some of the challenges faced in defining disability in a uniform and consistent
fashion. This report also later discusses issues interviewees raised about
disability status, identity, and the diversity of perspectives on these topics.</p>

grows more and more prominent every day. One advocate noted how apparent
technology’s role has become due to COVID-19, especially for members of the
disability community: “Navigating the online system – vaccines, government
programming – we’re seeing different ways that tech tries to enforce a pace of
living and way of interacting based on assumptions around how people function
that do not work for how disabled people function.” Yet, another advocate also
cited the events of the COVID-19 pandemic as having increased virtual options
for people with disabilities in improving access to healthcare and civic events
like town hall meetings, and creating new educational opportunities.
Technology, and its corresponding benefits and harms, exists in and now also
shapes all spheres of life including housing, healthcare, school, and work.

Technology has the potential to change many disabled people’s experiences in

one disability rights leader explained, technology “has so much potential, but
if technology doesn’t address accessibility and disability, it also has the
potential to recreate existing barriers, exacerbate barriers, or create new
barriers.” Basic accessibility to the internet and devices is still a pressing

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;

its benefits (and its corresponding harms, many of which will be referenced
throughout this report) must be primary to any conversation or work surrounding
technology policy and civil rights. This same disability rights leader
underscored this primacy, declaring, “Still having to insist that accessibility
needs to be present within a number of tech applications and tools, it becomes
hard to engage in a next level conversation when you still can’t access the
application in question in the first place.” Advocating for stronger
accessibility has long been a priority for many working on disability issues,
and it is an issue rich with needs and opportunities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.0pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Today, algorithms and machine learning systems are used to
make decisions in some of the most important spheres of our daily life:
government services, employment, commerce, health, housing, immigration, and
the criminal and civil legal systems. One disability justice leader describes
the algorithm’s role as: “ubiquitous – renting, food stamps, hiring, decisions
about whether or not you are allowed out on bail . . . Algorithms affect every
part of our lives.” Yet, the technology and design sector, where these systems
and tools are created, is not representative of today’s daily life as it
continues to be dominated by white men.<a

diverse design perspectives, and especially when algorithms are trained on
unrepresentative datasets that reflect historical biases, inequitable outcomes
are less likely to be anticipated and mitigated. Argued one advocate, “We also
know from work by technologists, public policy experts, and activists that
systems of oppression in society are baked into these algorithms.”</p>

Inability to Capture Disability Experience</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:31.35pt'>In addition to this lack of representation, several
interviewees emphasized the fundamental inability of algorithms to even capture
the full diversity of disability experience and expression. Said one disability
rights scholar, “Disability is not well defined from a data perspective – the
only common characteristic is sufficient difference from the norm . . . Bias
detection systems do not detect bias against diverse, variable populations in
flux.” Compared to other characteristics like race, gender or education level,
disability is much harder to account for in code, the expert argued, given the
wide array of disabilities. Or in other words, the experiences, needs and
barriers that marginalized communities face, including disabled people, by
definition cannot be quantified neatly, causing traditional “bias auditing”
efforts to fail. Some interviewees argued that the bias contained in artificial
intelligence technology is inherent, thus creating an even greater need for
collaborative approaches to combat and lessen the potential harms baked into
these systems. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:31.35pt'>Many interviewees emphasized how algorithms serve to make
decisions based on a perceived “normal,” and this focus inherently marginalizes
individuals with disabilities. One technology justice advocate explained the
dual danger of these algorithms in diminishing rights to positive and negative
liberty: “Really anywhere that algorithms are deterministic, anyone who is not
normative will be more harshly impacted or will not be able to get access to
what they need.” The decision-making power of these biased tools can and does
have a disparate impact on historically marginalized groups, perpetuating and
amplifying racism, sexism, ageism, and ableism. One technology policy advocate
described the dangers of this technology, “There are very broad implications
and intersections with white supremacy in how technology defines a normative
range/ideal and compares everyone to it.” A disability expert, however,
cautioned that these challenges around “normal” should be viewed in a wider,
historical context. “Even before algorithms, concepts of normal have been used
to oppress and bias systems and policies against disabled people and other
historically excluded groups,” this individual noted.</p>

combination of a lack of affordable accessible devices and highspeed internet
can also lead to the harm of greater surveillance, especially for low-income

that has access to you. When you only have access through mobile phones, it is
much more likely to be tracked and surveilled.”</p>

are even more at risk. Personal data can often act as a proxy for race, gender,
income, age, and disability, enabling explicit and implicit discrimination
alike. People with disabilities’ use of platforms and other technologies can
create a digital footprint leading to targeting, discrimination, exclusion, or
the misuse of sensitive medical data. </p>

location data, exposing them to potential targeting, but this data also
provides new means to independence. One disability advocate explained, “Members
of our community are accustomed to revealing intimate details about our lives,
bodies, and minds to get access to resources that meet our basic needs. Our
relationship to privacy is very different from a community that does not live
that reality every day.” In the work to shape and pass much needed
comprehensive federal privacy legislation, it will be essential to grapple with
the unique needs of the disabled community.</p>

moderation tools. The COVID-19 pandemic <a

when platforms use AI in content moderation, marginalized groups are often

the training data that companies use is under-inclusive of people with
disabilities. AI will not learn to meet the needs of that population,” and “it
can’t handle context well,” this expert said. When an algorithm makes the
initial decision to flag posts and accounts are removed or suspended, it is
particularly difficult to determine why the posts were flagged or get them
reinstated. When Facebook sent their human content moderators home during the
pandemic, the number of successful content appeals went from 2.3 million in the
first quarter to 12,600 for the second quarter. Advocates questioned whether

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:9.7pt'>Today law enforcement, immigration and customs officers, and
now even public school administrators are using a wide array of surveillance
technology purchased from private vendors. These surveillance technologies
include social media monitoring and student threat assessment management
software, which can facilitate discrimination based on racism and ableism and
ultimately lead to disciplinary action including suspension and/or expulsion
from school. These tools purport to identify students who are at risk of
committing violent acts or self-harm, but<a

exacerbate disparities. One disability justice leader explained how school
surveillance tools specifically amplify those disciplinary measures that affect
disabled students, and in particular disabled students of color: “Because we
know from previous circumstances that discipline falls on marginalized students
– the monitoring will most likely have a similar impact.” </p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Healthcare is one of the systems many people interact with
on a regular basis. Similarly to education, criminal justice, and other parts
of our societal infrastructure, healthcare has also introduced technology as a
means to improve efficiency and outcomes. This approach can carry significant
consequences, however. Artificial intelligence has been increasingly utilized
by the healthcare industry in recent years, but like use in other areas, can
and does result in bias affecting marginalized groups, including people with
disabilities. “Companies will hide [AI] behind trade secrets and HIPAA. There
is a need to figure out if companies are being honest,” said one advocate,
noting the lack of transparency in the health industry’s use of AI and the
corresponding danger. “a lot of what tech companies have said about
auditability was false.” AI bias in healthcare is particularly alarming in the
context of disability rights because depending on individual health conditions
and medical needs, some people with disabilities must rely on and interact with
the healthcare system on an extremely frequent basis, and for some, as a means
of survival and ability to perform daily functions. As a result of this
interconnected relationship between disability and healthcare, AI- and other
technology-driven harms within the medical and health-related fields can have
particularly devastating results for disabled people. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>One of the ways in which these harms manifest is through
the use of algorithms. Algorithmic decision-making systems are used in
healthcare settings to make treatment decisions, guide or limit care, as well
as inform other high-stakes decisions that directly impact patient care. As one
disability rights expert expressed, “Algorithms and [their] impact is
inescapable.” When these automated tools intersect with<a

href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/"><span
style='color:#2B2A2A;text-decoration:none'>,</span></a> their harmful impact
can be compounded further. As discussed in other sections of this report,
algorithms (and AI, more broadly) generally do not capture disability well. The
vast diversity among people with disabilities requires nuance and individualized
approaches, which runs counter to the nature of algorithmic decisions within
healthcare. </p>

this represents a 350-fold increase as compared to pre-pandemic levels. This
growth reflects both greater participation rates among patients, as well as
expanded Medicare coverage to include telehealth visits. The expanded use of,
and need for, telehealth visits as a result of COVID-19, results in obvious
barriers for many in the disability community, based on the need for greater
accessibility and disability-centered design within the technology sector. Many
disabled people are simply unable to use tech platforms and programs because
they weren’t built with disability in mind, in addition to lack of broadband
access and other socioeconomic circumstances that limit tech usage and are
overrepresented among people with disabilities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.85pt;margin-bottom:

by medical providers may benefit some with disabilities, particularly those
whose primary condition limits mobility, this can also create barriers for
others within the disability community, especially those with sensory
impairments. One disability rights expert stated, “Telehealth has been a big
issue, especially [in the context of] disability and low-income [status]. Who
has access and what communication access is built into these systems?” They
continued by explaining that most medical providers use their own private
platform, most of which do not allow for a third screen. This setup effectively
eliminates the ability for a deaf or hard-of-hearing person to use an
interpreter, which unless the medical provider happens to know sign language,
renders them unable to take part in telehealth appointments. Videobased
telehealth services also carry similar limitations for others with
vision-related disabilities, as well as some with intellectual disabilities. </p>

actors within the healthcare system, oftentimes without patients even being
aware. For example, many hospitals and healthcare providers rely on databases
that attempt to measure a patient’s risk level in regard to prescribing
controlled substances, namely opioid pain medications. Data is collected from
hospitals, pharmacies and other providers within the healthcare system,
resulting in the equivalence of a credit score assigned to a patient, with the
intent to flag harmful behaviors such as “doctor shopping” or other indicators
of prescription abuse. This can result in negative and disparate impacts on
individuals with disabilities, particularly those with conditions requiring
ongoing pain management. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;

risk-prediction algorithms. For example, a<a

an algorithm used nationwide and applied to an estimated 200 million people in
the U.S. each year – and found it improperly assessed health needs for some
marginalized individuals. This particular algorithmic tool aims to flag for
hospitals and insurance companies patients who need high-risk care management
with the hope that by doing so, they can reduce costs and preemptively prevent
more serious and costly medical interventions. To determine which patients
should qualify for this high-risk care, the algorithm used previous health
spending as a proxy for medical needs. However, the study revealed that this
was a faulty metric. White patients were found to have higher medical expenses
related to preventative care, while Black patients more often had lower medical
expenses due to several factors, from fewer accessible medical interventions to
distrust in the overall healthcare system. Black patients had substantially
greater health care needs than white patients who were assigned to the same
levels of risk. “The authors estimated that this racial bias reduces the number
of Black patients identified for extra care by more than half,” according to an
abstract published in Science. “The bias arises because the algorithm predicts

margin-left:14.0pt'>Although this particular study focused on racial
discrimination – which is not mutually exclusive with disability status – it is
reasonable to suggest that people with disabilities may also be similarly
impacted by lack of transportation access, strain on the doctor-patient
relationship, and distrust in the healthcare system. These impacts may act as
proxies that inaccurately measure disabled people’s health risks, given the
healthcare services they utilize – like the Black patients in this study – may likely
differ from those without disabilities. And as a result, fail to be properly
identified or classified by healthcare algorithms intended to improve care,
because they are ultimately designed with white, non-disabled patients as the
norm.</p>

margin-left:12.75pt;text-indent:-13.5pt'>• <span style='color:#343433'>Lack of
data transparency:</span> Another source of concern for some in the disability
rights community is the lack of transparency regarding health-related data, as
well as the lack of information and regulation surrounding large-scale
databases that store individual patient data. As illustrated by the opioid and
health needs risk assessment tools listed above, the data that underlie these
systems directly inform decisions at various points in the healthcare system,
which has resulted in concern within the disability justice space considering
the potential for disparate negative impacts on disabled individuals who must
interact with healthcare providers and systems on an intensive and frequent
basis due to their disability needs or medical condition(s). </p>

nationwide privacy framework. Although HIPAA has governed the availability and
usage of some health-related information obtained by medical providers and
insurance companies, there is a substantial contingency of health data, largely
fueled by advancements in technology, that falls outside of the scope of HIPAA
protections. For example, data collected from wearable devices, cell phones and
other “smart” devices. The applications on these devices track enormous amounts
of information regarding user’s mental and physical health, spanning from daily
eating and exercise habits to highly personal information regarding menstrual

“smart” technology was largely protected by HIPAA and other privacy laws, but
is now largely unregulated – is collected in databases accessible to some
private and public sector bodies, the way in which this data is used, shared,
and otherwise utilized remains largely unclear. And more broadly, because these
algorithms are used by private healthcare providers, even the limited

not necessarily available to provide accountability. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Emerging technologies have created greater opportunities
for independence for disabled people, as well as more channels and methods of
communication. It is vital that new technological tools are designed and
regulated through a truly inclusive technology justice lens, with the
disability community’s active participation. This approach is necessary so this
“progress” does not contribute to the harms highlighted throughout this report
– like breaches of data privacy, targeted harassment, and over-surveillance –
but rather contributes to a more inclusive and just world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>One example of these developments is automated captioning,
which has significantly increased accessibility to all types of programming.
However, the automation used in these technologies is imperfect and can
perpetuate continued inequity. Advocates also expressed concern that some
individuals also wrongly deem this emerging technology as a panacea for any/all
accessibility needs, reducing momentum for more effective solutions. “It
happens all the time – I request interpreters, and they say, ‘We will do automated
captions,’” one disability leader explained. “You need to make sure that it is
the right sound quality, the right voice . . . so in most situations, it is
actually not highly accurate.” Another disability leader raised the potential
surveillance and discrimination harms automated captioning could exacerbate,
noting, “If the algorithm picks up that this person has an accent or an
impediment and then profiles them, what do we do?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>One disability advocate explained the tension between how
helpful this technology can be and the dangers of people seeing it as a cure
all to any accessibility or other concerns, “So we are working on convincing
folks that just because the technology is there doesn’t mean it’s the right fit
or the real, full access.” For example, many of these emerging technologies are
designed to be speechrecognition based, which creates barriers to access for
the Deaf community. </p>

other professionals engage on many tech issues affecting the disabled
community, our interviews surfaced a need for greater collaboration in order to
make technology systems, tools, and policies more inclusive. Without minimizing
the existing work disability justice professionals and advocates have
undertaken in the technology space, interviewees suggested significant
challenges remain on both the tech and disability rights side. One civil rights
leader also underscored the challenge and opportunity inherent throughout this
body of work. “Whatever philanthropy does, it has to think about the ways in
which the entire philanthropy system underpays marginalized communities for the
benefit of the entire nation,” this individual said. This leader highlighted

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.85pt;margin-bottom:
13.45pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>A series of persistent challenges that many
stakeholders identified relate to accessibility. While accessibility in the
context of disability historically refers to creating physical spaces that are
accessible to everyone, access to digital technology is emerging as a new
frontier in the fight for civil rights. As one disability expert stated:
“Technology has so much potential, but if technology doesn’t address
accessibility and disability, it also has the potential to recreate or
exacerbate existing barriers, and even create new barriers.” Interviewees
argued that work on technology and disability justice must often start with
accessibility but cannot end there. Aspects of challenges related to
accessibility included: </p>

there is often an inherent tension in technology and disability work that can

find it difficult or impossible to engage with it. Without basic accessibility
concerns addressed by the technology sector first, some interviewees expressed
that there is often little ability or incentive for disability groups to engage
on other harms technology creates for their community. This inaccessibility
also results in less external pressure on the technology sector to incorporate
accessibility across platforms and systems as a function of their design.

other priorities:</span> Relatedly, several interviewees suggested that
generally, disability organizations are the main stakeholders focused on
accessibility and as a result, lack bandwidth to take on other
technologyrelated issues. This disconnect has led some in the disability
justice space to express the sentiment that “since no one else is creating
accessibility in tech, we have to.” Some disability rights experts acknowledged
that serving as the de facto leader on accessibility makes sense, given their
expertise, but it can also limit the ability for disability groups and
individuals to engage more broadly on other tech issue areas and develop tech
expertise outside of accessibility. There is a need for technology justice
groups and other allies to elevate and put resources behind the issue of
digital accessibility. Amplification of this issue will be necessary both so
this work does not just fall to a few disability groups and to create a pathway
for disability groups to engage in other technology justice work. Until there
is more support for this issue, one advocate said, “Still having to insist that
accessibility needs to be present within a number of tech applications and
tools . . . it becomes hard to engage in a next level conversation when you
still can’t access the application in question in the first place.” </p>

centered on accessibility is harmful:</span> Interviewees suggested that while
accessibility is a vital factor in creating the “even playing field” required
to even begin addressing disparate harms, it is overly reductive to conclude
that accessibility is at the core of the disability rights movement with
respect to technology. In interviews, many expressed resistance to the notion
that disabled communities and their fight for civil rights in technology be
defined solely or even primarily by accessibility. As such, this report
acknowledges the crucial need for accessible forms of tech, while also
illustrating the various ways in which tech must be more inclusive beyond just
reasons of accessibility, as well as other disparate outcomes and harms
experienced by disabled people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.8pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Several interviewees also identified that
disability-centered organizations and member groups must often balance the
immediate and most pressing needs of their diverse members; and as a result,
technology is not often prioritized. “One of the tricky balances that you have
as a member organization or a disability organization is if you have members
who are reaching out saying, ‘I need X and Y,’ you will prioritize housing,
food security, and accessible transportation,” said one leader working on
disability issues. “I would be shocked if one of the major disability
organizations had people reaching out saying I am worried Google is tracking
me.” Another disability advocate argued that “disability rights organizations
miss the vast majority of disabled people, who are the most likely to have been
homeless, incarcerated, incompetent-presumed, or institutionalized,” making it
less likely issues affecting these populations are prioritized generally. </p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:

misunderstanding of technology harms and remedies</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Many interviewees emphasized the disability community is
not a monolith, despite often being perceived as such. These experts instead
highlighted a wide array of disability identities and emphasized that many
individuals with a disability may not even consider themselves disabled. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The misconceptions that surround what it means to have a
disability are a challenge to bridging this gap between technology and
disability justice as well as doing truly inclusive work to the benefit of all.
Interviewees explained that sometimes a “win” for some in the disability sphere
can constitute a setback for others, given that the vast diversity amongst
individuals warrants equally diverse and nuanced solutions, rather than a
one-size-fits-all approach. For example, one leader of a disability organization
noted that ridesharing systems were a convenient and more affordable
transportation option for deaf and blind users, but undermined significant
progress in the fight for wheelchair accessible transportation.</p>

learning text moderation model to classify content as “more toxic.” “Systems
used to determine bias may work for bounded identity groups,” said one disability
expert, but cautioned that disability status was not well-defined in a rigid
data context. For example, if a tool is declared bias-free based only on
metrics related to race, it will allow the tool to continue perpetuating
disability discrimination unchecked. It might even lift the burden of
accountability from those using the AI since they </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>can claim to have conducted a bias audit. One disability
rights leader explained, “Companies are being approved and certified as not
having bias, but that doesn’t hold for disability at all. That is a pattern
that happens quite frequently.” </p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>4. Limited representation of individuals with disabilities</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Engagement with disability rights groups and others may not
necessarily include hearing directly from people with disabilities and gaining
from their firsthand, lived experience of the ways in which tech has not been
accessible or benefitted them. Several experts highlighted representation more
broadly, including the need for a greater number of people with disabilities
holding leadership and otherwise positions of power, both within disability
justice organizations and ideally, also within tech spaces. As one technology
justice advocate stated: “Are we actually talking to the people that are
impacted by this and finding a nuanced approach that accounts for those
practical needs?” “As far as I can tell, there are [very few people] who are
openly disabled working at the nexus of disability and tech from a civil rights
perspective,” said a disabled advocate. A priority should be “deliberately
inviting to the table and centering in conversations disabled people from
multiply marginalized communities who are least likely to be invited,” this
individual argued. Given stigmatization of disability in many fields, ensuring
individuals feel safe about being open about their disability status may also
be a key need.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Several disability rights leaders recognized the tension of
consultation fatigue for many in the disability community who currently engage
in cross-over field work and are called upon frequently. Citing this concern,
many expressed the importance of balancing greater representation and hiring
more disabled people with the expectation that it is not these individuals’
jobs to fix or heal the need for greater accessibility and disability-centered
solutions within tech.  </p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>5. Shallow pool of professionals with experience in both
disability-focused accessibility and rights, as well as tech-specific expertise</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>What further complicates this is that just as tech systems
are built with inherent bias baked in because of a lack of representation and
awareness among those who construct the platforms we use every day, similarly,
the underrepresentation of disabled people among many disability rights
organizations’ leadership means that even if the tech and disability rights
sectors achieve greater cross-collaboration, it doesn’t necessarily mean that
the firsthand, lived experiences by those directly impacted by inaccessible and
otherwise biased tech systems, will be centered. And without centering these
voices and perspectives, the tech sector will potentially further incorporate
additional bias as a result of engagement with disability rights communities
that themselves are not directly informed by and centered on disabled people
and their inherent, lived expertise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Additionally many across both tech and disability rights
identified the widespread lack of disability experts embedded into tech
companies in paid positions. The limited pool of professionals with both tech
experience and a disability rights-orientation was widely acknowledged by
members of the disability rights community, many of whom identified the need
for pipelines, fellowships and funding for other opportunities to encourage
disability experts in tech positions, one of whom stated a desire for “money for
fellowship programs that prioritize disabled people [and disability experts]
and embed programs within tech.” Currently disability groups are working with
allies across the technology industry and academia to improve accessibility.<a

people with disabilities</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>As previously discussed in the report, this lack of basic
knowledge, in part reflects the lack of diversity and representation within the
tech field. But interviews conducted for this report revealed something more
nuanced: it is not only that tech is comprised primarily of white men and/or
individuals who may be less aware of disability justice and other civil rights
causes, but also that there is a true lack of opportunity for those in tech to
engage disability rights experts in meaningful and organic ways due to a lack
of knowledge of these harms. One technology justice advocate explained this
need for and lack of basic knowledge in the field, declaring, “I think
identifying where the issues are, where there is a nexus with disability” is
valuable. The individual continued this education could include saying, “Here
are practices that you are working on that have a disparate impact on
individuals with disabilities” or “These are the ways you need to think about
the disparate impact on individuals with disabilities.” While increasing
attention has been paid in recent years to algorithmic bias, and more
specifically risk assessments, the harm inherent for people with disabilities
has often not translated into a greater awareness and sense of accountability on
the technology side. Said another expert, “From top to bottom, tip to toes, we
are not doing good enough work to make sure that legislation or what we are
doing in comms is accessible and incorporating disability.”</p>

advocates</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:17.3pt;margin-bottom:
13.45pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Many interviewees highlighted a lack of connective
tissue and overlap between the tech and disability justice world. Several
experts interviewed identified a significant need for opportunities that
facilitate relationship-building. One tech expert expressed the need for
tech-oriented groups to engage, learn and listen to disability communities,
stating that this type of interaction with disability rights groups is “how we
actually change.” But illustrating the challenges creating these opportunities,

the organizations are that we could be partnering with. To what extent do these
organizations exist . . . and how can we build this shared understanding and
analysis?” </p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.45pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>8. Deeper-seated divisions between some civil rights organizations and
disability rights/justice organizations</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Another challenge identified by a number of interviewees in
the disability rights space are varying degrees of historical tension and
distrust between those in disability-centered spaces and other civil rights
groups. Today, civil rights groups range from modern-day movements such as
Black Lives Matter, which represents a new era and younger generation, as well
as historically prominent and highly visible groups, often referred to as
“legacy groups” that still hold a powerful and prominent space within civil
rights circles. Many of these legacy organizations served leading roles in some
of the most important civil rights wins and reforms in U.S. history, such as
the Voting Rights Act and other landmark wins that changed the course of
American history. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>However, some interviewees argued that historically,
disability rights were not central to many of these civil rights movements, nor
are disability-centered issues at the core of these groups’ efforts today.
These longer-standing divisions can serve as a practical barrier to further
work at the intersection of technology, disability, civil rights, and justice.
This gap has led some in disability justice groups to feel there are limited
opportunities for collaboration that elevates their disability-focused issue
areas and objectives, and therefore these groups may be less incentivized to
engage. Additionally, the nature of disability groups has changed over time,
according to a disability rights leader, who expressed that, as compared to the
1980’s and 1990’s with the passage of the ADA, many groups are smaller in size
and may specialize in specific issue areas within disability justice. This may
also contribute to challenges in bridging the gap between civil and disability
rights groups. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'>II. Needs and Opportunities</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.5pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Interviewees identified a wide set of needs and
opportunities, including:</p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.9pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>1. Resource commitment within technology justice organizations to true
inclusion</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Incorporating an initial plan for resource commitment from
technology justice organizations to include the disability perspective in
project design and scope will be imperative. For example, one interviewee noted
how Legal Aid organizations may act as a model for this work in how they
provide resources early on to individuals who can help them identify and
challenge unjust systems. On the other hand, one technology policy leader noted
how their organization had recently created a website to help individuals
access an important technology subsidy, but they did not have the resources to
do an accessibility audit of this website. Broadly, several interviewees
emphasized the need to orient themselves more fully toward both basic
accessibility practices and more deeprooted inclusion of disabled perspectives
in their work. “We don’t need a new suite of tools; we need a new suite of
mental facilities. When I [facilitate], we are not using those tools,” one
advocate said. “How are we making it so folks in disability justice can be a
part of a coalition, for us to make it a priority?” This individual emphasized
there was a fundamental need to rethink facilitation and engagement practices
to be inclusive of disabled people, rather than just adding technical tools and
considering the need met. </p>

<h4 style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:19.6pt;margin-bottom:16.45pt;margin-left:
-.25pt'>2. Funding for paid fellowships and other longterm opportunities for
people with disabilities and disability rights experts to contribute directly
to technology policy work</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:10.15pt;margin-bottom:
13.45pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Several technology justice advocates expressed the
desire for their organizations to support a position, grounded in experience,
dedicated to addressing disability throughout their portfolio of work. “You can
become experts, but really by finding ways for folks [with disabilities] to
help audit us [technology organizations] and find tools and resources that we
need,” said one interviewee. “It would be great if every major public interest
organization had a fellow . . . designed to bring this intentional thinking and
grounding to the work,” said another technology leader. “It is really important
having capacity built into the organization’s structure – there is no
substitute.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Many stressed the need for long-term oversight from the
disability perspective on technology advocacy, especially in regard to
advocating for regulation or drafting legislation. One disabled advocate said,
“Who will begin providing actual resources to disabled people at all career
levels to develop skills necessary to contribute at a leading level? I want to
see reallocation of resources.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.85pt;margin-bottom:
18.6pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>While there was near-universal agreement on the
importance of funding the work of disability experts (particularly disabled
individuals), many interviewees nonetheless warned of the risks associated with
relying on the placement of a few disability rights experts within public
interest organizations and companies as the solution to bridging this divide or
supporting true inclusion. While this representation is important, expectations
for those who do cross-sector work must be managed to avoid burnout and consultation
fatigue, interviewees warned, also noting that the panoply of disability
experiences makes it difficult for a small number of individuals to truly
represent all disabled people. </p>

rights advocacy perspective, but rather consist of non-experts who are
representative of groups the technology industry wishes to better address in
expanding accessibility into programs and systems. This need for opportunities
to expose tech professionals to candid stories and perspectives was suggested
by several experts, illustrating that many within tech are simply unaware of or
lack education on the barriers that individuals with disabilities face in
accessing and using various forms of technology. Hearing directly from a
diverse group of individuals sharing their perspectives, is likely an
opportunity that most professionals outside of the disability community simply
wouldn’t have, if not for structures in place like focus groups and listening
sessions. One technology advocate noted the importance of including a diversity
of disabled individuals affected by technology harms, “Efforts need to be in
compensating people from formal and informal orgs that represent disability
people at margins.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Interviewees emphasized the need for these listening
sessions to be paid opportunities, particularly given the barriers to
employment many disabled people face. By providing paid opportunities, disabled
participants and the technology and disability professionals these sessions
serve to educate and inform. Multiple experts in the disability rights space
indicated the scarcity of – but great need for – such opportunities, describing
alternative efforts by tech to benefit from the perspectives of disabled people
through unpaid, biased, tokenizing, or otherwise one-sided ways that overly
center the needs of technology companies or advocates. One leader elaborated
that people with disabilities are “often expected to give time, labor and
emotional energy without compensation, while our community is
disproportionately unemployed and impoverished.” They described this situation
as “not an environment that incentivizes participation.” In contrast, a
technology policy advocate offered an example where such a listening effort
would be beneficial: in an effort to improve the Medicaid Long Term Services
&amp; Supports program, this expert suggested efforts were needed on listening
and learning from disabled users, asking “What is it like experientially, what
was missing, what was wrong with it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:18.55pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Others expressed a tendency to overlook the value of
disabled perspectives and the experiences of this population altogether.
Illustrating the benefits the technology sector – and related public interest
community – can gain simply by providing paid opportunities that seek the
feedback and wisdom of people with disabilities, one disability justice leader
stated, “People closest to the problem have the solutions. It’s always better
to have a conversation with someone who is directly impacted.” “We’ve learned
that none of us is safe until all are. [We should be] beginning at the margins,
designing at the margins,” another disability expert argued. “Disability is a
horizontal condition that everyone will experience.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Most interviewees emphasized a need to build bridges
between these communities. This could include convenings and meetings whose
purpose is to create space and time for individuals and groups to connect, and
in doing so, build trust and crosscommunity relationships. As one expert said,
“You cannot do work with people who you don’t have relationships with. The
first strategy is to get to know one another. [There has to be] consistency and
respect; that doesn’t come quickly.” In exploring opportunities to create
collaboration, interviewees emphasized priorities including:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
style='color:#343433'>Building greater trust and respect:</span> To build
spaces that promote respect and trust, it is vital that both disability rights
and tech are equally and fully represented. One interviewee described this as
the need for “space and time to be in solidarity and meaningful relationship
with the disability community, making sure that it doesn’t overly center tech.”
Although there is a clear need for meetings that facilitate meaningful
relationship-building across tech and disability rights, these spaces can be
hard to come by. One disability rights expert noted: “There hasn’t been a lot
of connective tissue between advocates in the disability rights space and
advocates in the technology policy space; there is a lot of opportunity whether
it’s funders or organizations that set out to create more spaces for these
[tech and disability-focused] conversations at scale and in a facilitated and
constructive setting.” </p>

13.45pt;margin-left:14.0pt'>Some in the disability community shared that
opportunities and convenings may also serve to help clarify misconceptions or
misunderstandings others may have about disability groups, which left
unaddressed, can limit collaboration. “Many disability groups are largely
focused on [lived, personal] experience; people get overwhelmed [hearing this
array of vast and different experiences] and think the community isn’t
organized,” a disability rights expert expressed. “In reality, all of these
communities will have different experiences. [Tech] partners need to understand
that dynamic and to see how the community is organized.” This individual also
then shared a question tech groups can ask themselves when attempting to gain
better understanding of disability rights groups: “Are we actually talking to
the people who are working on this and [directly] impacted and finding a
nuanced approach that accounts for those practical needs?”</p>

– within the overarching disability and civil rights umbrella – and are not
necessarily focused on the same aspects of or issues pertaining to disability
rights. This divergence can limit the ability to galvanize and form widespread
support and organized efforts. One advocate expressed the need for more groups
across a wide array of communities to engage with disability-centered issues in
order to bring more attention. This work, the advocate argued, is particularly
necessary because across these groups, there is an incredible amount of
expertise and skill that can bolster unified efforts. They summarized this
desire and the inherent challenges in accomplishing this as: “All I want is for
us to think of these issues outside of silos.” This individual emphasized
reaching these goals would be an endeavor that should be focused on the long

“There are opportunities for the funder community to support spaces for

said one technology policy leader. “It could be a lot more knowledge and

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The voices, perspectives and expertise of those with
multiple marginalized identities – meaning those who in addition to being
disabled also belong to other disadvantaged and historically oppressed groups –
are often underrepresented, undervalued, or excluded altogether from meaningful
spaces in which disability rights leaders and decision-makers determine what
inclusive and disability-centered tech should look like. Several interviewees
noted this effect of multiple marginalization and the underrepresentation faced
by those belonging to more than one structurally disadvantaged group, is

margin-left:14.0pt'>disability rights experts argued that both disability
rights groups, as well those within the broader civil rights community,
generally do not approach their work in an intersectionality-mindful way,
despite the inherent overlap between the two. Because disabilities are present
across all demographic groups, every civil rights community – by definition –
has members with disabilities. The inverse is true for disability rights
communities. Yet this overlap is not always evident or reflected in these groups’
strategies and efforts, in part due to a lack of education, some interviewees
argued. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:14.0pt'>Building in this intersectional approach will require
greater education on why disability is relevant to all civil rights communities
and vice versa, and importantly, on how by incorporating these intersections
into their work, all groups can bolster their individual and collective
efforts. A disability rights advocate said, “It will take showing, for example,
the Latinx community what these tech harms look like for disabled members of
their community. The Latinx community has engaged a lot in special education;
[but] you can’t do education advocacy without having a strong emphasis on kids
with [special education status].” Additionally, some in the disability rights
space expressed the need for events and meetings designed with an
intersectional lens that promote learning and greater awareness for both the
tech sector and disability rights groups, for example a large-scale summit
centering the history of technology sector harms towards Black and brown
people, in addition to disabled Black and brown people. </p>

are centered and empowered:</span> Due to the nature of multiple
marginalization and the compounding disadvantage it creates, BIPOC and
otherwise marginalized members within the disability community arguably
experience the greatest barriers and harms brought on by tech, and yet they
have the least opportunity to have these perspectives heard by those with power
and influence, let alone have their needs reflected by these leaders’ efforts
in engaging tech, several interviewees noted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:14.0pt'>A disability rights advocate illustrated how this lack of
representation results in disparate tech harms for those most marginalized,
explaining that most disability rights organizations are overwhelmingly “white,
male, cisgender, [and] heterosexual.” The result, they argued, is that
individuals most likely to have been homeless, incarcerated, institutionalized,
reliant on public assistance, and otherwise experiencing severely disadvantaged
outcomes, are disparately impacted by tech harms in the form of law enforcement
surveillance and inaccessible public benefits platforms, for example. And yet
these experiences – and those who live them – are not typically elevated or
even present in decision-making and other meaningful spaces that serve to make
tech more inclusive. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:14.0pt'>Several disability rights professionals expressed that
unless the individuals most marginalized within the disability community are
actively sought out in an intentional, targeted manner to ensure they have an
equal seat at the table, their voices will simply go unheard. One expert
emphasized this point, saying, “Free registration for conferences is not the
answer; [we] need to sit down and have serious conversations about the harm
done to these people. Until we have some serious, honest conversations about
what is happening in the disability rights community, none of this will
change.” There is a need for funding and resources that incentivize the
inclusion of Black, brown and otherwise disadvantaged people within the
disabled community at events and meetings where policy development and
strategic decisions are made, including funding for the capacity to participate
in these endeavors. </p>

disabled people, and particularly those with multiple marginalized identities,
have been categorically excluded from educational and employment opportunities,
it is also important to create educational materials, and written texts
otherwise intended to inform others on tech and disability issues that are
accessible and easily understood. An example shared by a disability justice
leader is languagedecoding glossaries to accompany research and advocacy
materials, the purpose of which are to encourage the use of accessible language
among those utilizing these groups’ research and other communications
materials. The push for accessible and plainly written materials is in part to
ensure that the population disability rights groups aim to serve – those with
disabilities themselves – can actually access the information relevant to
disability justice and their lives. Additionally, there is an opportunity to
foster dialogue with the technology justice research community and the advocacy
community to help translate academic papers into information that is actionable
for local disability advocates. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;

technology and disability issues was illustrated by one expert who pointed to
variations in literacy frequently observed within the deaf and hard-of-hearing

and experiences among hearing-impaired children and adults, mean that some
within the deaf community may not have had the same exposure to, or emphasis
placed on, written language skills and written texts, as compared to many in
the hearing world. This example underscores the need for plain-language
documents and any other barriers that may exist based on the complexity of
experiences amongst disabled people which may impact their ability to consume
written materials intended to educate and promote disability rights,
particularly as they relate to complicated technical issues. “There is a really
steep learning curve,” on tech issues, said a disabled advocate. “I think that

issues. But in addition to a need for more funding across the board, some
expressed concerns that what limited funding currently does exist is not being

long-term investment and resources from academia and the private sector to
include the disability community, “Elite institutions don’t have a strong
record of recruiting or retaining disabled students or scholars. The pipeline
of centering disabled people is really limited.” As a growing and new area of
work, emerging tech could be an opportune area to focus on creating this
initial pipeline of crossdisability and technology experts. The goal of this

disabled professionals in tech, through streamlining a process through which

professionals, as well as members of the disability justice community
interviewed, was the need for greater education, awareness and understanding of
how disabled people engage in tech, experience barriers and harms, as well as
qualitative information in the form of stories and anecdotes to promote greater
awareness. As one advocate declared, “There is always a need for more research
about how different communities are using services, tech, and platforms. How
and where and why we might be falling [short] and failing to meet the needs of
communities.” Several other technology experts expressed the need for shared
language, common terminology across disabled and non-disabled groups in tech,
as well as a greater library of disabled tech user’s accounts of ways in which
tech has been inaccessible, hard to use, or harmful as a result of their
disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.8pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;

statistical significance and empirical evidence. You cannot reach that in terms
of a disability. There never is a large enough ‘n’ [number of

wide variety of problematic tech issues. They argued the landmark ADA’s
relatively lower standard of harm/evidence offered potential to advance
longstanding priorities for stakeholders in the. “The ADA doesn’t require quite
the same hurdles in many cases that other civil rights laws do,” said one

to make with population level data that are not usually required in the same

the same things that have a disparate impact based on race and other protected
characteristics.” A more comprehensive mapping of potential applications of
federal disability law challenges to tech harms, like algorithmic bias in
hiring, could advance advocacy work, especially as the Supreme Court may
clarify in coming years how public accommodations law applies to online
platforms. One advocate also emphasized the importance of state-based
disability and public accommodations laws.</p>

of the national disability organizations serve on consumer advisory committees
to major tech companies. There is an opportunity for the technology public
interest organizations to create toolkits and resource materials to better
equip these disability groups to raise issues and questions of concern on
technology harms, in addition to accessibility of products and services. For
example, a plain language tool kit that promoted ways to move the focus of a
conversation from AI fairness to AI justice could be useful to disability
leaders in their conversations with major technology companies. In addition to
these kinds of specific collaborations, resources for dedicated technical
capacity and expertise within disability organizations was identified as
another area of opportunity. “Philanthropy can make a much greater investment
in real technology issues and teach folks what to think about AI and how to
understand it within their issue area,” argued a technology justice leader,
emphasizing the importance of increasing dedicated technologist capacity to
inform advocacy on AI and other technical policy areas. “Having a technologist
at your organization makes a world of difference. Training people to be able to
do that is incredibly important.”</p>

disability issues explained, “Many disability advocates have no orientation,
let alone training, on what the existing policies are, and what the evolution
will be of tech policy.” To sustainably engage in this work, this individual
argued, disability leaders must be equipped not only with the knowledge of how

underscored this opportunity: “What is missing is a strategy and the means for
sustaining people with disabilities at the table, equipped with an
understanding of the technology, policy, and advocacy context they are in, and
of the time-sensitivity of this moment to influence future development of
inclusive technology.” Creating a space for mutual, ongoing support and
engagement between these trained members of the disability community would
enable connected and sustained work. This dedicated space for disability
advocates to routinely share lessons learned and provide mutual and ongoing

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:98.2pt'>Disability issues are fundamental to and inextricable from
the pursuit of technology justice. By exploring the wide range of work already
taking place at the nexus of these issues, identifying areas ripe for further
work and highlighting challenges and field-building needs, this research is
intended to serve not as a blueprint, but as a conversation starter to advance
systematic efforts to build a more inclusive, coordinated, and effective public
interest community. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:98.2pt'>Interviewees noted that technology companies often develop
misleading or superficial relationships with disability organizations to
promote a product line, not to address concerns from a disability perspective.
One disability leader explained, “Disability is often used as a mechanism to
whitewash a new technology.” Many disability advocacy communities are still
unaware of the issues and potential harms these tech companies may be creating
or are otherwise dependent on the technology companies for financial support.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:98.2pt'>If the work identified in this report is successful, we
should see this relationship change as a fuller public interest and technology
justice community form. One technology justice leader underscored this
potential: “At end of day, this work is changing people’s lives. We just need
to do it better.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:3.0pt;margin-bottom:13.45pt;
margin-left:98.2pt'>We are deeply grateful for the generosity of those who
offered their time to participate in interviews and/or developed the extensive
body of research and advocacy on which this report relies. Without their
insights and leadership, this report would not have been possible. Any errors
or oversimplifications are ours alone. </p>

for identifying the more nuanced questions, tools, resources, policies, and –
perhaps most importantly – relationships needed to do technology policy work
that uplifts all. Supporting those working to ensure disabled people can use
technology to fully participate in their community, achieve greater economic
security, and flourish in our society while being protected from harm moves us
closer to making real the promise of human and civil rights.</p>
