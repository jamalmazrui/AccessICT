Accessibility Testing Criteria for iOS Applications version 1.0: August 2016 
__________________________________________________ 
 
Introduction  

 
Context and Background 
 
This set of Accessibility Testing Criteria is intended to be used to check the accessibility of an application for users with impairments in one or more categories of vision, colour perception, hearing, speech, dexterity, cognition on an iOS device.  
 
The basis for this is built on input from a number of sources including: o Mobile Manufacturers Forum GARI website, o W3C WCAG 2.0 recommendations on accessibility, o Apple developer site recommendations on accessibility, o AT&T recommendation on website accessibility, o AQuA members experience and their accessibility teams. More details and links to sources are at the end of this document. 
 
Accessibility needs to be designed into applications from the outset, therefore use of this set of Testing Criteria is to be encouraged at the prototype development stage, before delivery of a finished product, and when further updates or amendments are made to the application, to ensure that accessibility is not broken by subsequent changes. As the tests only look at the Application's accessibility, the Application should also be tested against the AQuA Testing Criteria for IOS applications (which focuses on the general usability of the Application). 
 
Not all applications will be needed to be tested for all categories, and requirements across the different categories may be contradictory (e.g. enhancing the sound based feedback is great for improving accessibility for usage with limited vision, but may load too much information to audio for usage with limited hearing). Application providers will need to consider how to approach accessibility for different categories of impairment, as appropriate for their application and their audience. Therefore, rather than simply running all tests on any application, it will be necessary to understand which usage conditions are appropriate to an application, and only run those sections of the tests that are relevant to its intended use and audience. 
 
The Application will be considered to have passed the testing if it has passed for one category.  All passes will be categorized appropriately. (e.g. Pass for Usage With Limited Vision). Note that a judgement call will need to be made on whether to test for usage with a particular limitation, i.e. it may not always be appropriate for a sound-based application to be tested for usage with limited hearing - although, conversely, users with limited hearing may still be able to enjoy part of the frequency range of a music player application. 
 
 
General points to note 
Applications intended to meet the needs of users with specific impairments should not be developed in isolation from the users they intend to support; rather, wherever possible the developer should maintain contact with appropriate organizations or communities, and should seek to involve representatives in design and testing.  
 
These tests are written so they can be performed by a tester without impairments.  However, we would advise that, if possible, there should be at least one cycle of testing carried out by people with the specific impairment or impairments which the tests address.  
 
When using this set of Testing Criteria, please bear in mind that it is not designed purely as a set of prescriptive step-by-step tests. Rather, it is a guide to questioning assumptions that may be made in the design and development stages, and of finding ways to check that those assumptions do not reduce usability. Such a process normally enhances usability. 
 
No specific distinction is made between accessibility features provided by an application and those provided by the device's operating system, as the focus is on the end user experience as a whole, which should ideally be seamless and consistent regardless of the source of the function. Within that context, it should be borne in mind that these tests are only intended for evaluating the behavior of applications or an update to them. 
 
The VoiceOver accessibility service will need to be enabled on the iOS device.  This can be found as an option under General / Accessibility in the device Settings menu.  
 
It is recommended that the tester goes through a tutorial for VoiceOver if they are unfamiliar with it.  Injudicious use can render the phone confusing to use as touch controls no longer function as expected by a sighted user - the tester should particularly note that single-tap only selects an item while VoiceOver is in use, and double-tap is always required to action a control or item. 
 
In summary, a developer or tester should be familiar with the operation of the following assistive technologies, all of which are built in on the iOS platform: 
 
•       VoiceOver (including Modifier Keys and Typing Feedback) 
•       Speak Screen 
•       Siri 
•       Dictation 
•       Larger Dynamic Type 
•       Zoom Magnifier 
•       Invert Colours & Greyscale 
•       Braille Displays 
•       FaceTime and iMessage  used for visual-only communications 
•       Mono Audio 
•       Rotor (including Text Selector options) 
•       Assistive Touch 
•       Switch Control (both Bluetooth and adaptor-connected types) 
•       Touch Accommodations (including Hold Duration, Ignore Repeat & Tap Assistance) 
•       Double-Tap Timeout 
•       Predictive Text 
•       Support for 3rd-party keyboards 
•       Sticky Keys and Slow Keys settings for use with 3rd-party keyboards 
•       Guided Access 
•       Visible & Vibrating Alerts 
•       Hearing Aid support (including Live Listen) 
 
For the developer, the accessibility of their app may be significantly improved if they can guide the user to enable the appropriate assistive technology for their impairment; and for the tester it is important to test an application in conjunction with the assistive technologies built into the device, to ensure a fair evaluation.

Structure of the Criteria 

The accessibility tests fall into basic categories (with a few sub-categories) for users with restrictions in that area. 
 
The categories or sub-categories are set out in this document as sections of tests. The Application may be tested against each section, or against several sections below: 
•       Usage with limited vision (includes usage without vision for the purposes of this document) 
•       Usage without perception of colour / minimising photosensitive seizure triggers 
•       Usage with limited hearing (includes usage without hearing for the purposes of this document) 
•       Usage without vocal capability 
•       Usage with limited manipulation or strength (includes usage with limited reach for the purposes of this document) 
•       Usage with limited cognition 
 
Each category is broken down into a set of functional areas: 
•       Navigation 
•       Control (execution of actions) 
•       Feedback 
•       Display 
•       Adjustments / Settings 
•       External devices 
 
External devices include but are not limited to: 
•       Keypads 
•       D-pads 
•       Joystick 
•       Braille displays 
•       Induction loop 
•       Hearing aids 
•       Headsets 
•       Switch control 
•       Sip and puff control systems 
•       Location beacons 
 
             
Critical and Warning levels of Tests 

We recognise that many of the tests that are performed do not produce a binary result. They are often subjective leaving the interpretation to the tester. It is unfair therefore to fail an application for one minor error that may be down to a tester's opinion. 
 
To account for this, the individual tests are each marked as either Critical or Warning. 
 
Critical Level Tests 
As the name suggests, a Critical level test must be passed.   
If the Application fails the test then the Application has an overall fail. 
 
Warning Level Tests 
For a test which is considered Warning level, we have allowed for four different results; pass, annoying, difficult and impossible. 
 
These warning levels are described as follows; 
Pass = the Application has passed the test.  There are no issues 
Annoying = a minor error has occurred with the Application - e.g. one or two typos that would make the Application not perfect but still very useable 
Difficult = a more serious issue has occurred with the Application e.g. multiple typos making the Application difficult to use but not impossible 
Impossible = a very serious issue has occurred with the Application - the errors are so bad as to make the Application unusable. 
 
Once all appropriate tests have been carried out, points should be attributed according to the following scale. 
Warning levels: 
Annoying = 1 points 
Difficult = 2 points 
Impossible = 4 points 
For the Application to pass, the errors must not add up to more than 3 points. 4 points or more is a failure. 
 
Severity of error Warning test type Critical test type No error 0 points 0 points Annoying error 1 point  Difficult error 2 points  Impossible error 4 points  Fail test  5 points  
 
(As an example, the Application could have 3 annoying results, or 1 difficult and 1 
annoying and still pass.)

1.5.       Adjustments / Settings 
1.5.1.    Contrast Control 
Test ID 
1.5.1 Test Title 
Contrast Control Critical Test Description 
The Application should offer different display contrast levels. Required for: 
All applications. Testing Note 
1.    To pass this test, the Application should offer a minimum contrast ratio between background and text / elements of 4.5:1 to meet the WCAG2.0 level AA standard. See http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G18.html for details of the W3C recommendations.  
2.    For the purposes of this test, it is not necessary to formally measure the luminance of elements. It will be sufficient if the contrast appears, when judged by eye, to be not less than the 4.5:1 samples provided at http://trace.wisc.edu/contrast-ratio-examples/. The set of examples in the section headed "Text Samples that just pass at several Contrast Ratios" may provide the easiest comparison for judging by eye. 
 
Testing Steps 
1.    Launch the Application. 
2.    If the Application does not offer a high-contrast display by default, open its Settings and confirm that there is at least one high-contrast display option. 
3.    Check that the either the provided default or the high-contrast display option provides a contrast level that meets the recommended standard. 
 
RESULT:  
The Application should offer a high-contrast display option that gives a significant contrast increase when used. Result of Test 
 
 PASS               FAIL 
  
 
 
 
 
 
             
1.5.2.    Volume control 
Test ID 
1.5.2 Test Title 
Volume control Critical Test Description 
Audio prompt volume should be sufficient and remain responsive to device controls. Required for: 
All applications. Testing Note 
Ensure that the VoiceOver accessibility service is enabled when testing. 
 
Testing Steps 
1.    Launch the Application. 
2.    Examine the Application's Settings and audio controls for evidence of any option to boost the maximum volume above the maximum normally offered, e.g. for speaker announcement of prompts in noisy situations. If such an option exists, the test should be performed once with it off, and once with it at the maximum setting. 
3.    Check that it is possible to achieve an adequate volume level for prompts to be clearly heard. Volume level without any boost should be at least sufficient for normal usage indoors, but where the Application would normally be expected to be used outdoors at least part of the time, the volume level achieved - with boost if offered - should be sufficient for this usage. If the Application is expressly designed for use only with headphones and makes this clear to the user, adequate headphone volume will be sufficient. 
4.    Check that the volume delivered responds promptly to the operation of the device volume keys. 
5.    Where a boosted volume is such that there is a risk of hearing damage if the device is held close to the ear, check that "press and hold" of the device Volume Down key can reduce the volume to safe levels within a second or less.

3.    It will not be acceptable to require use of 3rd-party keyboard options such as Sticky Keys or Slow Keys unless the Application is only intended to be used in conjunction with a 3rd-party keyboard, and that is made clear in its description. 
 
Testing Steps 
1.    Launch the Application. 
2.    Where the Settings of the Application offer options relevant to users with limited dexterity, ensure those options are selected. 
3.    Check that any control simplifying / combining options would be useful to a user with limited dexterity, and no commonly-used combinations have been omitted. 
 
RESULT:  
The Application should offer assistive options for control that will assist a user with dexterity impairment, and commonly-used options are not omitted. Result of Test

5.2.2.    Pressure-related input options 
Test ID 
5.2.2 Test Title 
Pressure-related input options Critical Test Description 
Applications should offer input methods for users with limited ability to control touch input. Required for: 
All applications. Testing Note 
1.    This test should concentrate on the needs of users with tremor or muscle control limitations that can create difficulty in maintaining consistent pressure or accuracy for touch / press / hold operations. 
2.    It will be acceptable if the Application is satisfactory when used in conjunction with iOS accessibility options such as Assistive Touch and Touch Accommodations. 
 
Testing Steps 
1.    Launch the Application. 
2.    Explore the functionality of the Application. 
3.    Check that the Application can be used without requiring distinction between single-tap, double-tap, long-press or press-and-drag actions (i.e. the Application responds to all these actions as if they are singletap). 
4.    Check that actions like play / pause functions are not limited to singletouch operation of the same control (e.g. separate controls rather than the same control changing function with each touch). 
5.    Check that any popup messages that contains confirm / cancel or other buttons are not positioned over controls in the background UI that could cause an undesired or irreversible action. The user may be unable to avoid touching twice in the same location, which could cause unintended operation of an underlying control when the popup is dismissed. 
 
RESULT:  
Options offered should be of genuine value to users with limitations in touch consistency or accuracy, and UI layout should avoid control positioning that risks unintended operation through multiple touches. Result of Test
