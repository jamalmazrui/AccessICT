What are Screen Readers
Screen readers are a form of assistive technology (AT) software that enables access to a computer, and all the things a computer does, by attempting to identify and interpret what is being displayed on the computer screen using text-to-speech. Screen readers can only access and process live text (fully editable or selectable text).
• Provides access to someone who is visually impaired, mobility or has a learning disability to access text on the screen.
• Offers same level of independence and privacy as anyone else.
Types of screen readers

Table Headers

• Screen readers keep track of their location in a table by counting table cells. 
• Screen readers also use header information to identify rows and columns.
• If a table is nested within another table or if a cell is merged or split, the screen reader loses count and can't provide helpful information about the table after that point. 
• When using tables, remember to keep their layout simple, don't merge cells or nest tables inside other tables.
• Be careful with empty rows and columns (blank cells). While they may sometimes be necessary to visually separate data, they can cause a screen reader user to think the sheet has ended, even when it has not.







Image Alternative or Alt Text• The purpose of Alt Text is to allow low vision or blind users who use text-to-speech assistive technologies (AT), such as screen readers, to understand the purpose of graphic images. Sighted users usually don't see alt text unless they use AT.
• Screen readers and other AT can't convert images into texts. So, when writing alt text, consider the following for images:o Describe the content and the purpose of the image clearly and concisely, in a phrase or a sentence or two. Keep alt text short 200 characters or less. o Image with text (for example, the CSUN wordmark) should include the words on the image. 
o "Image of...", "Photo of..." is not needed because screen readers and other AT announce that it's an "image" or "graphic".
Screen readers and other AT announce that it's an "image" or "graphic",  then read the alt text: "Three plants going through transformation with text quote Accessibility user-friendly document for CSUN student success."oWhen completing the alt text, use proper punctuation such as periods to indicate the end of the alt text. Without proper punctuation, some screen readers will run the alt text into the body text that follows and cause confusion to the user.oDon't insert hyperlinks in alt text because they are not clickable and can't create descriptive link text.  A stair chase leading up to an entryway is painted yellow with bold black text that reads museums are now.A hand reaches out of a computer screen giving the hand gesture for stop. The screen reads 'access denied!'On the left is the book cover for Haben The Deafblind

What are Decorative Images?
• Conveys no information; does not provide meaningful information.
• Purely for visual effect.
• The horizontal line that divided the two sections.
• Line border image used as part of page design.
• Decorative images do not require a text alternative.
• Decorative images, lines, borders, or shapes ignore by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.	
Add Alt Text to images
Add alt text to images, Smart Art graphics, shapes, charts so that screen readers can read the text to describe the image to users who can't see the image.
Select the image and right-click to select "Edit 
Alt Text"
Image Captions
• Captions are universal and accessible for everyone.
• Captions are read and visible to all users whether they use assistive technologies (AT) or not. 
• Captions and alt text have different purposes. 
• Captions convey what's visible in the image. 
• Alt text describes the visual aspect of the image and should be brief. 
• If captions and alt text are similar in their descriptions, alt text can be "Mark as decorative" to be ignored by the screen

• Don't repeat the image's caption as the alt text. People don't need to hear the same

Charts, graphs and maps use visuals to convey complex images to users. But since they are images, these media provide serious accessibility issues to colorblind users and users of screen readers. See the examples on this page for details on how to make charts more accessible. Visit Charts & Accessibility by Penn State
Provide descriptions if using color to convey meaning
