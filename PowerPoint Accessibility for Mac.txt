Screen readers are a form of assistive technology (AT) software that enables access to a computer, and all the things a computer does, by attempting to identify and interpret what is being displayed on the computer screen using text-to-speech. Screen readers can only access and process live text (fully editable or selectable text).
• Provides access to someone who is visually impaired, mobility or has a learning disability to access text on the screen.
• Offers same level of independence and privacy as anyone else.
Types of screen readers


Screen reader program for Microsoft Windows that allows blind and visually impaired users to read the screen either with a text-to-speech output or by a refreshable Braille display. NVDA screen reader can be downloaded free of charge by anyone.

How Do Screen Readers Work?
• Screen readers read line-by-line from left-to-right and top-to-bottom. 
• Screen readers start at the top of a document or website and read any text including alternative text for images, graphics or charts. 
• Screen readers navigate a document or website using the keyboard without a mouse. Tab key: jump from link to link, Enter: select a link, arrow keys: navigate a document or website.
• Reading order is important for users with visual challenges. The users can become confused if the document (content, tables, images or charts) is poorly organized or out of order.
Click vs Select
Screen readers and physical or mobility limitation users navigate a document or website using the keyboard without a mouse. The word "Click" is not inclusive of people who can't use the mouse. Use the 

word "Select" to write step-by-step instructions.
	"Click" or "Click on" Example	•
• Go to YouTube video player
• Click on Settings gear icon
• Click on Subtitles/CC
• Click on Options to Customize
• Click on Caption Style
Use "Select" Example (Recommend)
• Go to YouTube video player
• Select Settings gear icon
• Select Subtitles/CC
• Select Options to Customize
• Select Caption Style

Captioning Videos
Per federal and state law, and CSU policy, instructional media (e.g., videos, captured lectures, recorded presentations) must have captions. This includes instructional media used in classrooms, posted on websites or shared in Canvas.
• All students who are enrolled in a course must be able to access the content in the course.
• Faculty: Funding is available to help faculty generate captions and transcripts for instructional media. Materials should be submitted at least six weeks in advance of their use in instruction.
• Staff: For CSUN staff who do not provide classroom material, there is a cost through chargeback. For information on the chargeback, email ncod@csun.edu. csun.edu/captioning
• Slide Titles are meaningful and unique
• Maximum 6 to 8 lines of text per slide
• Minimum font size 24 points or above
• Tables, Charts and Graphs on own slide
• Sans-Serif fonts are more suited to electronic formats (Arial, Calibri, Verdana or Franklin Gothic Book)
• Avoid underlining text. Underlining is interpreted by screen readers and people with low vision as linked text.
• Avoid Transitions and Animations
• Be cautious with all All-caps text: Using all capitalized text can create accessibility issues, particularly for individuals with dyslexia or visual impairments, as it reduces readability and makes words harder to distinguish by shape. Screen readers may also misinterpret fully capitalized words, reading them letter by letter instead of as whole words. Additionally, all-caps text can slow down reading speed and comprehension for many users, making it less accessible for a broad audience. Credit to WebAIM February 2025 Newsletter.
Mysterious Dash or Hyphen
Screen readers do not know what the - symbol represents (minus, hyphen, en dash or em dash) so screen readers will not read it. It is always a good practice to spell the word and any abbreviations or make a reference to your abbreviation when used for the first time.
For examples:
• May 8th, 2022 from 3:30 - 5:00pm. The screen reader reads three, thirty five. Recommend May 8 , 2022 from 3:30 to 5:00pm.
• Final exams May 14 - 20, 2022, screen reader reads May 1420, 2022. Recommend May 14 to 20, 2022.
• Homework assignment pages 200 - 281 for tonight's reading material. Recommend pages 200 to 281. 
• The fiscal year 2015-2016. Recommend The fiscal year from 2015 to 2016.
• Grading scale 95 - 100%, screen reader reads 95100%. Recommend 95 to 100%. 
❖A + , screen reader reads A+. Recommend A plus.
❖A - , screen reader reads A. Recommend A minus.
❖Recommend to spell the word plus or minus for consistency purpose.
It's okay to use dash between compound words, i.e., well-known author, well-being, in-service, in-person, runner-up, part-time job, co-author, re-elect, long-term project, state-of-the-art technology, etc.


Text Shadow and Text Effects Font Styles
Avoid using Text Shadow and Text Effects font styles because PDF accessibility checker report an error  "Other elements alternate text - failed." due to two layers

Slide Designs - may not be accessible

The themes come with default background and foreground colors and fonts may be difficult for some viewers to see it. The Accessibility Checker in PowerPoint does not check for color contrast. Use simple and light background with dark text or dark background with white text is the best approach.

Slide Master Layouts aka Templates
• Master slides control the look of your entire presentation, including colors, fonts, backgrounds, effects, and just about everything else.
• If you need to add another box of text that is not in Slide Layout, use Slide Master to Insert Placeholder options.
• You can insert a shape or a logo on a slide master, and it will show up on all your slides automatically.
• Add Alt Text to describe an image or logo.
• Verify Slide Reading Order.
Slide Reading Order, 1 of 2
The order of slides content determines how the content will be presented to screen reader users, and other users of assistive technology. Verify reading order in the Slide Master layouts.

Verify in the Slide Master layouts. 
To check or fixing reading order of a slide, select Home > Arrange > Selection Pane. 
Reading order is shown in reverse, bottom to top. Click and drag or use the arrow buttons to change reading order.
When the screen reader reads this slide, it reads the objects in the reverse order listed in the Selection pane.
Important: The Title should always be read first as heading title. 
Assistive technology users such as screen readers navigate by slide title.

Outline View tips
• Use Outline View for a quick check of text accessibility and the read order.
• To ensure that the Title and body text are identified correctly in each slide, choose the Outline view. In this Outline View the text and the order in which it will be read by a screen reader can be seen. 
• Text can also be changed directly in the Outline view. Notice that tables, graphics and pictures will not show in Outline view. • Any text not in pre-existing Slide Layouts (text placed in text boxes that are manually added to the slide) or in the 'notes' section will not appear in the Outline view. 
• Screen readers may ignore items like text in text boxes that are added to the pages. Image Alternative or Alt Text• The purpose of Alt Text is to allow low vision or blind users who use text-to-speech assistive technologies (AT), such as screen readers, to understand the purpose of graphic images. Sighted users usually don't see alt text unless they use AT.
• Screen readers and other AT can't convert images into texts. So, when writing alt text, consider the following for images:o Describe the content and the purpose of the image clearly and concisely, in a phrase or a sentence or two. Keep alt text short 200 characters or less. o Image with text (for example, the CSUN wordmark) should include the words on the image. 
o "Image of...", "Photo of..." is not needed because screen readers and other AT announce that it's an "image" or "graphic".
Screen readers and other AT announce that it's an "image" or "graphic",  then read the alt text: "Three plants going through transformation with text quote Accessibility user-friendly document for CSUN student success."oWhen completing the alt text, use proper punctuation such as periods to indicate the end of the alt text. Without proper punctuation, some screen readers will run the alt text into the body text that follows and cause confusion to the user.oDon't insert hyperlinks in alt text because they are not clickable and can't create descriptive link text.  A stair chase leading up to an entryway is painted yellow with bold black text that reads museums are now.A hand reaches out of a computer screen giving the hand gesture for stop. The screen reads 'access denied!'On the left is the book cover for Haben The Deafblind

What are Decorative Images?
• Conveys no information; does not provide meaningful information.
• Purely for visual effect.
• The horizontal line that divided the two sections.
• Line border image used as part of page design.
• Decorative images do not require a text alternative.
• Decorative images, lines, borders, or shapes ignore by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.	
Image Captions
• Captions are universal and accessible for everyone.
• Captions are read and visible to all users whether they use assistive technologies (AT) or not. 
• Captions and alt text have different purposes. 
• Captions convey what's visible in the image. 
• Alt text describes the visual aspect of the image and should be brief. 
• If captions and alt text are similar in their descriptions, alt text can be "Mark as decorative" to be ignored by the screen

• Don't repeat the image's caption as the alt text. People don't need to hear the same 
	information twice.	Alt text: Mark as decorative

Acrobat explanation:
• Make sure that images in the document either have alternate text or are marked as artifacts.
• If we choose Fix from the Options menu, mark as decorative, screen readers will ignore the text "Introduction." Follow next slide how to avoid using Edit Text tool.
Create two separate layers: Title and Shape
Create two separate layers: 
 Don't fill the background color with text. Select title box, select Shape Fill, No 
Fill to clear the background • Layer #1: Keep slide title box without background color.
• Layer #2: In Drawing group, select rectangle shape, then right-click to select Edit Alt Text to mark as decorative for screen reader to ignore the shape.
• Select the rectangle shape to Send to Back so the text will be up front layer. Ensure slide title and background have color contrast. Use simple and light background with dark text or dark background with white text is the best approach. 
• Keep the shape and text as two separate layers; do not group them together.color.

Shapes
All SHAPES mark as decorative to ignore by the screen readers.
• Draw the shape under Drawing group
• Select the shape, right-click to select Edit Alt Text or Format tab

Group images or objects
DO NOT group images or objects together then adding alternative text (alt text) at once. PDF accessibility checker reports "Figures alternative text - Failed." Alt text or mark as decorative image/object individually.

Complex Images/Graphics/Charts
PowerPoint does not have Insert Caption feature like in MS Word, use one of built-in slide layouts to provide a longer description.
Some images, such as graphs, charts or informative illustrations require fairly lengthy explanations to make them accessible. 
Provide a brief alt text description of the image and a longer description within the slide. This may be helpful for others as well since some people have difficulty understanding charts and graphs. Credit to Explore Access
