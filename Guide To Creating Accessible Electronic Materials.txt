About This Guide   

 

The Assistive Technology Initiative (ATI) at George Mason University designed this user manual to provide information and guidance for the creation and testing of e-learning materials (i.e., documents, websites, and videos), including step-by-step procedures for access and use.

 

Some handouts within this manual are provided courtesy of the © 2012 Project GOALS from The National Center on Disability Access to Education (NCDAE). These documents were made possible for public use by a grant from the Fund for the Improvement  of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE), US Department of Education. For further information, please     visit www.ncdae.org.  

 

The ATI office operates under the Vice President for Compliance, Diversity, & Ethics at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.  For further information, please visit ati.gmu.edu.

Who Should Read This Document:

Any Mason faculty and/or staff members, who manage, develop, or distribute e-learning materials for individuals within the Mason community.  

How To Use This Document:

This manual was designed as a “just-in-time” resource to support Mason faculty and/or staff members with the creation of accessible e-learning content.  As such, it consists of a series of one-page “cheat sheets” that provide step-by-step procedures for incorporating accessibility into commonly used software applications.  This document can be reviewed in its entirety or individuals may pick and choose the “cheat sheets” that are most applicable to their current needs.   

 

For example, a faculty member may only use PowerPoint and Blackboard in their course this semester.  For that reason, they would only need to access the information specific to those tools while developing their course materials.

[] 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In this section, a brief overview is provided of the relevant disability laws and university policies, as well as their impact at George Mason University.   

 

 

 

 

Accessibility Laws and Policies at George Mason University   

[]

Making Accessible Documents   

 

 

[] 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In this section, specific tips and strategies are provided on how to create documents (i.e., Adobe, Word, and PPT) that are accessible to individuals with disabilities.   

 

Additionally, accessibility tools and simple techniques are discussed to help you identify and remediate common accessibility errors in your documents.   

 

 

 

 

Making Accessible Adobe Documents   

[]

 

             

         

 

 

[]CREATING ACCESSIBLE PDF DOCUMENTS 

IN ADOBE ACROBAT XI

1. Run “Make Accessible” wizard

[]Select Tools from the upper right corner, then select  Action Wizard > Make Accessible from the sidebar. Select Start button.

1. Add Document Description

– Enter a descriptive page Title. Other fields are optional.

2.  Set Open Options – Runs automatically

3.  Recognize Text using OCR –  If your PDF is not true text, it will be converted into true text during this step. If you are not sure if your PDF is true text, one easy test is to search for a word that you know occurs in the document. If no results are found, it needs to be converted to text.

4.  Detect Form Fields – Only necessary if your page contains fillable forms.

5.  Set Tab Order Property – Runs automatically 6. Set Reading Language

7.  []Add Tags to Document – PDF “tags” provide accessibility information to screen readers. If your document does not have tags they will be added during this step. You will need to check the quality of these  tags later on.

8.  Set Alternate Text –  A window will appear that allows you to add alternative text. Use the arrows to move between images and check

Decorative figure if the image should be ignored by a screen reader.

9.  Run Accessibility Full Check – This checker will show additional issues. Right click errors and warnings and select Fix to address the issues, Skip Rule if the issue has been addressed, and Explain to read online help.

2. Add/Change tags

The TouchUp Reading Order tool allows a user to quickly add and edit PDF tags and view the reading order of elements on the page. To edit tags, do the following.

[]1. From the right-hand menu, select Tools. 2. Then select

Accessibility >

TouchUp Reading Order. If the Accessibility option is not listed, use the Options button to check Accessibility on the menu.

3.  When selected, the view on the screen changes. All of the content is enclosed in numbered boxes. Each of these boxes represents a tag and the number corresponds with the reading order in the Order panel.

4.  Select the Structure Types radio button. The page will now display tag types instead of reading order.

5.  Within the TouchUp Reading Order window you will notice a group of buttons with the names of several common tags. You can use these buttons to assign tags to selected text or objects. Use the Text button for body text and the Heading 1-6 buttons to assign correct heading levels.

You can also add/edit the following tags in the TouchUp Reading Order tool:

Images and alternative text

1.  To tag a part of the page as an image, drag a box around the image and select the Figure button.

2.  To add or change alternative text, Right click on the image, select Edit Alternate Text.

3.  Enter the appropriate alternative text in the dialog box.

[]

Table headers

1.  Select a table and then select Table Inspector. Table header cells will be identified in red.

2.  Select a table or cell by dragging a box through the cells (not around them or you might select additional cells). Right click on a selected cell(s) and choose Table Cell Properties. A dialog box will appear.

3.  If the selected cell(s) needs to be tagged as a header, select the Header Cell option and assign a scope of either Row or Column.

Move items to/from the background

1.  Select an element you wish to move to the background (i.e., it will be ignored by a screen reader) and press the background button. This may include repetitive headers or footers.

2.  If a part of the page is not in a gray box then it is already in the background. If it should be read by a screen reader, select the item and press the appropriate button (e.g., Text, Heading 1-6, Figure).

3. Check/edit reading order

The TouchUp Reading order tool can also allow you to change the reading order of the page content so it matches the visual reading order.

1.  []Select the Page Content Order radio button. Reading order will now be displayed in the page instead of tag type.

2.  Select Show Order Panel. The Order Panel will appear in the left sidebar with numbers that correspond to the numbers in the page.

3.  To change the reading order of an element in this panel, click and drag the tag to the location that reflects the correct reading order.

Note

It is easier/better to make documents accessible as they are created. See our other cheatsheets to make documents accessible in MS Word, PowerPoint, and InDesign.

 Versus Microsoft Office Accessibility Wizard 

 

•       CommonLook Office is a one step process instead of Microsoft’s three.

 

•       CommonLook Office’s checks and prompts are based on Section 508 standards.  

 

•       CommonLook Office reduces the number of iterations, therefore reducing overall development time. Microsoft’s Accessibility Wizard locates errors, but the user must learn how to fix them.

 

•       CommLook Office, for example, automatically tags the document.  Whereas, the user would need to learn how to do this within Microsoft Office.

CREATING ACCESSIBLE MICROSOFT WORD 

2011 DOCUMENTS (MAC)

[]Headings

Create a uniform heading structure through use of styles in Word. This allows screen readers to navigate a document, and improves accessibility for everyone.

Adding and Editing Headings

Headings can be created using the Styles toolbar.

1.  Select the text and click on the appropriate style. 

(E.g. “Heading 1”)

2.  []
Headings 1, 2, or 3 can also be assigned using command + option + 1, 2, or 3, respectively.

Alternative text for Images Images can be given appropriate alternative text in Word. This text is read by a screen reader in a Word file and should remain intact when exporting to HTML or PDF.

1.  Right-click (or control + click) on the image and select Format Picture.  A dialog box will appear.

2.  []
Select the Alt Text option in the sidebar. Enter appropriate alternative text to the Description field, not the Title field.

If you do not see the Alt Text option, make sure you have the most up to date version of Word. Alternative text is available in Office 14.1 or newer.

•   There is no way to easily create table headers in Word.

•   The first row can be identified as table headers in PDF (but not in HTML). To do this, Right click on the first row in the table and select Table Properties > Row> Repeat as header row at the top of each page.

[]

Word automatically creates a hyperlink when a user pastes a full URL onto a page. These may not make sense to screen reader users, so more information is needed.

Editing Hyperlinks

1. Select a hyperlink, right click, and select Edit Hyperlink or command + k.

[]

Lists

Use true numbered and bulleted lists to emphasize a point or a sequence of steps. To create a list, select the  Numbered List or Bulleted List option in the main ribbon.

[]

•   Ensure that font size is sufficient, around 12 points.

•   Provide sufficient contrast.

•   Don’t use color as the only way to convey content.

•   Provide a table of contents, especially for  long documents.

•   Use simple language.

•   For a more widely supported file format, consider saving files as “Word 97-2004 Document (.doc)” format instead of the default “.docx” format.

[]CREATING ACCESSIBLE MICROSOFT POWERPOINT

2011 PRESENTATIONS (MAC)

Slide Layouts

[]Using slide layouts provided within PowerPoint will ensure that files have correctly structured headings and lists, and proper reading order.

Creating Slide

Layouts

1.  Select Home> New

Slide, or select the New Slide button from the default  tool bar.

2.  Choose from the slide options menu the desired layout.

Alternative text for Images

Images can be given appropriate alternative text in PowerPoint. This text is read by a screen reader in a PowerPoint file and should remain intact when exporting to HTML or PDF.

1.  Right-click (or control + click) on the image and select Format Picture. A dialog box will appear.

2.  Select the Alt Text option in the sidebar.

3.  Remove the image filename from the Description field. This is a bug in PowerPoint for Mac.

4. 

  -- ----
     
     []
  -- ----

Enter appropriate alternative text to the Description field, not the Title field.

Data Tables

•   PowerPoint can style rows and columns so they appear as data tables, but there is no way to add content in a way that will be identified by a screen reader.

•   If your presentation contains more than the simplest tables, and if you have Adobe Acrobat, consider creating an accessible PDF and adding the additional accessibility information in Acrobat Pro.

Links

PowerPoint automatically creates a hyperlink when a user pastes a full URL onto a page. These may not make sense to screen reader users, so more information is needed.

Editing Hyperlinks

[]

Outline and Notes Panels

PowerPoint contains two panels that can be used to enhance accessibility: the outline panel and the notes panel.

Outline Panel

•   The outline panel contains a text outline of the content that appears in your slides.

•   Reviewing this panel can help ensure the content on the slides is logically sequenced, that slide titles are unique and meaningful, and that reading order is appropriate for any user.

[]

Notes Panel

•   The notes panel allows the speaker to add notes and information that will not appear on the slides.

•   Placing image or chart descriptions in this area should be avoided. This information may not be accessed by a screen reader, so use with caution.

Other Principles

•   Ensure that font size is sufficient. If your presentation will be viewed on a projector, font size may need to be even larger.

•   Provide sufficient contrast. If your presentation will be viewed on a projector, sometimes the contrast needs to be even more pronounced.

•   Do not use color as the only way to convey content.

•   Avoid automatic slide transitions.

•   Use simple slide transitions when possible.

•   Use simple language.

•   Check reading order of text boxes that are not part of the native slide layout. They are usually the last thing read by a screen reader.

•   If you have embedded video, ensure that the video is captioned, and that the player controls are accessible.

•   If you have embedded audio, include a transcript.

•   If your slides contain animations, ensure that they are brief and do not distract from the most important content on the page.

•   For a more widely supported file format, consider saving files as “PowerPoint 97-2004 Presentation (.ppt)” format instead of the default “.pptx” format.

[]IDENTIFYING WEB ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES                                             []

While it takes a fairly technical background to detect all accessibility issues and features, there are many accessibility problems that can be quickly and easily identified without the need for a highly technical background. This handout will suggest a few free accessibility tools and offer 4 simple techniques to help you identify some common web accessibility problems.

1. Use the WAVE tool to detect errors

[]WAVE (wave.webaim.org) is a free online tool that can help you evaluate your page for accessibility. WAVE places color-coded icons over the page you are testing. While it takes some skill to interpret some icons, you can be sure that any red icon is an accessibility error to be addressed.

•   If you are not sure what an icon means, click on it and then select “More information”.

•   If you cannot see the icons correctly, select the No Styles button to view the page without styles. Although the page will look different, all icons should be visible.

•   You can also click on the Contrast button to identify text that may be difficult for some people to read.

2. Navigate without a mouse

Some users with motor disabilities, as well as those who are blind, have difficulty navigating the web using a mouse. Because of this, all web content must be accessible using the keyboard only. To test this, use the Tab key to navigate through links and forms (Shift + Tab to go backward) and the Enter key to perform an action. If you can’t get to what you want, or if your cursor gets trapped and can’t move, the page has an accessibility problem.

Note: If you are using Safari, you will need to enable the following preference first: Safari > Preferences > Advanced > Check “Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage”.

Check for the following issues:

•   []When you ‘Tab’ to a link with the keyboard it should be highlighted, usually with a dashed outline.  If you don’t see this outline this is a serious issue.

•   Ensure that the keyboard navigation order is logical. It should basically match the visual reading order of the page. (e.g., header, sidebar, main content, footer).

•   []Check for things that only work with a mouse (e.g., a navigation menu that expands when the user hovers over it with a mouse). See what happens if you try to navigate this same area with a keyboard.

•   []Some pages have a link at the beginning of the page that allows users to skip over top navigation to the main content on the page,  navigate to this link with Tab and then press Enter to activate the link. Ensure that the screen visually ‘jumps’ over the navigation to the beginning of the page. Hit Tab again and make sure that focus goes to the next link on the

page. If it jumps back to the top of the page, or if focus never moves from the top of the page in the first place, the skip link might be broken.

•   If any boxes pop open (e.g., slideshows, date pickers, warnings) make sure you can navigate and close these

[]

3. Zoom a page and enlarge text

Some users with visual disabilities enlarge page content for readability, but enlarging content on a page can sometimes cause layout problems. To make content larger, press Ctrl (Cmd on Mac) and + (plus). Ctrl and – (minus) makes content smaller and Ctrl and the number 0 will return to the default. Zoom the page several times and make sure everything is readable, especially images with text. It is fine if a horizontal scroll bar appears at the bottom of your window.

By default, zooming enlarges everything on the page, including images, but some users only enlarge text, so test this as well. To enlarge only text, do one of the following:

•                      Safari: View > Zoom Text Only

•                      Firefox: View > Zoom > Zoom Text Only

•                      Internet Explorer: View > Text size Then, enlarge the page at least 150%, and up to 200% (roughly 4-5 steps) and make sure none of the text becomes hidden or unreadable. It is fine if text wraps to a new line or if the page doesn’t look the same.

[]

100%                      150%                     200%

4. Other Recommendations to help you detect accessibility issues

•   Check videos for captions.

•   Look for links with generic link text such as “click here” or “more info.” These types of links can be confusing to blind screen reader users, and should be replaced with more descriptive link text.

•   []Check the page title (the text that appears in your browser tab) and make sure that it is unique  and descriptive.

•   Contact individuals with disabilities and see if they would be willing to review the site and identify issues they encounter.

How to Test Websites for Accessibility – Free Testing Tools   

WAVE 

 

WAVE, by WebAim, is a tool that provides quick feedback on the current state of a webpage. It displays results with green, yellow and red tags to show where violations may occur and where accessibility is already built in. 

 

[]
To test an Internet resource for accessibility, enter the URL into the space provided at the WebAim Wave port at http://wave.webaim.org/ 

 

The results will display on the left side of the page with a summary of issues. Errors are in red, yellow alerts need a human to test, and green checks are where accessibility is included.

 

[]

WAVE Firefox Extension 

 

WAVE also provides a toolbar extension for Firefox where you can run WAVE directly in Firefox. 

 

Visit WAVE Firefox Extension for more information.

 

Accessibility Management Platform 

 

The Accessibility Management Platform (AMP) is a web-based system with the capability to spider through an entire website and test for 508/Mobile/WCAG standards and highlight violations. 

 

It provides accessible code examples and best practices for how to correct violations. A clean, easy to read report is then published. 

 

Have a website tested for free at GMU using this tool.  Please visit Request a Web Accessibility Evaluation.  

 

Sample from AMP report below:

 

        [] 

Color Contrast Analyzer 

The Color Contrast Analyzer is a Google Chrome Extension. This extension allows a user to analyze color contrast on a single webpage according to the WCAG 2.0 color standards.  A user can choose to analyze a portion of the webpage, or the entire page. 

 

The automated process takes anywhere from 1-3 minutes and the results display a map of the outlined text that meets the standards.  

 

Any text that is not displayed in the results does not have enough contrast to meet the standards selected. 

 

Sample of results below:

Open AJAX Alliance 

 

The Open AJAX Alliance (OAA) is an accessibility add-on within Firefox. This plug in opens a sidebar to evaluate web pages for compliance to WCAG 2.0 success criteria and allows web developers to explore and inspect the accessibility of webpages. 

 

OAA displays a summary report with the number of violations, warnings, manual checks, and the percentage of accessibility included.   

[]

The sidebar supports both ARIA code and the reports can easily be sent to developers and managers to inform them of accessibility problems or demonstration of conformance.

Free Testing Tools   

             

Web Accessibility Toolbar in IE                        

             

The Web Accessibility Toolbar (WAT) is a             free download provided by the Paciello Group.  

 

This toolbar is built into Internet Explorer (IE) and provides quick and easy manual checks for web accessibility. 

 

With the WAT Toolbar, a user can check for headings, alt text for images, color contrast and more.

How to Test Websites for Accessibility Page Title   

Page Titles 

 

Good page titles are particularly important for orientation.  They help individuals move between pages that are open in their browser.  

 

Page titles can be: 

 

•       Shown in the window title bar in some browsers 

•       Shown in browsers' tabs when there are multiple web pages open 

•       Shown in search engine results

•       Used for browser bookmarks/favorites

•       Read by screen readers

•       In the web page markup is the

<title> within the <head>

 

What to Check  

 

•          Check that there is a title that adequately and briefly describes the content of the page and distinguishes the page from other web pages.

 

The example below shows the page title "Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility" in the title bar, and the titles of 4 pages in the tabs.  

 

Note that in the tabs, only the first part of the page title is shown.

 

[] 

 

Check Page Title with IE WAT (Beginner)  

 

Some versions of Internet Explorer (IE) have the title bar.  If so, the following steps are not needed.

 

•       Open the web page  

•       On toolbar, select "Structure"

•       Select "Heading structure"  o        Or, with keyboard: Ctrl+Alt+6, then down arrow key to "Heading

structure"

•       A new page opens

•       Page title is shown after "Title"

 

Additional Resources 

 

While there is flexibility on what makes a good page title, a best practice is for titles to be "front-loaded" with the important and unique identifying information first.

What to Check  

 

Links, and/or their associated title attributes, must be labeled correctly. 

•       A “Skip to Content” or “Skip Navigation” link should be located on a webpage in the upper right or left hand side of the screen. This link will allow keyboard and screen reader users to quickly access the main content of the page without navigating through all the main menus and navigation bars.

 

•       ‘Click here’, ‘More Info’, etc.

 

•       URLS that are spelled out, such as http://section508.gov/docs/exam ples/files/PPT/slide1.html instead of linking to text

Check with IE WAT (Beginner)  

 

Some versions of Internet Explorer (IE) have the title bar.  If so, the following steps are not needed.

 

•       Open the web page 

 

•       On toolbar, select "Doc Info"

 

•       Select "List Links" o           A new window will open

with a report

Guide to

Contact us

2-24-2014  

•       Review links provided in report o  For example: Link phrases

and words rather than write out URLs such as www.cnn.com/news/story

_PandaCam should be Panda Cam Story title

linked

 

•       Also, within the report:

o   Check the first few links under link content for a “Skip to Content” or “Skip Navigation” link

 

o   Use CTRL + F to open a “Find” toolbar at the top of the page and type the work

“skip” then press enter 

 

o   If “Skip” exists on that page,

the word will be highlighted

 

o   If that option does not bring up results, then there is no skip to content link present

Check Using Keyboard and/or Screen Reader (Intermediate) 

 

Screen readers such as NVDA or JAWS can be used to access a list of links on a page.  

 

•       Ensure the skip link is functioning correctly by: Tab to link > Enter >

Tab again

 

•       Watch for redundant title attributes

<a…title="Articles">Articles</a>

 

•       INSERT + F7 opens a dialog box where a list of all of the links on the

page will appear

 

•       Press the “S” key to search for all links that start with the letter “S” 

 

o     For example ‘Skip Navigation’, ‘Skip to Main’, ‘Skip to Content’, etc.  

 

 

 

 

Accessible Links   

Headings

 

Web pages often have sections of information separated by visual headings.  For example, heading text is bigger and bold.  Headings need to be "marked up" in the web page "code" (e.g., HTML). 

 

A “Heading” for a web page can be:

 

•       The title of the page, or

•       Titles of sections of the page

 

Ensure that all logical headings use the HTML heading tags.  In order for a screen reader to quickly access content, numbering headings is important. 

 

Heading levels should have a meaningful hierarchy, such as:

 

Heading Level 1 <h1>

Heading Level 2 <h2>

Heading Level 3 <h3>

Heading Level 3 <h3>

Heading Level 2 <h2>

Heading Level 3 <h3>

Heading Level 4 <h4>

Heading Level 4 <h4>

Heading Level 2 <h2>

 

 

Headings 

What to Check

 

•       The page has a heading

•       All pages should have at least one heading

•       All text that looks like a heading is marked up as a heading

•       All text that is marked up as a heading is really a conceptual section heading

•       The heading hierarchy is meaningful. Ideally the page starts

with an "h1" 

 

Check with IE WAT (Beginner)

 

Using the WAT Toolbar in Internet Explorer (IE):

 

•       Go to Structure and select

Heading Structure

 

•       Ensure that the heading

structure list is in order (<h1>, <h2>) and that the subheadings are labeled

 

 

 

 

 

 

Check Using Keyboard and/or Screen Reader (Intermediate)

 

Use a screen reader such as NVDA or JAWS to access a list of headings. 

 

•       For JAWS, press Insert+ F6 to open a list of headings. Arrow down through the list to ensure that the headings are in the correct order and that the list

does not skip subheadings

 

•       For NVDA, press Insert + F7 and select the Headings radio button at the top. This will bring up a list of headings on the page. Ensure that the headings are labeled and that the list

does not skip subheadings

•       Section Headings 

Alt Text 

 

Alt text should be functional and provide an equivalent user experience.  

 

Text alternatives ("alt text") convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. For example, individuals with visual impairments and use screen readers are able to hear the alt text read aloud.  

 

•       Appropriate text alternative for a search button ( []) would be "search",

not "magnifying glass"  

 

•       The ‘alt’ attribute is an attribute of the ‘img’ tag and is meant to be an alternative for non-visual browsers when they come across images. This ensures that a text equivalent is available when the image is not visible

on the page.  For example,

 

[] 

 

<img src="graphics/logo.gif"   

alt="George Mason University" / >   

 

 

•       If an image is not of importance and is used solely for visual needs, an alt text with open and closed quotes (“”) should be used. Empty ‘alt’ tags hide an image from a screen-reading

Guide to

application, so background images and aesthetic elements would be good

uses for this.  For example,  

 

[]

 

<image src="graphics/progress.gif" alt="" /

>

 

•       Background images cannot have an

‘alt’ text

 

o          Only images without informational content are allowed to be background images, or the information needs to be provided in an

alternative way

 

Check with IE WAT (Beginner) 

 

•       Use the WAT in Internet Explorer (IE)

 

•       Go to Images

 

•       Select Show Images to outline images 

 

•       Show alt text on the page o             If an error message appears,

select OK or press enter to

close the message 

 

•       Notice which images have No Alt attached to them  

Check Using Keyboard and/or Screen Reader (Intermediate) 

 

With JAWS, check Alt text for images or “Graphics” on a page:

 

•       Press the JAWS quick navigation key for graphics (G) on a web page  

 

•       Listen to how JAWS reads the graphics

 

•       If it reads a short, but descriptive title, then the image is labeled correctly.  

o    If it reads a long, drawn out label, or the name of the file image that does not represent the image, it is not labeled

correctly

 

•       With JAWS, press Insert + F3 to open the HTML elements dialog box o                      Arrow down to the graphics

list and press enter

 

o    A separate list of all graphics

will open

 

o    Check the list for the graphic

How to Test Websites for Accessibility                Form Fields, Error Messages, and Direct

Focus  

Form Fields 

 

There are 2 things to check:

•       Ensure the tab focus goes directly to each form field in the correct reading order of top to bottom, left to right

•       Ensure form fields are labeled  properly in the code.   

 

o   The code label should

be same as the form

name

o   If the field label is First Name, then the code label should also be First Name

 

Error Messages on Form Pages 

 

The user must be able to quickly identify any form fields that are not filled out correctly.  

 

For example, if an email address is required but was not filled out on a form, the form is submitted and an error message occurs.  The user needs to be able to quickly identify which fields are not filled out correctly. The error listing must receive focus directly after the user attempts to submit information to advance to the next screen.

Direct Focus Dialog Box  

 

When a new dialog box (pop-up box or window) is displayed, does the focus move to this dialog box? For example, if there is an error message from filling out a form and a separate dialog box is displayed with an error message, does this box take focus over the webpage or application? 

 

Check with IE WAT (Beginner) 

 

FORM FIELDS

•       Use the WAT in Internet  Explorer (IE)   

•       Select Structure  

•       Go to Fieldset/Labels

•       A dialog box will come up giving you the number of errors out of the number of form controls on the page

•       Any errors on the page will signify an invalid or missing label.

[]technically it's "luminance contrast."

 

What to Check

 

Web pages should have a minimum  contrast, by default.  A contrast ratio of

                                                                                                                           at least 4.5:1 for normal-size text.

Using Google Chrome

•       Download the Color Contrast Analyzer Extension

•       Click on the Extension, located in the top right of your page

Web Accessibility

In this section, the most commonly used Content Management Systems for Mason websites will be discussed. Instructions on how to incorporate accessibility with step-by-step instructions are included for content managers and web developers.  

 

 

 

 

CommonSpot Web Management Adding Labels to Form Fields   

Including Labels on Forms 

 

When building a form on your Common Spot page, it is important to include a label with every form field. When form fields do not explicitly include a label, assistive technologies may incorrectly render the label or provide no feedback at all to users. When labels are not present or are incorrect, users of assistive technologies may not be able to complete a form. 

 

To add labels to form fields, follow the steps below:

 

[]Step 1: After adding the Form Element to your page, click the yellow ‘+’ sign next to the Simple Form Element and select Edit Fields.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 2: Select Add New Field in the Edit Fields dialog box.

[]

Step 3: In the New Form Field dialog box, Select the field type, enter a field name and a label name. When finished, select Add Field. (Please Note: usually the label name is the same as the field name.)

 

[]

Forms and Usability 

 

When filling out the Form Field dialog box, if the field is going to be required, an asterisk (*) should be placed in front of the field name and the label to let users know that it is required. For example: ‘*Name’ would be entered in the Field Name and the Label field if it is a required field. 

 

See the next example for an accessible, usable form. Notice how there is also a note stating that the required fields are marked with an (*) asterisk to let the user know of the required fields. 

For more information about how to create a form, contact your web developer.

Heading Levels 

 

It is best practice to ensure that heading levels have a meaningful hierarchy and do not skip levels such as H1 to H3. You should always have an H2 before adding an H3. See example below for a structured heading order:

 

Main Page Title (Heading 1)

            Sub-Heading (Heading 2)                       Sub-Heading (Heading 3)           Sub-Heading (Heading 2)

                         Sub-Heading (Heading 3)

 

[]
Some CommonSpot web pages must have Heading 1 coded by a web developer if the main heading is also the main title of the page. Content managers may not have access to updating this. See example below:

One of the top best practices for accessibility is keyboard access. In other words, would someone be able to access your website using just the keyboard and not the mouse? This functionality is important for users with visual impairments and mobility impairments who cannot use a mouse.  

 

This can be accomplished by ensuring that elements that utilize devicedependent event handlers (mouse only) are not the sole means of providing dynamic functionality.  

 

Content managers and developers can incorporate this by providing a redundant device-dependent event handler in the code to allow users of assistive technologies a method to access the functionality. If a “Mouse” or “Click” handler is used, an alternative must be added. See below for examples.

 

Event Handler            Alternative

CommonSpot Web Management – Image Description (Alt Text)   

What is an “Alt” Text (tag)?

 

Alt tags are descriptions for images that communicate the meaning of the image to users of assistive technologies and text-only browsers. This is very important for accessibility and is a best practice that should be followed. CommonSpot allows the addition of alternative text for images, but it must be included by the content manager/developer. It is not automatically added.  

 

To add alt tags to images on your CommonSpot page, follow the steps below:

 

Step 1: Select the gear icon for your image and select Image

[]

Step 2: In the Image Properties dialog box, type in the text description in the Alternate Image Text field and click Save - See next example:

[]tag of a double quote (“”). This will “hide” the image in the background so that it will not be noticed by assistive technologies, even though it is still visible on the page. Without this null or voided alt tag, assistive technologies may pick up the image as “blank” or “graphic” without any context to the user. The user would not know if this was an image of importance or not.

[]Adding Headers in Blackboard   

About 

 

Blackboard® is usable and accessible. The National Federation of the Blind

(NFB) recently awarded Blackboard

Learn™, Release 9.1 and later with a Nonvisual Accessibility Gold Certification, making it the first learning management system to achieve certification. Blackboard measures and evaluates accessibility levels using two sets of standards: the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) issued by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act issued in the United States federal government.

How it Works 

 

Blackboard is fairly accessible out of the box.  It is up to the faculty member to continue the accessibility when creating Modules, Items, etc. within the course.  When creating a new Module or other Learning Content you will often see the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) edit box where you can add content.  When adding content to courses, there are multiple ways you can include accessibility.  

 

Let’s begin by looking at adding Headers.  Headers should be used in a logical order starting with Header 1

This feature should be used throughout all Modules created. Each Module  would follow the same setup from H1 – H3, etc.  

 

Here is an example of multiple headings used:

Adding  a Table and Setting Table Headings in Blackboard   

[]How it Works

 

Blackboard is fairly accessible out of the box.  It is up to the professor to continue the accessibility when creating Modules, Items, etc. within the course. When creating a new Module  or other Learning Content you will often see the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) edit box where you can add content.  When adding content to courses there are multiple ways you can include accessibility.   

 

Let’s begin by looking at adding Tables.  There are two types of tables (1) data and (2) layout/presentation.  Data tables don’t necessary have to have numbers to be considered “Data”.  Any table presenting information that has a set header that would follow

through the rows and columns would  be considered a Data table. All Data  tables need headers set in the Row and Column headers. These headers  should always be set as Header (H1)

Adding Accessibility

 

When you add a Table in a Module the Insert/Edit Table box opens. Check  

the “Table Caption” at the bottom of the General Tab.           

                                                                            Once you have created the specifics of

                                                                             your table, hit Insert. The table will

show up in your Module.

Adding an Image and Tagging/Describing in Blackboard   

How it Works

 

Blackboard is fairly accessible out of the box.  It is up to the professor to continue the accessibility when creating Modules, Items, etc. within the course.  When creating a new Module or other Learning Content you will often see the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) edit box where you can add content.  When adding content to courses there are multiple ways you can include accessibility.  

 

Let’s begin by looking at adding Images.  There are two types of images (1) meaningful/important information and (2) presentation/show.  All images need “tagged” or described.  It depends upon what type of image as to the type of tag used.   

Adding Accessibility 

 

When you add an Image in a Module the Insert/Edit Image box opens.  Under the general tab you select the location of your image.  You MUST enter a description.  Entering a Title is helpful but should not be identical to the description.   

 

[]Here you have an area that you can either enter in a long description describing the chart or graph.

[]Adding a Video in Blackboard  

How it Works

 

Blackboard is fairly accessible out of the box.  It is up to the professor to continue the accessibility when creating Modules, Items, etc. within the course.  When creating a new Module or other Learning Content you will often see the WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) edit box where you can add content.  When adding content to courses there are multiple ways you can include accessibility.  

 

Let’s begin by looking at adding Videos.  

Adding Accessibility

 

There are two ways to add a video (1) through an item, module, etc. (2) directly adding it into the Build Content section by selecting Video.  It is best practice to add a video through an item, module, etc. 

 

When in the Item or Module, select the Embed or Add Video button.  Here, you can choose what type of file you would like to add.  It is best practice to use QuickTime and avoid the use of iframe and flash.  Also, whichever file format you choose, a download link of that application should also be added in the module.  For example, if

 

 

Using the Item or Module option allows you to add a description of the video within the WYSIWYG edit box.  You

can also include a file for a transcript and a link where someone can

download the video and/or open it into a new window.  (NOTE: Embedded videos are not always accessible to screen readers so it is best to give the

link in addition to the embedded video.)

 

The second way you can add a video is by directly adding it into the Build Content Section.  When doing this the video will automatically show up at the bottom of all content in Blackboard and it would need to be moved to the appropriate location.

 

  

By default, Video Options include Autostart, Loop and Add alignment to content checked as “No”. Maintain these settings. 

 

You can easily add a Transcript for the video/audio.  Select the Browse Button to Include a Transcript:

[] 

 

NOTE: Adding a transcript doesn’t make the video fully accessible, but does help add additional support for all students.

Blackboard Collaborate Web Conferencing - Built In Accessibility Features   

Blackboard Collaborate offers built-in features that are an integral part of the program but also aid in accessibility. These are more universal design features that can help anyone in the collaborate experience, but may be especially helpful for someone with a disability.  

Audible/Visual Notifications

These are system messages used to notify users when important events occur within the session. The following audible notifications should always be enabled and the default visual notifications should always be checked:

•  Chat Message Received

•  Microphone On/Off

•  Hand Raised/Lowered

•  Participant Joined/Left

•  Private Chat Message Received

 

To enable these features, from the Edit menu, select Preferences. This will bring up a Preferences dialog box.

Under General, select Audible Notifications:

Application Sharing Features

 

The following sections describe features that improve accessibility for low vision and color blind users:

 

Hosting Options: The Hosting Options allow you to define how to display the Application Sharing window while you are hosting an Application Sharing session. To access the Hosting Options, open the Preferences dialog box (from Edit Menu) then on the left side of the dialog box, you will see Hosting Options:

[]

 

It is recommended to keep the Hide content area un-checked, select a region highlight color (bright, bold colors such as yellow, orange or blue), keep Raise shared applications to front checked, select emphasize cursor (will display a colored ring around your cursor so that it’s more visible and easy to follow) and check Show Notification (this will bring up a dialog box to let users know you are about to share an application). Make these changes to your options and click Apply and Close.

Messaging Chat Options

 

You can set the font size of the text in the conversation (messaging) pane anywhere from 7 points to 109 points, in increments of 2 points. The default value is 13 points. To increase/decrease the font size, do one of the following:

•       From the Tools menu, select Chat and then Increase Font Size.  

•       From the Chat Options menu, select Increase Font Size.

 

Changing the Notes Text Size 

 

You can change the size of the font in the Notes text editor:

 

Blackboard Collaborate Web Conferencing - Built In Accessibility Features   

1)            To open the notes text window, go to Window in the menu bar, click Show Notes.

2)            Or to open the notes window, press Ctrl + E.

Closed Captioning (CC)

 

The Closed-Captioning feature enables a session attendee to transcribe audio information while a session is in progress.  

 

Other session attendees can view the transcribed text in the live session and in a recording of the session. It can also be saved to a text file. There are two types of Closed-Captioning windows: one for entering closedcaptioning text (input window) and one for reading the text (view-only window).

Granting CC Permission

 

The Closed-Captioning permission is not included in the default set of Global permissions – not even for Moderators (including yourself). Before Moderators and Participants can enter text in the Closed-Captioning input window, you must explicitly grant them the ClosedCaptioning permission

 

 

1)            To grant permission: Select the Closed Captioning permission icon in their participant menu.

 

2)            When they are granted permission, they will see the CC icon in their menu bar.    

 

[] 

Entering CC Text

 

Once you have been given permission to enter the closed-captioning text, open the Closed-Captioning input window by doing one of the following: • Click on the Closed-Captioning button at the top of the Audio & Video panel.

• From the Window menu, select Show Closed-Captioning. The CC box will come up:

 

[] 

Viewing CC Text

 

All Moderators and Participants, upon joining a session have the permission to view the text in the ClosedCaptioning window. To open the Closed-Captioning view-only window, do one of the following:

•              Enter Control+F8 (Command-F8 on Mac) • From the Window menu, select Closed-Captioning.

•              If someone in the session has been granted the permission to enter captions, you will see the ClosedCaptioning button at the top of your Audio & Video panel. Click on it to open the view-only window.

Saving CC Text

 

• You can save the closed-captioning text by selecting Save from the Options menu in either of the ClosedCaptioning windows (input or view).  • Each time you close the ClosedCaptioning window a new transcript is started, so only the captions that were entered since the last time you opened the window will be saved.

Lecture-Capture Tools and Accessibility   

 

 

[] 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In this section, general accessibility information is provided concerning three lecture capture solutions that are commonly used by faculty on Mason campuses: Adobe Presenter, Camtasia, and Adobe Captivate.  

 

Additionally, alternative options are provided to ensure equivalent access to the course content and additional

resources to improve the accessibility of

                                                                                                               your lecture capture videos.  

 

 

 

Lecture-Capture Tools - Camtasia, Captivate, and Presenter Accessibility   

Note: The purpose of this page is to provide more detailed accessibility information regarding these three commonly used lecture capture solutions on Mason campuses: Adobe Presenter, Techsmith Camtasia, and Adobe Captivate. Additionally, alternative options for ensuring equivalent access to the course content and additional resources are provided.

Accessibility Challenges*  

*Note:  The following information relates to the final output (i.e., video) of the application, not  the authoring tools.

Users of assistive technology (i.e., screen-reading, screen magnification, captions) will be impacted by the following:

•                Very limited keyboard access - Only the Play, Pause, and Slider Positioning buttons can be accessed by keyboard.

[Camtasia]  

•                Screen-reading applications are unable to identify any of the Camtasia video player controls.

[Camtasia]  

•      Alternative text descriptions must be provided for interactive video elements (i.e., callouts,

buttons,             questions, etc.)

| Captivate        | Captivate is a screen recording and video editing software application. While similar to  Camtasia and Presenter in many ways, it is much more robust. Consequently, it is also  more expensive than the two previous applications. It offers a great deal more  accessibility support as well. It can be installed  on both a Mac and a PC.   |                                                       |                                                                                            |

Definitions   

1.    Alt Tag - Text used to describe an image. Example, the alt text for the GMU logo would be "George Mason Logo". This is what a screen reader user would hear when navigating to the logo.  

2.    Anchor - The text a link uses to refer to a website. This can make a big difference in a website’s search engine results.  

3.    Attribute - Links, tables and frames all have attributes. The attribute specifies extra information about an element such as a link or table title or a frame description.   

4.    Bookmark - A bookmark (aka "favorite") is a marker placed on web pages and files.  A bookmark would be useful to return to the page or file later or to recommend the page or file to someone else.

5.    Content Management System (CMS) - The Content Management System (or CMS) is a backend tool for managing a site’s content that separates said content from the design and functionality of the site. Using a CMS generally makes it easier to change the design or function of a site independent of the site’s content. It also (usually) makes it easier for content to be added to the site for people who are not designers.

6.    Dialog Box - A box that appears on a display screen to present information or request input i.e. Search Box.

7.    Drag and Drop - Clicking on an icon or selection, holding the mouse button down and moving the mouse to ‘drag’ the   selection to a new location. When the mouse button is released the item is ‘dropped’.   

8.    Element - In XML, an element is the central building block of any document. Individual elements can contain text, other elements, or both.

9.    Form Fields - Term for fields in a fillable form. Examples include First Name, Last Name, Phone Number, Email, etc.

10.  Homepage - The ‘front page’ of a website.  

11.  IE – Stands for “Internet Explorer.” One of the most popular web browsers, designed by Microsoft.

12.  JAWS - Stands for “Job Access With Speech.” Provides users who are visually impaired access to a computer through textto-speech. Reads everything on the computer screen.

 

Definitions  

13.  NVDA - Stands for “Non-Visual Desktop Access.” Free screen-reading application.         Provides users who are visually   impaired access to a computer through text-to-speech. Reads everything on the computer screen.   

14.  Navigation - Refers to the system that allows visitors to a website to move around that site. Navigation is most often thought of in terms of menus, but links within pages, breadcrumbs, related links, pagination, and any other links that allow a visitor to move from one page to another are included in navigation.

15.  Plugins - A special kind of web browser add-on. Plugins are essentially required add-ons, if viewing very specialized web pages. Examples include: Adobe Flash or Shockwave player, Microsoft Silverlight player, and Adobe Acrobat PDF reader.  

16.  Tabindex - The tabindex attribute specifies the tab order of an element (when the "tab" button is used for navigating).

17.  Template - A file used to create a consistent design across a website. Templates are often used in conjunction with a CMS and contain both structural information about how a site should be set up, but also stylistic information about how the site should look.

18.  URL - Stands for “Uniform Resource Locator.” The technical term for the address of a website or document on the web. For example, www.ati.gmu.edu is a URL.

19.  Usability - Refers to how easy it is for a visitor to use a website in its intended manner.  

20.  WAT - Stands for Web Accessibility Toolbar. It is a free toolbar, developed by the Paciello Group, that can be installed in IE for testing accessibility of webpages.

21.  Web Standards - Specifications recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium for standardizing website design. The main purpose of web standards is to make it easier for both designers and those who create web browsers to make sites that will appear consistent across platforms.

22.  WYSIWYG – Stands for “What You See Is What You Get”.  A WYSIWYG editor is one that enables the user to see on the computer screen exactly what will appear when the document/webpage is finished. It eliminates the user’s need to know how  to manipulate programming code (e.g., HTML).
