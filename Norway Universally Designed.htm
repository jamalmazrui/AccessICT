<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The Ministry of Children and Equality is responsible for
promoting equality and preventing discrimination on the basis of gender, age,
sexual orientation, skin colour, ethnicity, religion or disability. Through
this action plan for universal design and increased accessibility, the
government is bringing both the equality policy and sustainability policy an
important step further.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>For people with a disability, accessibility is an important
factor in their ability to take part in society. A lack of accessibility has a
discriminatory effect. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The Government’s work is based on universal design.
Universal design is an expression of a value put on equality by society. Basing
social developments on universal design provides better and more equal
surroundings for people with a disability. It also results in social qualities
that are positive for the entire population and for Norway as a society.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Universal design also contributes to social and economic
sustainability and is therefore part of the national sustainability strategy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>This is a plan that affects most areas of society. All the
ministries are involved in implementing the plan.  A wide range of tools is to
be used to reach all levels of the public sector and help to develop the
private sector.  This work will be coordinated with the National Transport Plan
2010-2019.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:25.6pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The government’s vision is for Norway to be universally
designed by 2025.  This is ambitious but possible. The action plan shows how
the government will lay the foundation for achieving this ambition through
various goals and measures that are subject to deadlines.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The goal of increased accessibility in society has high
priority. The Soria Moria Declaration states that the parties in power will
prepare an action plan concerning the accessibility of transport, buildings,
information and other important areas of society. The Declaration also states
that a binding timetable for accessibility also has to be ensured and that the
principle of universal design is to form the basis for the government’s work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The government wants to get away from a way of thinking in
which the individual is defined as the problem and in which special measures
for people with disabilities are the main solution. The universal design of the
physical environment means an equal form of accessibility, so that the main
solution can be used by as many people as possible. This applies not only to
people with disabilities but also, for example, to families with children in
pushchairs and to the elderly. The government will make systematic efforts to
promote knowledge and stipulate a requirement of universal design in the
development of the human-created environment.</p>

Anti-Discrimination and Accessibility Act) came into force. The new Act’s
objectives are to strengthen the legal protection against discrimination on the
grounds of disability and to prevent discrimination due, among other things, to
a lack of accessibility. The Act stipulates a duty to universally design
undertakings that offer goods or services to the general public. Public and private
undertakings that offer goods or services to the general public also have a
duty to make active efforts to ensure universal design. In addition, employers,
both public and private, must make active efforts to promote equality and
ensure equal opportunities and rights, regardless of functional impairment. </p>

accessibility and adaptation for people with disabilities can be safeguarded in
the Act. The Anti-Discrimination Legislation Commission is to submit its recommendations

2010-2019. This White Paper underlines that everyone has an equal right to
participate in society. The opportunity to move around in society easily,
efficiently and safely is crucial for being able to participate in working life
and social activities. The government will therefore develop and adapt the
transport system so that as many people as possible are ensured good mobility

2008 places emphasis on the fact that universal design, in the form of
workplaces being better adapted for people with disabilities, will reduce
exclusion from working life. It is important to increase the number of people
with disabilities who are in work. Increased participation in working life
would improve their economic standard of living. The universal design of public
transport, buildings and ICT increases their chances of education and work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Accessibility for people with disabilities has improved
over the past few years. Developments vary within the different areas of
society. Two surveys that have assessed the status of the work on universal
design and accessibility are: “Full participation for all, Trends
2001-2006”,published by the Norwegian Directorate of Health and the National
Centre for Documentation on Disability, and the “Status Report 2007 – Social
Developments for People with Disabilities”, published by the National Centre
for Documentation on Disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The first report shows that a number of the proposals in
Official Norwegian Report (NOU) 2001:22 From User to Citizen have either been
implemented or are being considered. The report shows that there have been
improvements in accessibility and universal design in the areas of buildings,
outdoor areas, transport and ICT as regards more attention being paid, better
regulations and higher levels of activity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The report also shows that there is some way left to go
before the overall goal of a society for everyone has been reached. People with
disabilities do not have the same access to important areas of society as the
rest of the population. The greatest challenges are linked to making the
existing surroundings universally designed. Later analyses and cost estimates
confirm the extent of the challenges. </p>

on Disability and the National Centre for Documentation on Disability in 2006.
It concluded that there is limited knowledge in Norway of accessibility and
universal design in important areas such as ICT, transport, buildings and
outdoor areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.0pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;

on the provisional results of the external evaluation of “The Government’s
Action Plan to ensure Increased Accessibility for People with Disabilities. A
plan to ensure universal design in important areas of society” (2005-2008). The
evaluation, which is being conducted by the Norwegian Institute for Urban and
Regional Research (NIBR), shows that the ministries’ sector responsibilities,
use of stimulating measures and development of accessibility and universal
design norms have been important contributions to the work of ensuring
universal design.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.45pt;margin-bottom:
12.3pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Norwegian status reports and international
comparisons indicate that Norway has come a long way in its legislation in a
number of areas, and has implemented universal design relatively well in its
public administration sector. These are central qualities for resolving the
challenges which remain and a good foundation for the further work. The
government therefore believes it is possible to achieve the vision of a
universally designed society by 2025. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The development of the action plan’s strategy and content
has taken place in consultation with relevant ministries and through several
processes that have requested the views of government departments, regional
administrative authorities, research institutions, the Norwegian State Council
on Disability, municipal and county council committees dealing with people with
disabilities, interest groups and professional organisations.</p>

margin-left:6.15pt'>It is an important principle in the government’s strategy
that the main solution for all new procurements, buildings and facilities
intended for the general public is to be universally designed. Plans are also
to be based on the principles of universal design. This is assured through such
things as legislation and guidelines and the efficient follow-up of these. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In important areas, such as existing buildings and outdoor
areas, both the extent and cost of upgrading to universal design are uncertain.
In addition, the responsibility has been divided among a number of different
bodies and owners. A survey conducted by the Norwegian Institute for Urban and
Regional Research (NIBR) shows that it will be very expensive to upgrade
existing buildings, facilities and outdoor areas intended for the general
public’s use.  Due to the major financial cost of upgrading existing buildings,
facilities and outdoor areas to universal design, a step-by-step and
prioritised approach has been adopted. The Planning and Building Act includes
the authority to issue regulations regarding upgrades to a standard that is
equivalent to universal design. Over time, requirements as to existing building
categories can be stipulated in separate regulations. The individual
regulations will determine the deadline for implementing the upgrade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Other surveys and analyses, however, show that the
additional costs are limited if the upgrade to universal design takes place
through planned maintenance and repair work. The government places emphasis on
utilising these opportunities.</p>

In the parliamentary bill, the government proposed increasing the grant for
operating and maintaining the railway network by NOK 818 million. Of this, the
aim is to spend NOK 758 million on increased maintenance of the railway
network. The maintenance measures will result in railway traffic being more
regular and punctual. In addition, the measures will improve safety, increase
accessibility and result in better information to the public. The government
also proposes spending NOK 483 million on railway line investments, of which
NOK 50 million will be spent on railway stations and junction developments to

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>There are currently limited national statistics showing the
accessibility of outdoor environments, buildings and facilities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:7.3pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The population and housing census in 2001 showed that
around 7% of all homes are both accessible and suitable as homes for wheelchair
users. Around 22% of those who are 80 years old or more live in homes that are
accessible to wheelchair users. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Data is available regarding the accessibility quality of
homes financed through the Housing Bank’s mortgage and grant schemes. More than
half of the 6 216 homes that were granted a Housing Bank basic mortgage to
erect or improve a home in 2007 met the requirements as to universal design
qualities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:9.65pt;margin-bottom:
12.3pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Measures have been implemented to improve the
knowledge of how accessible buildings and outdoor areas are. The Housing Bank
and the National Office of Building Technology and Administration are taking
part in the work of developing universal design indicators for buildings. This
work will in time lead to a better statistical overview of the status of the
universal design of housing, buildings and outdoor areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In addition, universal design is being encouraged in the
housing and construction sector through the Housing Bank’s financial
instruments, through legal instruments in the Planning and Building Act and the
regulations issued pursuant to it, and through the systematic increase in the
level of information and expertise among key players and consumers in general. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The new Planning and Building Act proposes tightening up
the building design requirements. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Universal design is required in new measures relating to
buildings, facilities and outdoor areas intended for use by the general
public.  An important element here is that a requirement of universal design
will be stipulated for buildings in which people work. This will increase the
opportunities for being able to start work and continue to work with a
disability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>This tightening up will be implemented in the technical

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>This action plan contains a number of measures intended to
help support the implementation of the new Act.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The management of the state buildings is divided among many
ministries, but a lot of the state-owned real estate in the private sector is
managed by Statsbygg. Statsbygg is subject to the Ministry of Government
Administration and Reform. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In total, Statsbygg manages around 2.3 million m2 of
building floor space, divided among more than 1,500 properties in Norway,
including Svalbard, and around 115 abroad. As from 1 January 2009, the real
estate increased by around 313,000 m2 in that the prison properties managed by
the Norwegian Correctional Services were transferred to Statsbygg.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>During the period from 2004-2005, Statsbygg extensively
registered the accessibility of its public buildings. The information is
registered in the ”Building for everyone” database, which also has a management
module and a general public module. 1.6 million m2 and 577 buildings are
registered in the database, along with reports on repair measures,
accessibility and pictures.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:6.05pt;margin-bottom:
12.3pt;margin-left:-.25pt'>Since 2005, Statsbygg has set aside a share of its
maintenance funds for measures to ensure universal design in existing
buildings. During the first few years, around 2% of the maintenance funds were
spent on universal design measures. Since 2007, the efforts have been
increased, in line with the goal of the new action plan, and a minimum of 6% of
the maintenance funds are now spent on universal design measures each year. In
total during the 2005-2008 period, just under NOK 76 million was spent on the universal
design of the buildings managed by Statsbygg.  At the beginning of 2009, the
remaining need for improvement is estimated to cost around NOK 400 million. The
need for improvement is based on the recommendations stated in the ”Building
for Everyone” guide published by the National Office of Building Technology and
Administration and the Housing Bank. The need will have to be reassessed when
the revised Planning and Building Act has been adopted and new regulations come
into force. </p>

facilities for sports and other physical activities through gaming funds.
Accessibility for people with disabilities and universal design are
incorporated into the criteria for the award of these funds. The Ministry will
further develop and strengthen this work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Existing church buildings represent a challenge with regard
to universal design. It is the local authorities and church councils that are
financially responsible for building, operating and maintaining churches, and
the Ministry may not instruct them.  Through the interest-compensation scheme
for repairing church buildings, the state has made conditions suitable for
churches to be secured and preserved. Universal design is one of the measures
covered by the scheme. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>School buildings are owned and run by local authorities,
county councils and the state. The Ministry of Education and Research is
responsible for the school sector and is responsible for the
interest-compensation scheme for school buildings that can, among other things,
be used for universal design. The work of the driving force unit at the
Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) includes preparing and
coordinating action plans for universal design in universities and university
colleges. </p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>There is a considerable amount of real estate in the health
sector. As regards existing buildings and premises, the initiative is being
taken to ensure universal design. The Ministry of Health and Care Services has
the overall responsibility for this. According to the Labour and Welfare
Administration Act, the Labour and Welfare Service (NAV) offices must, in so
far as possible, be designed based on the principle of universal design. The
Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion will contribute to the physical design
of the NAV offices meeting these requirements. </p>

Government Action Plan to ensure increased accessibility through universal
design, in cooperation with the ministries and many other bodies. A programme
involving 17 local authorities spread throughout the country was established.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>These pilot local authorities have become pioneer
municipalities for universal design in Norway. Their experiences have been
included in Report T-1472 ”Universal Design as a Local Authority Strategy”. A
new action plan implements a new generation of pilot programmes aimed at the
regional level, involving county governors and county councils.  Former pilot
local authorities will be included as resource municipalities. These efforts
will form an important part of the work of making Norway universally designed
by 2025, in accordance with the government’s vision.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The local authority programme is intended to show that
universal design has been included in the new Planning and Building Act as a
strategy for helping to make society accessible to all and to avoid
discrimination. Universal design is to form the basis of all planning. The term
”Outdoor areas” describes many purposes for areas, all of which are further
defined in the Act’s planning regulations.  The planning will thus promote the
design and adaptation of physical factors that provide equal opportunities for
taking part in society. This entails an innovative approach to planning and
design and an ambition to constantly find better and more inclusive solutions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The provisions and guidelines relating to the universal
design of outdoor areas can be linked to all the sub-objectives of the
following area objectives: ”Buildings and Facilities”, ”Green Structures” and
”Transport Facilities and Technical Infrastructure”. All outdoor areas, whether
for recreational or transport use, are to be planned so that they are
accessible to everyone and have universally designed areas in which people can
rest or carry out activities.  This applies both to new areas and when redesigning
existing ones. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The planning work is to be carried out by the local
authorities, county councils and private players and have an effect on the

therefore depend on many parties cooperating. Experience gained from
administering the AntiDiscrimination Act and Gender Equality Act is to be
included in these contexts.  </p>

No combined assessment of the state of the Norwegian public transport network
exists. Basically, it must be assumed there is a need for upgrading to
universal design at all bus stops and stations in the public transport network,
as well as at ferry quays. In addition to the actual bus stop or station, it is
important that the access to the public transport system is also universally
designed. This entails a need for targeted efforts over a long period. The
achievement of the goals in relation to the government’s vision of universal
design by 2025 must be assessed when the plan is reviewed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>An accessible transport system requires there to be
accessibility in every part of the travel chain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The travel chain comprises information on transport
alternatives, the journey to/from, and any stops at stations and bus stops. In
addition, there is the accessibility of the means of transport itself. A breach
in the travel chain means that one or more elements of the travel chain are not
accessible. When parts of a journey are inaccessible, the entire journey may
appear to be inaccessible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>In the public transport system, the travel chain has many
parts, many players and a spread distribution of responsibilities. In order to
ensure that the entire travel chain is safeguarded, the various players’
efforts must be coordinated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.75pt;margin-bottom:1.75pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:8.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The distribution of responsibility in the public transport
area requires a high level of cooperation between the players. In order to
ensure that the entire travel chain is safeguarded, the players’ efforts must
be coordinated. The Public Roads Administration will be a driving force in this
regional coordination work. It will take the initiative to implement common
projects and packages of measures in cooperation with the National Rail
Administration, county councils, regions and local authorities. The prioritisation
of the funds for the common projects will take place in close cooperation with
local authorities. The Ministry of Transport and Communications will prioritise
measures that will help to improve entire travel chains in the town areas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>As part of the Ministry’s work of improving the
accessibility of the public transport system, around NOK 50 million has been
awarded to a separate subsidy scheme each year since 2006. According to this
scheme, county councils and local authorities can apply for funding for
measures that support state accessibility measures within their own area of
responsibility. The objective of the scheme is to contribute to quicker and
more coordinated efforts on the part of all players. The intention is for this
scheme to continue during the plan period.</p>

meet requirements concerning accessibility to buses for people with
disabilities. The requirements are particularly aimed at the needs of those
with mobility difficulties, but requirements are also stipulated regarding
equipment and technical solutions. The intention is for regulations concerning
the universal design of commuter and express buses (motor vehicles carrying out
licensed transport), etc, to be issued in 2009. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>NSB (Norwegian State Railways) currently has a total of
around 14 different main types or variants of main types of rolling stock in
operation. Most of the renewal will take place through the acquisition of new
rolling stock. NSB has entered into a contract for 50 new train sets that meet
the universal design requirements to be delivered starting in 2012.  The new
rolling stock that NSB AS has ordered will be equipped with a small step that
can be pushed out to reduce the horizontal distance. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Older rolling stock that will be in use after 2010/2011

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The requirements concerning the new train sets have been
prepared in cooperation with the user organisations for people with
disabilities. The same requirements have been incorporated into proposed new
regulations to be issued pursuant to the Railways Act. The regulations are to
apply to all carriage of persons by rail in Norway, including trams and
underground and commuter trains. The aim is to issue the regulations regarding
this in 2009.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The requirements of accessibility and adaptation for people
with mobility difficulties on ships were implemented in 2004. The Norwegian
Maritime Directorate has also issued regulations concerning the universal
design requirement on passenger ships sailing in Norwegian waters, and these
apply to the access to the ship, communication and notifications, alarm systems
and movement within the ship. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The requirement of accessibility on main road ferry links
will be introduced gradually as the individual link is put out to tender. New
vessels that start to sail on links that are subject to tender must be
universally designed. Existing vessels that start to sail on links that are
subject to tender are subject to requirements that certain adaptations are to
be made to the ship. The Public Roads Administration is also working on
stipulating universal design requirements for existing vessels in so far as this
is technically and financially possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>There are around 360 railway stations with passenger
traffic in use in Norway today. Stations, stops, areas for the public and
facilities at the railway stations are of varying standard and in various
conditions. Many older stations have too short, too low or too narrow
platforms. For persons with mobility difficulties, different platform heights
at the stops and varying distances between the platform and the train are
particularly great obstacles. Considerable investments in the infrastructure
will be required to achieve satisfactory accessibility for passenger traffic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The Ministry of Transport and Communications has asked the
National Rail Administration to prepare a long-term plan for the development of
the railway with the aim of achieving universal design.  This means that the
principles of universal design are to form the basis of planning, designing and
building new station infrastructure. The National Rail Administration’s plan
for upgrading existing stations is based on long-term efforts, with the aim of
upgrading firstly to accessibility for everyone (at least one access route to
the platform is to be available), and secondly to full universal design. The
efforts will primarily be made where the measures will affect as many
travellers as possible so that the benefit will be greatest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:2.4pt;margin-bottom:12.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The trend towards a universally designed train service
depends, among other things, on the harmonisation of the platform height and
height of the interior train floor. The National Rail Administration and NSB
have jointly agreed on a platform height standard, so that NSB was able to base
its orders for new rolling stock on this in 2008. The benefit from raising the
platforms to 76cm in height will thus be achieved as the new train sets are
phased in.</p>

stopping places is the responsibility of the owner of the road. Around 6,500
bus stops on the trunk road network are owned by the state, while 60,000
stopping places and bus stops are on roads owned by county councils and local
authorities. For 2008, the Public Roads Administration budget for repairing bus
stops along the main road network was around NOK 100 million. The intention is
to maintain this level. A decision regarding and the financing of the upgrading
of these bus stops must be made and financed by local authorities and county

satisfactory at most of its airports. However, there are still challenges at
several airports, linked to the various elements in the travel chain from
arrival at the airport until the passenger goes on board the aircraft. </p>
